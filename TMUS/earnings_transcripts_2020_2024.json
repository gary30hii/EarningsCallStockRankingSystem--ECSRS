[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Welcome to the T-Mobile's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. On the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik our CFO; Neville Ray our President of Technology; Matt Staneff, our Chief Marketing Officer, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risks factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor tax book and other documents related to our Q4, and full year 2020 results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results, we discuss on this call, can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. Please note that we expect to file our annual report on Form 10-K later this month, final completion of our first year-end audit following our merger with Sprint. Results prior to the second quarter earnings materials represent the historical results standalone T-Mobile. Prior to our merger with Sprint, I will also note, that we will not comment directly or indirectly on the SEC's ongoing C-band auction, C-band spectrum or the post auction market structure. Likewise, we look forward to having a great discussion with you around our merger synergies and future business trends at our upcoming Analyst Day, and we focus today's Q&A on our 2020 results and guidance for 2021. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Thanks Jud. Hi, everybody. We are coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington offices today, we have some amazing results to cover, and we're going to jump right in. I did plan this call to be a little bit shorter than usual to respect your time, mindful that we're going to be seeing you for a much more in-depth discussion at our Analyst Day coming up just next month, our whole team is really looking forward to being with you. But today, we are so excited to share our Q4 and full year 2020 results. And with results like these, I never get tired of hosting these calls and talking about our business because as it turns out, 2020 was T-Mobile's best year ever across our major customer and financial metrics, not just because we're bigger now after our merger, but because of how our team delivered, and we kept up this year with a very strong Q4, beating expectations and showing that we have momentum on our side. So, our business is well positioned for success in 2021 and more importantly beyond. From network to synergies, to operations and new investment areas, T-Mobile showed again this quarter that we're positioned to win. Those of you that follow us, know that we are focused on three core ambitions. First, continuing to profitably outgrow the competition. Second, delivering bigger than expected merger synergies, faster than anticipated to drive scale and enterprise value. And third, making the decisions and investments to drive the long-term growth and the exciting cash generation potential of this company. As you look at our full year and Q4 results, it's clear that we're doing exactly that. And the thesis for our company has never been more clear. We're very rapidly leaping ahead of the pack on network, with the best assets, the best team and the most loved brand in our space. If we play our cards right, T-Mobile is positioned to stay ahead in the 5G race for years to come. This quarter showcased a few key points, that are important to understand when you look at T-Mobile and when you look at the whole competitive landscape. First, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history in 2020. Finishing on top of the pack again in Q4, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Look across the major players in this industry. And you'll note that only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability. Second point, T-Mobile delivered the industry's best churn on our flagship T-Mobile brand. And we did it by delivering the best-in-class experiences across network, value and customer service. Just let that sink in for just a second, the best churn in the industry. Although we don't normally report on T-Mobile brand specific churn, I did want to make that point clear. T-Mobile went from worst to first on churn with our winning formula. And that formula is only getting better as we pull away from the pack on 5G and more customers begin to care about that. And here's the point, we know how to apply that same formula to our much higher churning Sprint branded customers, creating a big potential tailwind on future performance once this integration is substantially complete. Third key point, our growth and profitability are fueled by the rapid unlocking of synergies, which we are achieving faster than expected, as today's numbers made very clear. And finally, these synergies have helped us deliver the nation's fastest biggest and most available 5G network, which is going to inform the competitive landscape for years to come. So, let's dive into these just a little bit. As you saw in January, when we shared our early customer results, we ended 2020 as the clear growth leader in wireless, profitably taking share again, despite all the complexities of our merger. In fact, we delivered our highest ever total postpaid net adds of 5.5 million, and we grew our postpaid phone base by an estimated 2.2 million and industry best. We did all that and still delivered strong financials building upon our improved scale from the merger, with over $50 billion in service revenue growing year-over-year, when our peers were relatively flat, and growing to $24.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In a quarter when Verizon sacrificed growth for profitability and AT&T sacrificed profit growth for customer growth, only T-Mobile delivered customer growth and profitability growth, beating consensus on both. And with our guidance that Peter will share in a moment, it looks like only T-Mobile is expected to deliver both again, in meaningful ways again, this year. Churn, as I mentioned, we also didn't miss a beat on churn. Our total postpaid phone churn across all brands was essentially flat year-over-year for both the full year and the fourth quarter compared to standalone T-Mobile a year ago. This is including the legacy Sprint customers that were churning at over 2% this time a year ago in Q4. And as I said, postpaid phone churn for our branded T-Mobile base was the lowest of all national carriers. And a company record low for Q4, a reflection of genuine customer loyalty that's earned by giving customers the best network and the best value with great customer experiences, something that the Un-carrier is truly famous for. And as we continue to integrate, we're bringing more of that same T-Mobile experience directly to our Sprint customers. As we saw in Q4, others may try to buy customer loyalty, because they see what we see, we're pulling ahead of the pack on network, and we're about to take all their customers. But unfortunately, their results show that it's painfully expensive and ultimately just a band-aid to mask to real drivers of why customers eventually leave. The fact is there are no shortcuts to creating genuine loyalty, and sustainably low churn. And I'm confident we'll see all of this play out down the road. And while we're talking about great customer experiences, just today, J.D. Power recognized T-Mobile for the Best Customer Care in wireless for the 21st time, and the 7th time in a row. Meaning we've earned more top honors than any other wireless provider in the history of their study. As you've heard me say before, T-Mobile now has the scale and the resources to do something that's never truly been done before, offer customers the best value and the best network. Perceived network quality was the moat around the Verizon and AT&T castles that allowed them to overcharge customers for years. But T-Mobile is freeing customers across the country from having to compromise. This evolution creates a path to penetrate further into prime customers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and it creates compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. One of the reasons all of this works is that only T-Mobile is operating in a synergy backed model, which allows us to simultaneously deliver customer and profit growth, while also investing big in the business. Let me say this, our national capital plan may be ambitious, but it's known, and it's supported by our massive synergies. We'll talk about this more next month, I expect. Let's talk about those synergies for a minute. We delivered $1.3 billion in run rate synergies in 2020. That's more than we guided last quarter and well ahead of our plan. This progress includes the start of our customer migration work, something that's key to unlocking synergies, and we already have over 4 million Sprint customers moved over to the T-Mobile network. I also told you that we expected synergies in 2021 to be more than double what they were in 2020. While we still expect it to double [indiscernible], as we now expect to realize $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in run rate synergies in 2021. These synergies allow us to make smart investments in the future. And that starts with the network. Only T-Mobile offers the fastest, biggest and most available 5G network in America. The country has never seen anything like this network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate, not just on 5G but on network performance overall. To have the best network you have to win across both coverage and capacity. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers 5G coverage across 1.6 million square miles reaching 280 million people, offering nearly 2.5 times more geographic coverage than AT&T and nearly four times that of Verizon's so called nationwide 5G. And we're also expanding our Ultra Capacity 5G at an unprecedented pace. This is where you see truly game changing speeds and capabilities enabled by the bigger channels of spectrum, found in mid band and millimeter wave. We brought Ultra Capacity 5G to 106 million people last year, 50 times more than Verizon's Ultra Wideband just crushing our goals. And now we're on to our next audacious goal to cover 200 million people nationwide by the end of this year. For a number of reasons, getting to 200 million is a much taller challenge, but we plan to the biggest network factory this country has ever seen. And we're up to the test. This is important. We're now running a huge deployment machine at pace with a proven rollout model, something that takes a long time to ramp, a process we started way back in early 2018. I expect we'll be talking more about this advantage next month also. And third parties are seeing the results. Just last week, new independent data from Open Signal was released and it's based on billions of measurements from real customers. And it proves T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G download speeds, fastest 5G upload speeds and they get a 5G signal more often than anyone else. And of course, you'll see these advantages in our marketing and messaging, including with our latest Superbowl message this weekend. Actually, I think the perception battle is the biggest one. We're all over. This team operates and executes. And our goal is to not miss opportunities. For example, we're increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprise and government, we see room to run here. We've competed mostly on price in the past if we're honest. And now we have a premium product that's increasingly the catalyst for our wins. On the consumer side, we're planning to add significantly more points of distribution and thousands of sales and service agents to reach beyond urban areas where we have historically had our big success. We have a multiyear expansion plan to bring real competition and a quality service to 50 million U.S. households in smaller markets where our market share is currently only half of what our national market share is. This is a huge opportunity to bring our Un-carrier story to more of America. And we'll soon roll out our 5G home broadband offerings to bring critical connectivity to rural parts of this country and actual competition to the cable operator. All of these opportunities are built on our game changing Ultra Capacity 5G that we are rapidly expanding across the country, further distancing ourselves from the competition every day. So, these are just a few things to whet your appetite. We'll dive deeper into each of these opportunities next month when you can hear directly from the leaders who are driving these growth areas. So hopefully, you get the idea that this team believes T-Mobile is well positioned. We will expand our front in Un-carrier strategy and capitalize on our emerging network leadership, our customer loving brand and our new scale as we tackle the challenges and opportunities that are ahead. As I said earlier, this wasn't just another great year T-Mobile. It was our best year yet, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history, while simultaneously delivering strong revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow growth. Only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster than expected unlocking of synergies. And only T-Mobile can say that we offer the nation's fastest, biggest, and most available 5G network. And we did all this, while navigating a pandemic that made us rethink how to best serve our customers and protect our employees and in only the first nine months after the merger. Great work by an amazing team. And you know what, we're just getting started. So, let me turn it over to Peter to take us through the financials and our guidance. Peter, take it away.\nPeter Osvaldik: Thanks Mike. As you can tell we're fired up, we finished the year with exceptionally strong results and there is no doubt we're entering 2021 with great momentum. After writing our second half guidance on our Q3 earnings call, we executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q4, so let's jump right in. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion driven primarily by our continued growth in postpaid customers. Cost of services of $3.8 billion reflects the accelerated volume of site uprights to support the rapid deployments of our 5G network as well as over $500 million in merger related cost as we continue our network integration. SG&A expenses of $4.8 billion included over a $150 million in merger related cost as we advanced our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $750 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were both better than consensus expectations and included merger related costs of $506 million or $0.40 per share in Q4 on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to over $6.7 billion ahead of our guidance and consensus expectations and included lease revenues of $1.2 billion. Our pretax merger related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA were $686 million. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.5 billion driven by our strong operating performance while cash purchases of property and equipments including satellite interest amounted to $3.8 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $583 million amounted to $476 million, an increase over Q3 even while funding our accelerated network investments. Postpaid ARPA or average revenue per accounts amounted to a $133.08 while postpaid phone ARPU was $47.86 as we continue to grow the number of customers per account and ARPU was in line with our Q2 ARPU as we had previously guided. A big shout out to our teams for great execution all around to deliver strong results in a very challenging year. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum carries into 2021 which is a peak investment year from an OpEx and EBITDA perspective while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between $4.0 million and $4.7 million reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth despite the ongoing COVID-19 impact on the switching environment. Going forward, we will focus our guidance and discussion of results on core adjusted EBITDA for improved clarity and transparency, given that we have deemphasized leasing as part of our value proposition. And I know it is how many of you look at our results since the merger already. We expect core adjusted EBITDA in 2021 to be between $22.6 billion and $23.1 billion. This is based on adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be in the range of $26.5 billion to $27.0 billion and includes leasing revenues of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion. A strong year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA reflects the expected growth in customers and service revenue as well as an expected increase in synergies partially offset by our investments to unlock profitable growth factors and an expectation of decreased switching activity driving higher customer acquisition expenses compared to 2020. Core adjusted EBITDA for 2021 also includes the full year impact of the non-cash expense from our master lease agreement with American tower. We call, this is the straight-line accounting impact resulting from the long-term nature of the agreement, which generates cash savings from day one, while allowing for full flexibility for network deployments. Merger related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes primarily driven by network activities. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $11.7 billion and $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is expected to be in the range of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. And importantly, this figure excludes proceeds related to the beneficial interest in securitization transactions, which is expected to be approximately $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and as classified and investing activities for accounting purposes. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting its growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, even with higher levels of investments, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we delivered $1.3 billion in synergies in 2020 and we should expect synergies in 2021 to between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion. Breaking down 2020 we realized approximately $700 million in network synergies primarily from avoided new site builds and early decommissioning. At the same time, we realized about $600 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand, expedited retail rationalization, and move quickly to evolve our organizational structure. As we look to 2021, synergies are likely to be fairly evenly split between network related and SG&A related savings, with roughly two-thirds coming from cost reductions and roughly one-third from avoided costs that are not reflected in run rate, P&L trends, similar to 2020. Altogether, we expect 2021 to be another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock significant expansion and future free cash flow that is so exciting. And I must mention ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen the balance sheet. Last month, we issued 3 billion of unsecured notes that set a record low yields for five-year, eight year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year secured notes below 3%. We will provide updated color around synergies, mid and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business at our Analyst Day next month. And we can't wait to have a great discussion. And before we open it up for questions about our 2020 results and our 2021 guidance, just a reminder that we're currently in a quiet period for Auction 107 and will therefore not make any comments related to that. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Philip Cusick with JP Morgan.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey guys, thanks a lot. One for Mike, one for Pete. Mike, can you talk about your customer strategy this year, I see aggressive two-year free line offers in the market and that should help units. How should we think about that going after accounts as well? And then second for Pete. Maybe dig into the EBITDA guide with double the synergies and a similar mix of cost reductions year-over-year versus avoidance. I think people wonder why it can't be better. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Hey Phil, thanks. You're a little muddled there, I think the first part of you're asking about the competitive environment and customer growth and account growth. We really like what we see. And we probably aren't surprised to hear that, because our model is proven over and over again to be flexible. And in times when there's incredibly intense competitive pressure, we find a way. And at times, when there's a more muted switching environment, we find a way. And that's what we're doing. And that's what you see in this very ambitious guide that we put in front of people today, with all the normal and usual caveats. So, we're really excited. And obviously, what we are expecting to see will be the 2021 year that hopefully transitions us back out by the end, some of the dynamics that have dominated the competitive landscape in '20 due to COVID-19, muted switching, challenged payment environments, recessionary circumstances, et cetera. We'll have to see how it goes. But the thing you should take, I think confidence in is that our plan is nimble and flexible. And we're able to call the audibles as we see them. As you saw with three quarters of very, very strong performance that we just kept off since the pandemic began. Now I think you were going to turn to Peter as well, for the second piece. I'll switch over to Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, thank you, Mike. And yeah, Phil you're a little muffled there. I think you were asking about EBITDA, as well as synergy capture, and whether both could be better is that, hopefully that's right. So, let's start with synergy. And we're [trading] [ph] $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion. Now remember, with nine months ago is when we closed this merger, and to already be delivering much faster than we anticipated $1.3 billion in 2020 alone and the guide of 2.7 to 3.0 in 2021 it's just showing actually the rapid pace of what's happening here. And if you remember, it's a multi-phased approach. And the vast majority of the synergies still come from network and decommissioning of the cell sites, some of the associated backhaul leases, et cetera. And the first step in that just to build the anchor network, and you see the rapid pace that Neville and his team are just dominating the delivery, the ramp up of the machine that's going to flow all the way through 2021. That part is what unlocks then the ongoing migration of customer traffic and customers on to the anchor network. And then of course, we can realize all those synergies on the back end. So, I've got to tell you, I'm fundamentally extremely excited about the $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in synergies for 2021 as well as the rapid pace on the network piece, which really sets us up for the back end there. In regards to EBITDA, again, let me give you a little more color. First, as you know, we were the only major carrier to show meaningful growth when comparing 2020 to proforma 2019. And our '21 guide highlights our commitment to the three priorities of profitably acquiring the competition, unlocking synergies bigger and faster, and investing in our business to set us up for the long-term growth and free cash flow generation. And the first in context is a couple of things that we want to highlight when thinking about 2020 and 2021. First, as you know, 2020, that's slightly over $500 million of COVID related costs, which were excluded from adjusted EBITDA with the majority of those now being part of the run rate of the business. 2021 also has a higher non-cash straight line lease expense associated with that agreement with American Tower, an agreement that has significant positive NPV cash savings from day one, and operational flexibility for Neville and his team to continue the rapid pace that he's deployed on. We also anticipate, as Mike said, a gradual return to higher switching in 2021, which comes with higher upfront sales expenses, of course, as the share taker in the industry, but also sets us up for that customer lifetime value benefit to the enterprise value of this business. And we're doing all of those things, and growing core EBITDA year-over-year, while we make investments in 2021, to enable their long-term success of the company. We heard about it from the network perspectives, you heard Mike talk about an enterprise as well as distribution expansion to capitalize on the network. So, if you consider all of those factors, it makes the guided core adjusted EBITDA that much more compelling, and highlights the success of a profitable growth and synergy backed model we are executing on, which is also beginning to deliver on the free cash flow unlock promise of the business, as you can see from that element of our guidance. So hopefully I captured all your questions and got that right.\nMike Sievert: That's a new strategy. If you come in muddled and we can't hear you we just start talking about whatever we want to say.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks for all that. All right.\nMike Sievert: All right. Operator, let's go back at the queue.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Hopefully you guys can hear me better than [Indiscernible] hey. I guess first follow-up, any way you can sort of size each one of those categories that Peter gave [indiscernible], so call in the $500 million for the COVID cost. But just give us some sort of relative important spend on each one of those items, I think will help a lot. And maybe Matt you can talk about how it sets you guys up for maybe better growth in '22? And what we can expect in terms of benefits from that? And then secondly, separate questions. Just can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and what you expect in '21 the basis or the guidance, especially in the last week we heard Comcast talk about [indiscernible] and leading them to the wireless market obviously [indiscernible] very competitive. Just how do you expect to see the competitive markets evolve as we go through '21?\nMike Sievert: That sounds great. I'm going to get Peter in a minute to second to unpack that. So, Peter, think about that EBITDA question and I'm going to go straight to Matt there because I think, John this competitive environment something we really should double click into and there are some things to say about Sprint churn as a tailwind, there's also some things to say about looking at the totality of our competitive environment across Verizon and AT&T. So, Matt why don't you pick up here?\nMatt Staneff: Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks Mike and John. So, it's interesting you asked about 2021 and I think what the important thing to do is go maybe take a year back and look at year ago. What's interesting a year ago in Q4, you had a competitive environment. You had one competitor taking a lot of nets, one competitor taking not that many nets and we fast forward a year in Q4 and you saw them flipped. But in totality, the amount of nets being produced in the competitive environment more or less the same. And so, to what Mike's been saying what we've been saying it's what we anticipated is a robust competitive environment that's evolving and changing with certain carriers taking more or less share and that's continuing to lead growth through that as we navigate the flexible model to really lead it. The other piece of the question when you look at where we've guided in '21, what the next phase of our integration is with Sprint is really churn. It's a churn story. We've yet to start to get to work. Have really doing what we did on the T-Mobile branded business, going from worst to first on churn with our Sprint business. That's in front of us. We've gotten something taken care with the brand transition, stores and sales and gross adds and we're starting to get into the space followed by the work on the network, delivering the entire value proposition in the Sprint base and so we see that as we start to move forward. It's not going to happen overnight. So, we're really going to get to work and I feel great about our recipe to deliver great churn into this front base. So that's where you're going to see some of that as well.\nMike Sievert: It's really important to hear that message. I mean, people had said, what's going on? Isn't somebody moving? What about AT&T, aren't they producing more nets now and what you just heard from Matt is that some total of phone net adds from AT&T and Verizon was the same this past Q4 as the prior year. And so those two kinds of tend to go back and forth. And at any given quarter, there's just dynamics. AT&T is plowing a surprising amount of money, missed big on EBITDA into some short-term customer loyalty things if you want to call them that to be generous. Verizon on the other hand, they didn't spend this much, and therefore, they didn't have the same kind of nets. I don't know what they're doing. And they might have been - they might have blown all the money paying [indiscernible] to tell them they're having the 5G miss. Because it feels good for them. So, I don't know where that money went. But it wasn't being plowed to the same extent into net adds and so they beat on earnings but missed on net. So just goes back and forth. Doesn't change our game plan at all. Our game plan is to continue driving genuine loyalty as you see in our T-Mobile brand being the lowest churning brand in the industry and then reapply that same playbook on the Sprint customers. And that's just such an exciting tailwind for our business. Now before we move on, I know you asked a question about EBITDA from Peter. So, let's switch over to Peter as well.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, thank you John. I'm not going to be able to guide to every one of those elements quantitatively but we did highlight a couple of them. Again, the $500 million of COVID related cost, vast majority of loans return to run rate of the business. And we talked a little bit about some incremental debt from the key premier connect the pledge in Q2 that was a very small component to lead so the vast majority of those target million are run rate cost in the business now. Now on American Tower, I think we talked about at least a couple hundred million drag from 2020 to 2021. But it's hard, it depends on how quickly and variability builds and what the priorities are there that could create some variability there. But that's how I think about, the least conceptually magnitude survives. And then you get into the other elements, the switching cost, the selling cost as well as the investments. And as Mike said that depends on what the environment looks like in front of us, and of course what we do every quarters, what we do best, best in the industry, we delivered profitable growth and meet or exceed our expectations that we put out therefore you and we adjust and that's what we're going to do here. But I can't breakout the individual components probably further than that for you, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, thank you.\nMike Sievert: Operator, let's go back to the phones, and then I'll ask my team here for one or two that if you feel like we need to hit, it will be widely appreciated to be heard by others on the call, I will go to Twitter as well. So, take a look at those and see if you want to see one of those. Janice, I'll sign that to you, if you want. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. One for Peter and one for Neville. For Peter, I'm wondering if you could characterize your approach to setting guidance and how it might be different from Braxton, since this is our first guidance under the Osvaldik regime and particularly interested in the net add guidance, which about double the average guidance that you guys have set for net adds for the last five years. And did you seem to beat that by sort of 50% to a 100%? And so, I'm looking at the net add guidance and thinking if this is a backstream guide, the real number could be something a little crazy. And then for Neville, are we still looking at 200 million pops covered by the end of the year with fast 5G on 2.5 gigahertz or it looks like things moved a little bit faster than expected in 4Q with CapEx deployment, could you exceed that? Thanks.\nNeville Ray: Let's start with Peter. Right. But yeah, well, let me start with that.\nJonathan Chaplin: How does the Osvaldik regime operate, Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Well, let me tell you this, Jonathan. It actually isn't the first time you're hearing it. You heard me give guidance on Q3 as well and of Q2, actually second half guidance and then updated that in Q3. And look where we came in, all right, which is again, what our commitments always is, is to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver against what we put out there. But I love how you're asking me about 4.0 million to 4.7 million postpaid net add guidance next year and getting excited about it. Because what, if you look at 2020, that guy did midpoint is over twice what AT&T did in total postpaid and almost three times what Verizon did. So that's the guidance. That's the excitement here. There's a couple of factors to play out in front of us, as we said. One of those is what is that return to in the switching environment. We obviously are still impacted by COVID. And the question is, how fast does that come in? That will change the playbook for us as we said. You saw us deliver in Q3, saw us deliver in Q4, and that's our commitment in the future. But how we do it and how we go about it is in reaction to what's happening in the marketplace at the moment in time. So, look, be excited about the guide because it's an amazing guide from 4 to 4.7 on postpaid nets and similarly on adjusted EBITDA, as we talked about.\nJonathan Chaplin: Peter, if I can just follow up on that quickly, if switching activity doesn't come back as you expect, can you still hit the guide?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, look, Jonathan. Our commitment and you saw us do it in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is again to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver on what we put out there to you. So, that's probably the philosophy but you should think of when you think of myself and Mike and how this team operates. And you saw it executed on and probably the most challenged switching environment that you could have imagined in Q2, Q3, as well as Q4 of this year. And so, I can't predict the COVID future, I wish I could get it all rid of it for all of us so that we can get out there and start living. But I can't. But I can tell you we're going to adapt and we're going to deliver. And that's the commitment to have from us.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, Peter. That's great.\nNeville Ray: So, let me pick up Jonathan. Well, man, I love the question, great so and before we go to 200 million this year, just got to celebrate the 100 million that we secured in 2020. 100 million, 106 million people covered with Ultra Capacity mid-band 5G. And just to do the competitive comparison that you've helped us with, it's about 50 times, 50 times the Verizon high-capacity footprint, which is pretty stunning. It's almost embarrassing when you think about it. So, love your question, because even though we have a huge lead, you're asking, can we get even further in front of our competition, and do more than we've said, we'll do it in '21. Obviously, we're going to push on every target, Jonathan. But I'll tell you this, the most exciting thing for me in '20 and Mike referenced this in his comments is the fact that we build an incredible network machine in 2020. And we have to build and upgrade a lot more sites in '21 to get to that 200 million covered people with the Ultra Capacity. So, we have the machine, we have the resources, the supply chain, the commitments, and we have the processes. And so, this machine is moving at real pace, 200 million people covered, is with Ultra Capacity is going to be a huge lead against what our competition has talked about, or said they can do. So, we'll keep pushing on it. But I'm super excited to be able to sit here with high confidence, and talk about delivering a nationwide high capacity, high, high-capacity network in the coming 11 months on top of a coverage network, which just blows the competition away. Our extended range, 5G capability there, Mike mentioned this again, more coverage on 5G than AT&T and Verizon combined. You have to let that sink in a little bit to really understand the position that we're in. And on top of that coverage layer, now we can add and pile on this mid band asset. So, tremendously excited about the progress we made in 2020, but we're just getting started on this thing. So, it's going to be a really fun year in '21.\nMike Sievert: I talked about this a little bit in my remarks. But I just want to underscore how remarkable it is the rate and pace that we're operating at right now. Because it's a real competitive differentiator. And this isn't something Neville and team are, they're doing something that's never been done before operating at this scale. It was many, many thousands of sites that had to be touched and upgraded with advanced 5G technology to get us to that a 106 million, let alone the 280 million people that are covered by extended range 5G. But that's now moving to tens of thousands of sites in 2021. Tens of thousands of macro sites with Ultra Capacity 5G. It's a massive undertaking. And we started it way back in 2018, planning and citing, permitting, design, in order to create a contiguous leading network. And it's not something that can be created overnight. And as I said, it's a real advantage, I think we're going to probably have an opportunity to talk a lot more about. So, terrific. Let's go back to the phones.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next phone question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Two questions, if I could. First Peter, I'm going to steal a little thunder probably from your Analyst Day. But as I think about longer term margins, there are some differences between your business and say Verizon's or AT&T's and that you tend to lease more backhaul rather than own it, you have lower industry - sorry lower retail prices. How do you think about the long-term margin potential of the business relative to your peers? And then, Mike, I wonder if you could just update us a bit on your progress in the areas where you have traditionally under indexed the business services market or business wireless market and then their rural markets? And where you've been growing? How can you give us some progress metrics, I guess, in those areas?\nMike Sievert: Yeah, sounds good. And you're right, Craig, we're going to double click into both of those, as I said in my remarks next month. And I will give Peter a chance to respond if he wants to steal his own thunder from next month. But, as we've said for a long time, we see fantastic cash production from this model at the margin rates that we already communicated we aspire to. We don't have to achieve the margin rates that Verizon has. In fact, your question is premised on the idea that they'll be able to hang on to that and that, I don't know that that's the case either. I don't know where theirs is going. I know ours is going up. And the cash production that we're able to produce in this business model with the margin rates that we've aspired to are just phenomenal and so exciting, and create a very, very valuable enterprise. And, there are differences in our model, and one of them is the internal growth rate. And so, when you think about our faster growth and the investments in present periods to get there, there will be differences between how we pursue our business plan and theirs. And it shows that we're more bullish because we have better assets and therefore are willing to invest in a longer tail and a better terminal value. And that's going to be experienced in this five-year planning horizon as one of the big differences. But, Peter, why don't we go to you and then Matt, I'll turn to you on the how are we doing on things like prime and small-town rural businesses? So, Peter, anything to add?\nPeter Osvaldik: Well thanks, Mike. Yeah, and I don't want to steal all my own thunder from Analyst Day, because Craig, I want you to come and attend, so I can't do that right this moment. But I think everything that Matt and Mike talked about earlier, and what Mike just expressed now from margin perspective, is exactly that. If our plan doesn't predicate that we need to get through a Verizon level margin, and one could really question whether they will be able to maintain it when you have the combination of the premium product in the form of our network and the premium value, how they're going to be able to justify that with their customers? But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to continue to profitably outgrow, and yeah, there's some incremental costs in the short run that come with that, particularly on the sales side, as you accrue much higher terminal value for doing that. And then you did talk about some of those structural differences, which are absolutely key, and come out in CapEx versus OpEx as you see. So that's why it's so important and exciting to think about what the ultimate free cash flow generation of this business is, which really takes out some of those differentials and focuses on the cash productivity. So, really excited to highlight and update some of these figures for you next month. I'm looking forward to doing that.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: And Matt small-town rural business?\nMatt Staneff: Yeah. Craig, that's a great question. As Mike said, we're going to dive deeper into an Analyst Day, but just a couple things, one is an overlooked part of our record results we had this year was success in business, in particular, in education and public sector. And one thing that you should know about our business, and we keep saying is we're nimble and we're flexible, and we show up and solve needs, when people have it. That's partly why we're able to do things through project in million, delivering solutions for kids to have to deal with the pandemic. And what's great about that, on the backside of it, is it opened up a lot of doors, but today, we're answering our call, in part because of the network perception, it's still lagging reality. But now that we're in the door proving how fast and nimble, we can help serve businesses in public sector, we have more and more culture rings. So, we're seeing great progress in this area. When you talk about rules on the heels that Neville build out on extended range 5G, I think that's one of the big things that's going to be a paradigm shifter this year is when you take the performance that we're seeing from the Ultra Capacity network and the speeds and the experience consumers have and bring it into rule and bring it to prime consumers. It's a game changer. And it's going to be another vector for us to continue to accelerate growth going forward as we move up market into prime customers who require the best of the best network. To-date, we have not had that we're going to get that very quickly on the heels of this build. So, we see a lot of upside going forward into these areas.\nMike Sievert: And hopefully, roger that, if I can be a little bit around your question. Can you give us more insights on consumer versus business? Businesses, both are killing it. Our big opportunity and in consumer right now, we're - that's ahead of us is small town rural, whereas I said, in my prepared remarks, we have half our national market share. And this is a huge swath of the country. So big, big potential tailwinds there. And in business, we posted double-digit growth, which, look, I mean, everybody's got a smartphone already. So, when you've got a business that's posting double-digit growth, it's because you're winning share. And as I said, in my remarks, we're winning share not just as a price cut now, please throw us a little piece so you can reply to your AT&T deal. We're winning strategic accounts, the whole account. And that's, and we're winning it based on our quality. And that's just a game changer. So very excited about what the potential could hold there. Diana Gilbert's on Twitter asks, do customers really understand the value of 5G? Or is there confusion over it? And also, she asked separately, what are the some of the use cases coming? No, they don't really yet. And it's a great question. Right now, something I think if you look at the country, something like low-double-digits of consumers with super phones have switched to 5G already that means most people it's just a twinkle in their eye. And 2021 is the year when FOMO unfolds. And you've got people, that you know who've got an incredible phone that works 10 times faster than yours. And they're able to do things with it that you can't and you start to say I need me some of that. And you start to realize that when you get it from T-Mobile, it's for real. It doesn't just work on certain street corners or when the leaves aren't out or you have a suction cup device to put in your window or whatever. It works across 200 million people, which is the goal we've articulated for this year with our highest capacity variant Ultra Capacity 5G. But to your point, it's not just going to be about smartphones, and I'm not going to get into it today. I'm sorry, it's a great question but we see lots of potential. And this is analogous to when 4G started. And we didn't see everything that would unfold in 4G with the digital lifestyles, mobile first digital lifestyles that we now lead but similarly with 5G which is an even bigger, more discontinuous innovation. We're going to see hardware and software innovations that transform how we live our lives on the go. And the question will be, what kind of a network capability will those innovators develop to? And we're convinced that it has to be a capability more like ours, that's widely available than that's available in isolated spots. And so, that's a really exciting thing that I'll get into in a little more detail another time. But thanks for those questions. And let's go back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good afternoon. Two questions if I could. First, you mentioned the growth that's embedded in the guidance for 2021. But given all the moving pieces, in revenue, you had a wholesale business, you picked up a Sprint prepaid business that left you. You talked about the COVID cost. Can you help level set what the right comfortable on a full year proforma basis should be for like the key metrics like service revenue and core EBITDA just so we could better understand what kind of growth rates are within the 2021 guidance? And then secondly, you mentioned the improvement in the T-Mobile heritage churn. And, as you delved into that performance, I was curious if there are any specific factors that you think had maybe an outsized contribution whether it's certain networks tax for those customers, whether it's the bundling of content, or other Un-carrier initiatives that you employed over the last few years? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yeah, I'll start with the second one, and then flip over to Peter, who will probably give you at least a qualitative if not quantitative answer. You know there's so many factors into this, but I don't know Matt, do you want to jump in?\nMatt Staneff: Yeah, Mike kind of hit it a little bit in the remarks. I mean, there's three things that really matter here. The value proposition you get, it's the network. And it's how about customer service works. And when you look at what we're delivering with this network, one thing that we also know, is perception lags reality. And what I can tell you our T-Mobile customers are seeing today is the reality of this network we have. And you see it, and how sticky they are in churn. We also announced these records on JD Power Awards. Seven in a row, 21 total, we're killing it in customer service. What Un-carrier move was that? Team of experts. It took us years to craft that and get it right. But you can just see what happens when it's right. And by the way, that's not yet at the Sprint base. We're working through that, that's in our plan to bring it forward. So those are some big dimensions that we look to that are structural, as we talked about, to really deliver this value proposition to our customers.\nMike Sievert: Genuine customer loyalty takes time. Yeah. So proforma comparisons Peter, one of the things we said in our remarks is we're the only ones that posted genuine growth in service revenues and EBITDA. And we stand behind that, it gets a little gooey when you try and get to the math behind it, to try and unpack it for you, but it's significant growth. Peter, do you want to at least give a qualitative picture?\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. And thank you, Mike, for the question. If I would look at it, we do provide disclosures in the fact book that attempt to do a good proforma, particularly on adjusted EBITDA, and you can look at lease revenues there as well. So, look at that in the fact book. But I would say if you add all that up, and you can do that math from fact book, core EBITDA is about $22 billion for 2020. And remember, that includes having excluded the 500 plus million of COVID costs and the benefits from a lower switcher environment that we saw in 2020. So, that's one way to look at it. And then when you put it in that context, the guide is pretty exciting as I said, that shows the significant 2020 to 2021 core EBITDA growth, despite factoring in those things like the COVID costs, the non-cash straight line lease expense, as well as the projected higher switching costs that we would see being the industry share taker, as we hoped switching picks up over the course of the year with COVID. So, that's probably where I would point you to is on the fact book, but I can tell you, if you look at it, that way, you can see the growth, even despite the investments that we're making that'll set us up for the discussion that we'll have hopefully next month.\nMike Sievert: And soon we have this problem, we'll about to start round tripping ourselves in this company which is exciting. Did you have one follow-up?\nMichael Rollins: Yeah, I was just saying thank you, for taking the questions.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks then. All right, let's go back to the phone. Operator?\nOperator: Absolutely, our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great, good evening. Peter, I just wanted to confirm the Shentel is not in your guidance and perhaps any color you could give on the transaction the synergy integration opportunities there? And then any updates on the 4G home broadband, how that's going, any subscriber numbers or adoption rates customer set scores, something to share on that?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, well let me start. Absolutely on Shentel, we're certainly looking forward to taking the next steps here, finalizing the purchase agreement and getting through the close and starting to do the same network integration, customer integration as we have with Sprint, so we just see it as part of the bigger picture, very pleased that we're getting to that point. Shentel in our best estimates, is included in the guidance that we provided. Of course, you'll than see once we close some geography changes between wholesale service revenue up into our service revenue and customer geography changes which will be of course as we always are very transparent one when we close the transaction. But it is included in there, and very excited to take the next steps there and welcome those customers into the T-Mobile family.\nMike Sievert: Peter you, and as I see you're out there. Do you want to comment on the transaction?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, I just repeat what Peter said, look, we're excited to get past the appraisal phase and we're absolutely looking forward to moving on with concluding a purchase and sale agreement, filing all the appropriate regulatory papers, getting regulatory approval, and we looking for hopefully looking for close sometime in Q2.\nMike Sievert: And Simon, quickly on home Internet, yeah, thanks for bringing that up. I mentioned a little bit in my remarks, we're really excited. We're in pilot phase right now. We quietly moved from LTE pilot to 5G pilot. That was an exciting milestone in this pilot. And part of what we're doing here is we're just taking our time and making sure that we put together the experience space that we need. And that means supply chain, it means customer experience, it means really being able to create a quality service. And so far, we really liking what we're seeing. So, as this network capacity starts to really hit its pace in 2021, we've got a big opportunity to get commercial and to really go out there and start attracting customers in bigger numbers. The results so far with customers we have attracted, we're delighted with and customers are too. So, that's going really, really well. This is a chance to bring real competition to this space. And our business plan relies on it, we've got a pretty significant set of aspirations in our multi-year outlook here. So, I'm excited to talk more about that, when the time is right. Now, it'll probably be more when we're ready to announce it as a true non-pilot commercial offering. But thanks for bringing that up. Very, very excited. Okay. Operator, let's go to the phone and it's now the top of the hour, and I think this will be our last question. We said we'd keep it to the hour. So last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. That question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Hey, thanks for taking the question, two actually. So, on your postpaid net add guidance of 4 million to 4.7 million, I was hoping you can give us some thoughts around how you expect that to break out between phones and other devices? And one of the reasons I'm asking is, I'm wondering if there's any headwinds we should be anticipating? So, for example, because we might have to use a tablet net add because we did last year when there was an education surge that probably helped you out a bit. And then Mike as you said, the vast number of consumers probably don't appreciate 5G yet because they don't have it. So, my question is for Neville. Among the customers in your network who do have 5G and who access 5G, do you see evidence in their usage patterns that they actually do appreciate it, particularly when they're in the ultra-light band coverage? So, for example, are they streaming more or are they doing more 4K or are they actually using apps that maybe they don't typically use in the 4G network? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: They do speed tests a lot. That we know. But let's talk about the guidance. Peter, why don't you talk about postpaid versus postpaid phones? And I have a feeling it's going to be kind of a non-answer, but let's give it our best shot.\nPeter Osvaldik: Well, thanks for that preview, Mike and Brett for questions embedded in there. One was 2020 to 2021 and you did see us absolutely dominate in that educational arena, the public and educational space and the delivery of 2020 was amazing. And so, as we flip into 2021, that probably won't be as big of an opportunity, as we saw in 2020. And that's embedded in that guidance as well. Now regarding the breakout of phones versus others, we're not providing that breakout, but what I will say is we have a commitment as we continue to highlight of being the industry postpaid phone leader from a growth perspective. So, think about it with respect to that, that's my - Mike my non-answer, answer. So, thank you for that.\nMike Sievert: That's pretty good. All right. And Neville, you get the last word on 5G.\nNeville Ray: Super quick from me. So, Brett, yeah, we are seeing more usage on our 5G customers, and so the number is up probably early running 15% something like that, which is a great start. I'd say on top of Mike's comment, one thing that our customers do talk about when they are on our mid band 5G network, the Ultra Capacity network, they do talk about those speeds, and they're blown away, and they're excited. So, go look at our Twitter accounts and see how excited customers are by the speeds they're seeing. And we talked about speeds on that mid band layer getting to 300 megabits per second. They're pretty damn close to that now. And I'll just give you a quick shout out for Superbowl this weekend down in Tampa. We've got 80 megahertz of 5G on hundreds of mid band sites, a mix of 60 and 80 megahertz in speeds down there. And north of 500 megabits per second, on average, actually sometimes go north of 600. So yeah, folks are talking about it, they're excited about it, and usage is starting to climb.\nMike Sievert: Just one additional point we're seeing is an emerging excitement, it's always been there. But perhaps even more coming to the floor around mobile gaming. We're just hearing so much about it. I think when I talk about innovators, hardware and software developers seeing this technology and seeing business models, I think gaming is a place to keep an eye on. Definitely you're seeing video consumption, especially high-def video consumption take-up, because that's not something thanks to Ben John years ago, our customers were really habituated around. So, you see that taking up. But keep your eye on mobile gaming, I think you're going to find that 5G with its low latencies and very high capacity is something that is definitely attracting developers, which means, it's going to attract consumers. So, I think that's the show. You guys, thank you so much for tuning in again. Hopefully you can sense our excitement this business is firing on all cylinders. We appreciate you and I don't normally get to say this, we'll see you next month. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Staneff",
            "content": "Yeah, I'll take that. Thanks Mike and John. So, it's interesting you asked about 2021 and I think what the important thing to do is go maybe take a year back and look at year ago. What's interesting a year ago in Q4, you had a competitive environment. You had one competitor taking a lot of nets, one competitor taking not that many nets and we fast forward a year in Q4 and you saw them flipped. But in totality, the amount of nets being produced in the competitive environment more or less the same. And so, to what Mike's been saying what we've been saying it's what we anticipated is a robust competitive environment that's evolving and changing with certain carriers taking more or less share and that's continuing to lead growth through that as we navigate the flexible model to really lead it. The other piece of the question when you look at where we've guided in '21, what the next phase of our integration is with Sprint is really churn. It's a churn story. We've yet to start to get to work. Have really doing what we did on the T-Mobile branded business, going from worst to first on churn with our Sprint business. That's in front of us. We've gotten something taken care with the brand transition, stores and sales and gross adds and we're starting to get into the space followed by the work on the network, delivering the entire value proposition in the Sprint base and so we see that as we start to move forward. It's not going to happen overnight. So, we're really going to get to work and I feel great about our recipe to deliver great churn into this front base. So that's where you're going to see some of that as well. Yeah. Craig, that's a great question. As Mike said, we're going to dive deeper into an Analyst Day, but just a couple things, one is an overlooked part of our record results we had this year was success in business, in particular, in education and public sector. And one thing that you should know about our business, and we keep saying is we're nimble and we're flexible, and we show up and solve needs, when people have it.

It's a game changer. And it's going to be another vector for us to continue to accelerate growth going forward as we move up market into prime customers who require the best of the best network. To-date, we have not had that we're going to get that very quickly on the heels of this build. So, we see a lot of upside going forward into these areas.

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Let's start with Peter. Right. But yeah, well, let me start with that. So, let me pick up Jonathan. Well, man, I love the question, great so and before we go to 200 million this year, just got to celebrate the 100 million that we secured in 2020. 100 million, 106 million people covered with Ultra Capacity mid-band 5G. And just to do the competitive comparison that you've helped us with, it's about 50 times, 50 times the Verizon high-capacity footprint, which is pretty stunning. It's almost embarrassing when you think about it. So, love your question, because even though we have a huge lead, you're asking, can we get even further in front of our competition, and do more than we've said, we'll do it in '21. Obviously, we're going to push on every target, Jonathan. But I'll tell you this, the most exciting thing for me in '20 and Mike referenced this in his comments is the fact that we build an incredible network machine in 2020. And we have to build and upgrade a lot more sites in '21 to get to that 200 million covered people with the Ultra Capacity. So, we have the machine, we have the resources, the supply chain, the commitments, and we have the processes. And so, this machine is moving at real pace, 200 million people covered, is with Ultra Capacity is going to be a huge lead against what our competition has talked about, or said they can do. So, we'll keep pushing on it. But I'm super excited to be able to sit here with high confidence, and talk about delivering a nationwide high capacity, high, high-capacity network in the coming 11 months on top of a coverage network, which just blows the competition away. Our extended range, 5G capability there, Mike mentioned this again, more coverage on 5G than AT&T and Verizon combined. You have to let that sink in a little bit to really understand the position that we're in. And on top of that coverage layer, now we can add and pile on this mid band asset. So, tremendously excited about the progress we made in 2020, but we're just getting started on this thing. So, it's going to be a really fun year in '21. Super quick from me. So, Brett, yeah, we are seeing more usage on our 5G customers, and so the number is up probably early running 15% something like that, which is a great start. I'd say on top of Mike's comment, one thing that our customers do talk about when they are on our mid band 5G network, the Ultra Capacity network, they do talk about those speeds, and they're blown away, and they're excited. So, go look at our Twitter accounts and see how excited customers are by the speeds they're seeing. And we talked about speeds on that mid band layer getting to 300 megabits per second. They're pretty damn close to that now. And I'll just give you a quick shout out for Superbowl this weekend down in Tampa. We've got 80 megahertz of 5G on hundreds of mid band sites, a mix of 60 and 80 megahertz in speeds down there. And north of 500 megabits per second, on average, actually sometimes go north of 600. So yeah, folks are talking about it, they're excited about it, and usage is starting to climb."

            "content": "Thanks Mike. As you can tell we're fired up, we finished the year with exceptionally strong results and there is no doubt we're entering 2021 with great momentum. After writing our second half guidance on our Q3 earnings call, we executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q4, so let's jump right in. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion driven primarily by our continued growth in postpaid customers. Cost of services of $3.8 billion reflects the accelerated volume of site uprights to support the rapid deployments of our 5G network as well as over $500 million in merger related cost as we continue our network integration. SG&A expenses of $4.8 billion included over a $150 million in merger related cost as we advanced our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $750 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.60 were both better than consensus expectations and included merger related costs of $506 million or $0.40 per share in Q4 on an after-tax basis. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to over $6.7 billion ahead of our guidance and consensus expectations and included lease revenues of $1.2 billion. Our pretax merger related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA were $686 million. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.5 billion driven by our strong operating performance while cash purchases of property and equipments including satellite interest amounted to $3.8 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $583 million amounted to $476 million, an increase over Q3 even while funding our accelerated network investments. Postpaid ARPA or average revenue per accounts amounted to a $133.08 while postpaid phone ARPU was $47.86 as we continue to grow the number of customers per account and ARPU was in line with our Q2 ARPU as we had previously guided. A big shout out to our teams for great execution all around to deliver strong results in a very challenging year. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum carries into 2021 which is a peak investment year from an OpEx and EBITDA perspective while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between $4.0 million and $4.7 million reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth despite the ongoing COVID-19 impact on the switching environment. Going forward, we will focus our guidance and discussion of results on core adjusted EBITDA for improved clarity and transparency, given that we have deemphasized leasing as part of our value proposition. And I know it is how many of you look at our results since the merger already. We expect core adjusted EBITDA in 2021 to be between $22.6 billion and $23.1 billion. This is based on adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be in the range of $26.5 billion to $27.0 billion and includes leasing revenues of $3.8 billion to $4.0 billion. A strong year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA reflects the expected growth in customers and service revenue as well as an expected increase in synergies partially offset by our investments to unlock profitable growth factors and an expectation of decreased switching activity driving higher customer acquisition expenses compared to 2020. Core adjusted EBITDA for 2021 also includes the full year impact of the non-cash expense from our master lease agreement with American tower. We call, this is the straight-line accounting impact resulting from the long-term nature of the agreement, which generates cash savings from day one, while allowing for full flexibility for network deployments. Merger related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes primarily driven by network activities. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $11.7 billion and $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is expected to be in the range of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. And importantly, this figure excludes proceeds related to the beneficial interest in securitization transactions, which is expected to be approximately $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion and as classified and investing activities for accounting purposes. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting its growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, even with higher levels of investments, and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We also expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we delivered $1.3 billion in synergies in 2020 and we should expect synergies in 2021 to between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion. Breaking down 2020 we realized approximately $700 million in network synergies primarily from avoided new site builds and early decommissioning. At the same time, we realized about $600 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand, expedited retail rationalization, and move quickly to evolve our organizational structure. As we look to 2021, synergies are likely to be fairly evenly split between network related and SG&A related savings, with roughly two-thirds coming from cost reductions and roughly one-third from avoided costs that are not reflected in run rate, P&L trends, similar to 2020. Altogether, we expect 2021 to be another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock significant expansion and future free cash flow that is so exciting. And I must mention ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen the balance sheet. Last month, we issued 3 billion of unsecured notes that set a record low yields for five-year, eight year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year secured notes below 3%. We will provide updated color around synergies, mid and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business at our Analyst Day next month. And we can't wait to have a great discussion. And before we open it up for questions about our 2020 results and our 2021 guidance, just a reminder that we're currently in a quiet period for Auction 107 and will therefore not make any comments related to that. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We'll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question please? Yeah, thank you, Mike. And yeah, Phil you're a little muffled there. I think you were asking about EBITDA, as well as synergy capture, and whether both could be better is that, hopefully that's right. So, let's start with synergy. And we're [trading] [ph] $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion. Now remember, with nine months ago is when we closed this merger, and to already be delivering much faster than we anticipated $1.3 billion in 2020 alone and the guide of 2.7 to 3.0 in 2021 it's just showing actually the rapid pace of what's happening here. And if you remember, it's a multi-phased approach. And the vast majority of the synergies still come from network and decommissioning of the cell sites, some of the associated backhaul leases, et cetera. And the first step in that just to build the anchor network, and you see the rapid pace that Neville and his team are just dominating the delivery, the ramp up of the machine that's going to flow all the way through 2021. That part is what unlocks then the ongoing migration of customer traffic and customers on to the anchor network. And then of course, we can realize all those synergies on the back end. So, I've got to tell you, I'm fundamentally extremely excited about the $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in synergies for 2021 as well as the rapid pace on the network piece, which really sets us up for the back end there. In regards to EBITDA, again, let me give you a little more color. First, as you know, we were the only major carrier to show meaningful growth when comparing 2020 to proforma 2019. And our '21 guide highlights our commitment to the three priorities of profitably acquiring the competition, unlocking synergies bigger and faster, and investing in our business to set us up for the long-term growth and free cash flow generation. And the first in context is a couple of things that we want to highlight when thinking about 2020 and 2021. First, as you know, 2020, that's slightly over $500 million of COVID related costs, which were excluded from adjusted EBITDA with the majority of those now being part of the run rate of the business. 2021 also has a higher non-cash straight line lease expense associated with that agreement with American Tower, an agreement that has significant positive NPV cash savings from day one, and operational flexibility for Neville and his team to continue the rapid pace that he's deployed on. We also anticipate, as Mike said, a gradual return to higher switching in 2021, which comes with higher upfront sales expenses, of course, as the share taker in the industry, but also sets us up for that customer lifetime value benefit to the enterprise value of this business. And we're doing all of those things, and growing core EBITDA year-over-year, while we make investments in 2021, to enable their long-term success of the company. We heard about it from the network perspectives, you heard Mike talk about an enterprise as well as distribution expansion to capitalize on the network. So, if you consider all of those factors, it makes the guided core adjusted EBITDA that much more compelling, and highlights the success of a profitable growth and synergy backed model we are executing on, which is also beginning to deliver on the free cash flow unlock promise of the business, as you can see from that element of our guidance. So hopefully I captured all your questions and got that right. Yeah, thank you John. I'm not going to be able to guide to every one of those elements quantitatively but we did highlight a couple of them. Again, the $500 million of COVID related cost, vast majority of loans return to run rate of the business. And we talked a little bit about some incremental debt from the key premier connect the pledge in Q2 that was a very small component to lead so the vast majority of those target million are run rate cost in the business now. Now on American Tower, I think we talked about at least a couple hundred million drag from 2020 to 2021. But it's hard, it depends on how quickly and variability builds and what the priorities are there that could create some variability there. But that's how I think about, the least conceptually magnitude survives. And then you get into the other elements, the switching cost, the selling cost as well as the investments. And as Mike said that depends on what the environment looks like in front of us, and of course what we do every quarters, what we do best, best in the industry, we delivered profitable growth and meet or exceed our expectations that we put out therefore you and we adjust and that's what we're going to do here. But I can't breakout the individual components probably further than that for you, John. Well, let me tell you this, Jonathan. It actually isn't the first time you're hearing it. You heard me give guidance on Q3 as well and of Q2, actually second half guidance and then updated that in Q3. And look where we came in, all right, which is again, what our commitments always is, is to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver against what we put out there. But I love how you're asking me about 4.0 million to 4.7 million postpaid net add guidance next year and getting excited about it. Because what, if you look at 2020, that guy did midpoint is over twice what AT&T did in total postpaid and almost three times what Verizon did. So that's the guidance. That's the excitement here. There's a couple of factors to play out in front of us, as we said. One of those is what is that return to in the switching environment. We obviously are still impacted by COVID. And the question is, how fast does that come in? That will change the playbook for us as we said. You saw us deliver in Q3, saw us deliver in Q4, and that's our commitment in the future. But how we do it and how we go about it is in reaction to what's happening in the marketplace at the moment in time. So, look, be excited about the guide because it's an amazing guide from 4 to 4.7 on postpaid nets and similarly on adjusted EBITDA, as we talked about. Yeah, look, Jonathan. Our commitment and you saw us do it in Q2, Q3 and Q4 is again to profitably outgrow the competition and deliver on what we put out there to you. So, that's probably the philosophy but you should think of when you think of myself and Mike and how this team operates. And you saw it executed on and probably the most challenged switching environment that you could have imagined in Q2, Q3, as well as Q4 of this year. And so, I can't predict the COVID future, I wish I could get it all rid of it for all of us so that we can get out there and start living. But I can't. But I can tell you we're going to adapt and we're going to deliver. And that's the commitment to have from us. Well thanks, Mike. Yeah, and I don't want to steal all my own thunder from Analyst Day, because Craig, I want you to come and attend, so I can't do that right this moment. But I think everything that Matt and Mike talked about earlier, and what Mike just expressed now from margin perspective, is exactly that. If our plan doesn't predicate that we need to get through a Verizon level margin, and one could really question whether they will be able to maintain it when you have the combination of the premium product in the form of our network and the premium value, how they're going to be able to justify that with their customers? But that's not what we're here to do. We're here to continue to profitably outgrow, and yeah, there's some incremental costs in the short run that come with that, particularly on the sales side, as you accrue much higher terminal value for doing that. And then you did talk about some of those structural differences, which are absolutely key, and come out in CapEx versus OpEx as you see. So that's why it's so important and exciting to think about what the ultimate free cash flow generation of this business is, which really takes out some of those differentials and focuses on the cash productivity. So, really excited to highlight and update some of these figures for you next month. I'm looking forward to doing that. Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. And thank you, Mike, for the question. If I would look at it, we do provide disclosures in the fact book that attempt to do a good proforma, particularly on adjusted EBITDA, and you can look at lease revenues there as well. So, look at that in the fact book. But I would say if you add all that up, and you can do that math from fact book, core EBITDA is about $22 billion for 2020. And remember, that includes having excluded the 500 plus million of COVID costs and the benefits from a lower switcher environment that we saw in 2020. So, that's one way to look at it. And then when you put it in that context, the guide is pretty exciting as I said, that shows the significant 2020 to 2021 core EBITDA growth, despite factoring in those things like the COVID costs, the non-cash straight line lease expense, as well as the projected higher switching costs that we would see being the industry share taker, as we hoped switching picks up over the course of the year with COVID. So, that's probably where I would point you to is on the fact book, but I can tell you, if you look at it, that way, you can see the growth, even despite the investments that we're making that'll set us up for the discussion that we'll have hopefully next month. Yeah, well let me start. Absolutely on Shentel, we're certainly looking forward to taking the next steps here, finalizing the purchase agreement and getting through the close and starting to do the same network integration, customer integration as we have with Sprint, so we just see it as part of the bigger picture, very pleased that we're getting to that point. Shentel in our best estimates, is included in the guidance that we provided. Of course, you'll than see once we close some geography changes between wholesale service revenue up into our service revenue and customer geography changes which will be of course as we always are very transparent one when we close the transaction. But it is included in there, and very excited to take the next steps there and welcome those customers into the T-Mobile family. Yeah, I just repeat what Peter said, look, we're excited to get past the appraisal phase and we're absolutely looking forward to moving on with concluding a purchase and sale agreement, filing all the appropriate regulatory papers, getting regulatory approval, and we looking for hopefully looking for close sometime in Q2. Well, thanks for that preview, Mike and Brett for questions embedded in there. One was 2020 to 2021 and you did see us absolutely dominate in that educational arena, the public and educational space and the delivery of 2020 was amazing. And so, as we flip into 2021, that probably won't be as big of an opportunity, as we saw in 2020. And that's embedded in that guidance as well. Now regarding the breakout of phones versus others, we're not providing that breakout, but what I will say is we have a commitment as we continue to highlight of being the industry postpaid phone leader from a growth perspective. So, think about it with respect to that, that's my - Mike my non-answer, answer. So, thank you for that."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks Jud. Hi, everybody. We are coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington offices today, we have some amazing results to cover, and we're going to jump right in. I did plan this call to be a little bit shorter than usual to respect your time, mindful that we're going to be seeing you for a much more in-depth discussion at our Analyst Day coming up just next month, our whole team is really looking forward to being with you. But today, we are so excited to share our Q4 and full year 2020 results. And with results like these, I never get tired of hosting these calls and talking about our business because as it turns out, 2020 was T-Mobile's best year ever across our major customer and financial metrics, not just because we're bigger now after our merger, but because of how our team delivered, and we kept up this year with a very strong Q4, beating expectations and showing that we have momentum on our side. So, our business is well positioned for success in 2021 and more importantly beyond. From network to synergies, to operations and new investment areas, T-Mobile showed again this quarter that we're positioned to win. Those of you that follow us, know that we are focused on three core ambitions. First, continuing to profitably outgrow the competition. Second, delivering bigger than expected merger synergies, faster than anticipated to drive scale and enterprise value. And third, making the decisions and investments to drive the long-term growth and the exciting cash generation potential of this company. As you look at our full year and Q4 results, it's clear that we're doing exactly that. And the thesis for our company has never been more clear. We're very rapidly leaping ahead of the pack on network, with the best assets, the best team and the most loved brand in our space. If we play our cards right, T-Mobile is positioned to stay ahead in the 5G race for years to come. This quarter showcased a few key points, that are important to understand when you look at T-Mobile and when you look at the whole competitive landscape. First, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history in 2020. Finishing on top of the pack again in Q4, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, EBITDA and cash flow. Look across the major players in this industry. And you'll note that only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability. Second point, T-Mobile delivered the industry's best churn on our flagship T-Mobile brand. And we did it by delivering the best-in-class experiences across network, value and customer service. Just let that sink in for just a second, the best churn in the industry. Although we don't normally report on T-Mobile brand specific churn, I did want to make that point clear. T-Mobile went from worst to first on churn with our winning formula. And that formula is only getting better as we pull away from the pack on 5G and more customers begin to care about that. And here's the point, we know how to apply that same formula to our much higher churning Sprint branded customers, creating a big potential tailwind on future performance once this integration is substantially complete. Third key point, our growth and profitability are fueled by the rapid unlocking of synergies, which we are achieving faster than expected, as today's numbers made very clear. And finally, these synergies have helped us deliver the nation's fastest biggest and most available 5G network, which is going to inform the competitive landscape for years to come. So, let's dive into these just a little bit. As you saw in January, when we shared our early customer results, we ended 2020 as the clear growth leader in wireless, profitably taking share again, despite all the complexities of our merger. In fact, we delivered our highest ever total postpaid net adds of 5.5 million, and we grew our postpaid phone base by an estimated 2.2 million and industry best. We did all that and still delivered strong financials building upon our improved scale from the merger, with over $50 billion in service revenue growing year-over-year, when our peers were relatively flat, and growing to $24.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA. In a quarter when Verizon sacrificed growth for profitability and AT&T sacrificed profit growth for customer growth, only T-Mobile delivered customer growth and profitability growth, beating consensus on both. And with our guidance that Peter will share in a moment, it looks like only T-Mobile is expected to deliver both again, in meaningful ways again, this year. Churn, as I mentioned, we also didn't miss a beat on churn. Our total postpaid phone churn across all brands was essentially flat year-over-year for both the full year and the fourth quarter compared to standalone T-Mobile a year ago. This is including the legacy Sprint customers that were churning at over 2% this time a year ago in Q4. And as I said, postpaid phone churn for our branded T-Mobile base was the lowest of all national carriers. And a company record low for Q4, a reflection of genuine customer loyalty that's earned by giving customers the best network and the best value with great customer experiences, something that the Un-carrier is truly famous for. And as we continue to integrate, we're bringing more of that same T-Mobile experience directly to our Sprint customers. As we saw in Q4, others may try to buy customer loyalty, because they see what we see, we're pulling ahead of the pack on network, and we're about to take all their customers. But unfortunately, their results show that it's painfully expensive and ultimately just a band-aid to mask to real drivers of why customers eventually leave. The fact is there are no shortcuts to creating genuine loyalty, and sustainably low churn. And I'm confident we'll see all of this play out down the road. And while we're talking about great customer experiences, just today, J.D. Power recognized T-Mobile for the Best Customer Care in wireless for the 21st time, and the 7th time in a row. Meaning we've earned more top honors than any other wireless provider in the history of their study. As you've heard me say before, T-Mobile now has the scale and the resources to do something that's never truly been done before, offer customers the best value and the best network. Perceived network quality was the moat around the Verizon and AT&T castles that allowed them to overcharge customers for years. But T-Mobile is freeing customers across the country from having to compromise. This evolution creates a path to penetrate further into prime customers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and it creates compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. One of the reasons all of this works is that only T-Mobile is operating in a synergy backed model, which allows us to simultaneously deliver customer and profit growth, while also investing big in the business. Let me say this, our national capital plan may be ambitious, but it's known, and it's supported by our massive synergies. We'll talk about this more next month, I expect. Let's talk about those synergies for a minute. We delivered $1.3 billion in run rate synergies in 2020. That's more than we guided last quarter and well ahead of our plan. This progress includes the start of our customer migration work, something that's key to unlocking synergies, and we already have over 4 million Sprint customers moved over to the T-Mobile network. I also told you that we expected synergies in 2021 to be more than double what they were in 2020. While we still expect it to double [indiscernible], as we now expect to realize $2.7 billion to $3.0 billion in run rate synergies in 2021. These synergies allow us to make smart investments in the future. And that starts with the network. Only T-Mobile offers the fastest, biggest and most available 5G network in America. The country has never seen anything like this network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate, not just on 5G but on network performance overall. To have the best network you have to win across both coverage and capacity. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers 5G coverage across 1.6 million square miles reaching 280 million people, offering nearly 2.5 times more geographic coverage than AT&T and nearly four times that of Verizon's so called nationwide 5G. And we're also expanding our Ultra Capacity 5G at an unprecedented pace. This is where you see truly game changing speeds and capabilities enabled by the bigger channels of spectrum, found in mid band and millimeter wave. We brought Ultra Capacity 5G to 106 million people last year, 50 times more than Verizon's Ultra Wideband just crushing our goals. And now we're on to our next audacious goal to cover 200 million people nationwide by the end of this year. For a number of reasons, getting to 200 million is a much taller challenge, but we plan to the biggest network factory this country has ever seen. And we're up to the test. This is important. We're now running a huge deployment machine at pace with a proven rollout model, something that takes a long time to ramp, a process we started way back in early 2018. I expect we'll be talking more about this advantage next month also. And third parties are seeing the results. Just last week, new independent data from Open Signal was released and it's based on billions of measurements from real customers. And it proves T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G download speeds, fastest 5G upload speeds and they get a 5G signal more often than anyone else. And of course, you'll see these advantages in our marketing and messaging, including with our latest Superbowl message this weekend. Actually, I think the perception battle is the biggest one. We're all over. This team operates and executes. And our goal is to not miss opportunities. For example, we're increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprise and government, we see room to run here. We've competed mostly on price in the past if we're honest. And now we have a premium product that's increasingly the catalyst for our wins. On the consumer side, we're planning to add significantly more points of distribution and thousands of sales and service agents to reach beyond urban areas where we have historically had our big success. We have a multiyear expansion plan to bring real competition and a quality service to 50 million U.S. households in smaller markets where our market share is currently only half of what our national market share is. This is a huge opportunity to bring our Un-carrier story to more of America. And we'll soon roll out our 5G home broadband offerings to bring critical connectivity to rural parts of this country and actual competition to the cable operator. All of these opportunities are built on our game changing Ultra Capacity 5G that we are rapidly expanding across the country, further distancing ourselves from the competition every day. So, these are just a few things to whet your appetite. We'll dive deeper into each of these opportunities next month when you can hear directly from the leaders who are driving these growth areas. So hopefully, you get the idea that this team believes T-Mobile is well positioned. We will expand our front in Un-carrier strategy and capitalize on our emerging network leadership, our customer loving brand and our new scale as we tackle the challenges and opportunities that are ahead. As I said earlier, this wasn't just another great year T-Mobile. It was our best year yet, we delivered the highest postpaid customer growth in our history, while simultaneously delivering strong revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow growth. Only T-Mobile delivered significant growth in customers and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster than expected unlocking of synergies. And only T-Mobile can say that we offer the nation's fastest, biggest, and most available 5G network. And we did all this, while navigating a pandemic that made us rethink how to best serve our customers and protect our employees and in only the first nine months after the merger. Great work by an amazing team. And you know what, we're just getting started. So, let me turn it over to Peter to take us through the financials and our guidance. Peter, take it away. Hey Phil, thanks. You're a little muddled there, I think the first part of you're asking about the competitive environment and customer growth and account growth. We really like what we see. And we probably aren't surprised to hear that, because our model is proven over and over again to be flexible. And in times when there's incredibly intense competitive pressure, we find a way. And at times, when there's a more muted switching environment, we find a way. And that's what we're doing. And that's what you see in this very ambitious guide that we put in front of people today, with all the normal and usual caveats. So, we're really excited. And obviously, what we are expecting to see will be the 2021 year that hopefully transitions us back out by the end, some of the dynamics that have dominated the competitive landscape in '20 due to COVID-19, muted switching, challenged payment environments, recessionary circumstances, et cetera. We'll have to see how it goes. But the thing you should take, I think confidence in is that our plan is nimble and flexible. And we're able to call the audibles as we see them. As you saw with three quarters of very, very strong performance that we just kept off since the pandemic began. Now I think you were going to turn to Peter as well, for the second piece. I'll switch over to Peter. That's a new strategy. If you come in muddled and we can't hear you we just start talking about whatever we want to say. All right. Operator, let's go back at the queue. That sounds great. I'm going to get Peter in a minute to second to unpack that. So, Peter, think about that EBITDA question and I'm going to go straight to Matt there because I think, John this competitive environment something we really should double click into and there are some things to say about Sprint churn as a tailwind, there's also some things to say about looking at the totality of our competitive environment across Verizon and AT&T. So, Matt why don't you pick up here? It's really important to hear that message. I mean, people had said, what's going on? Isn't somebody moving? What about AT&T, aren't they producing more nets now and what you just heard from Matt is that some total of phone net adds from AT&T and Verizon was the same this past Q4 as the prior year. And so those two kinds of tend to go back and forth. And at any given quarter, there's just dynamics. AT&T is plowing a surprising amount of money, missed big on EBITDA into some short-term customer loyalty things if you want to call them that to be generous. Verizon on the other hand, they didn't spend this much, and therefore, they didn't have the same kind of nets. I don't know what they're doing. And they might have been - they might have blown all the money paying [indiscernible] to tell them they're having the 5G miss. Because it feels good for them. So, I don't know where that money went. But it wasn't being plowed to the same extent into net adds and so they beat on earnings but missed on net. So just goes back and forth. Doesn't change our game plan at all. Our game plan is to continue driving genuine loyalty as you see in our T-Mobile brand being the lowest churning brand in the industry and then reapply that same playbook on the Sprint customers. And that's just such an exciting tailwind for our business. Now before we move on, I know you asked a question about EBITDA from Peter. So, let's switch over to Peter as well. Operator, let's go back to the phones, and then I'll ask my team here for one or two that if you feel like we need to hit, it will be widely appreciated to be heard by others on the call, I will go to Twitter as well. So, take a look at those and see if you want to see one of those. Janice, I'll sign that to you, if you want. Operator? I talked about this a little bit in my remarks. But I just want to underscore how remarkable it is the rate and pace that we're operating at right now. Because it's a real competitive differentiator. And this isn't something Neville and team are, they're doing something that's never been done before operating at this scale. It was many, many thousands of sites that had to be touched and upgraded with advanced 5G technology to get us to that a 106 million, let alone the 280 million people that are covered by extended range 5G. But that's now moving to tens of thousands of sites in 2021. Tens of thousands of macro sites with Ultra Capacity 5G. It's a massive undertaking. And we started it way back in 2018, planning and citing, permitting, design, in order to create a contiguous leading network. And it's not something that can be created overnight. And as I said, it's a real advantage, I think we're going to probably have an opportunity to talk a lot more about. So, terrific. Let's go back to the phones. Yeah, sounds good. And you're right, Craig, we're going to double click into both of those, as I said in my remarks next month. And I will give Peter a chance to respond if he wants to steal his own thunder from next month. But, as we've said for a long time, we see fantastic cash production from this model at the margin rates that we already communicated we aspire to. We don't have to achieve the margin rates that Verizon has. In fact, your question is premised on the idea that they'll be able to hang on to that and that, I don't know that that's the case either. I don't know where theirs is going. I know ours is going up. And the cash production that we're able to produce in this business model with the margin rates that we've aspired to are just phenomenal and so exciting, and create a very, very valuable enterprise. And, there are differences in our model, and one of them is the internal growth rate. And so, when you think about our faster growth and the investments in present periods to get there, there will be differences between how we pursue our business plan and theirs. And it shows that we're more bullish because we have better assets and therefore are willing to invest in a longer tail and a better terminal value. And that's going to be experienced in this five-year planning horizon as one of the big differences. But, Peter, why don't we go to you and then Matt, I'll turn to you on the how are we doing on things like prime and small-town rural businesses? So, Peter, anything to add? And Matt small-town rural business? And hopefully, roger that, if I can be a little bit around your question. Can you give us more insights on consumer versus business? Businesses, both are killing it. Our big opportunity and in consumer right now, we're - that's ahead of us is small town rural, whereas I said, in my prepared remarks, we have half our national market share. And this is a huge swath of the country. So big, big potential tailwinds there. And in business, we posted double-digit growth, which, look, I mean, everybody's got a smartphone already. So, when you've got a business that's posting double-digit growth, it's because you're winning share. And as I said, in my remarks, we're winning share not just as a price cut now, please throw us a little piece so you can reply to your AT&T deal. We're winning strategic accounts, the whole account. And that's, and we're winning it based on our quality. And that's just a game changer. So very excited about what the potential could hold there. Diana Gilbert's on Twitter asks, do customers really understand the value of 5G? Or is there confusion over it? And also, she asked separately, what are the some of the use cases coming? No, they don't really yet. And it's a great question. Right now, something I think if you look at the country, something like low-double-digits of consumers with super phones have switched to 5G already that means most people it's just a twinkle in their eye. And 2021 is the year when FOMO unfolds. And you've got people, that you know who've got an incredible phone that works 10 times faster than yours. And they're able to do things with it that you can't and you start to say I need me some of that. And you start to realize that when you get it from T-Mobile, it's for real. It doesn't just work on certain street corners or when the leaves aren't out or you have a suction cup device to put in your window or whatever. It works across 200 million people, which is the goal we've articulated for this year with our highest capacity variant Ultra Capacity 5G. But to your point, it's not just going to be about smartphones, and I'm not going to get into it today. I'm sorry, it's a great question but we see lots of potential. And this is analogous to when 4G started. And we didn't see everything that would unfold in 4G with the digital lifestyles, mobile first digital lifestyles that we now lead but similarly with 5G which is an even bigger, more discontinuous innovation. We're going to see hardware and software innovations that transform how we live our lives on the go. And the question will be, what kind of a network capability will those innovators develop to? And we're convinced that it has to be a capability more like ours, that's widely available than that's available in isolated spots. And so, that's a really exciting thing that I'll get into in a little more detail another time. But thanks for those questions. And let's go back to the operator. Yeah, I'll start with the second one, and then flip over to Peter, who will probably give you at least a qualitative if not quantitative answer. You know there's so many factors into this, but I don't know Matt, do you want to jump in? Genuine customer loyalty takes time. Yeah. So proforma comparisons Peter, one of the things we said in our remarks is we're the only ones that posted genuine growth in service revenues and EBITDA. And we stand behind that, it gets a little gooey when you try and get to the math behind it, to try and unpack it for you, but it's significant growth. Peter, do you want to at least give a qualitative picture? And soon we have this problem, we'll about to start round tripping ourselves in this company which is exciting. Did you have one follow-up? Okay. Thanks then. All right, let's go back to the phone. Operator? Peter you, and as I see you're out there. Do you want to comment on the transaction? And Simon, quickly on home Internet, yeah, thanks for bringing that up. I mentioned a little bit in my remarks, we're really excited. We're in pilot phase right now. We quietly moved from LTE pilot to 5G pilot. That was an exciting milestone in this pilot. And part of what we're doing here is we're just taking our time and making sure that we put together the experience space that we need. And that means supply chain, it means customer experience, it means really being able to create a quality service. And so far, we really liking what we're seeing. So, as this network capacity starts to really hit its pace in 2021, we've got a big opportunity to get commercial and to really go out there and start attracting customers in bigger numbers. The results so far with customers we have attracted, we're delighted with and customers are too. So, that's going really, really well. This is a chance to bring real competition to this space. And our business plan relies on it, we've got a pretty significant set of aspirations in our multi-year outlook here. So, I'm excited to talk more about that, when the time is right. Now, it'll probably be more when we're ready to announce it as a true non-pilot commercial offering. But thanks for bringing that up. Very, very excited. Okay. Operator, let's go to the phone and it's now the top of the hour, and I think this will be our last question. We said we'd keep it to the hour. So last question, please. They do speed tests a lot. That we know. But let's talk about the guidance. Peter, why don't you talk about postpaid versus postpaid phones? And I have a feeling it's going to be kind of a non-answer, but let's give it our best shot. That's pretty good. All right. And Neville, you get the last word on 5G. Just one additional point we're seeing is an emerging excitement, it's always been there. But perhaps even more coming to the floor around mobile gaming. We're just hearing so much about it. I think when I talk about innovators, hardware and software developers seeing this technology and seeing business models, I think gaming is a place to keep an eye on. Definitely you're seeing video consumption, especially high-def video consumption take-up, because that's not something thanks to Ben John years ago, our customers were really habituated around. So, you see that taking up. But keep your eye on mobile gaming, I think you're going to find that 5G with its low latencies and very high capacity is something that is definitely attracting developers, which means, it's going to attract consumers. So, I think that's the show. You guys, thank you so much for tuning in again. Hopefully you can sense our excitement this business is firing on all cylinders. We appreciate you and I don't normally get to say this, we'll see you next month. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. Welcome to the T-Mobile Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Thanks for joining us for T-Mobile's third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Neville Ray, our President, Technology; Matt Staneff, our Chief Marketing Officer; and of course, Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that may include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our merger with Sprint, our business operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations webpage. I also want to remind everyone that the results prior to the second quarter of 2020 in our earnings materials represent the historical results of standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger. I would also like to note that we are currently in a quiet period for Auction 107 and we'll, therefore, be very limited in any comments that we can make related to that. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jud. Great job. Hi, everybody. Well, for obvious reasons, and hopefully, you can tell by now, we are so excited to share our Q3 results with you today. Today's report shows that T-Mobile's momentum has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter as we profitably take share and outpace the competition. We surprised the skeptics and the optimists yet again, with strong results across the board and increased our financial guidance across every metric for the balance of the year. I'm proud to say that this quarter, we delivered the biggest subscriber growth in our history, in our history, with over 2 million total net additions. This is our 23rd consecutive quarter leading the industry and this quarter, we delivered more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We've now surpassed 100 million total customers, and we're pulling further ahead of AT&T as the nation's number two wireless provider. We did all of that and delivered the strongest financials in our history. ARPU and ARPA went up from last quarter. Churn went down with the best year-over-year churn performance in our industry for postpaid phones when you look at estimated pro forma combined from last year. Our $7 billion of adjusted EBITDA beat expectations and by a lot. We delivered over $14 billion in service revenue, also beating estimates handily. And importantly, we also accelerated CapEx spending, as Neville and team are running at full speed ahead on our synergy-driven network build. Even with all of this outsized growth and accelerated network investment, we're actually increasing guidance today on operating cash flow and free cash flow for the balance of the year. Big steps forward in growth and profitability at the same time. All that is possible because these results begin to reflect the benefits of operating in a synergy-backed model, allowing us to pursue both simultaneously versus the age-old trade-off of filling after growth versus preserving margins in a given period. Our operating momentum didn't just delivered growth and profitability, it delivered amazing progress on our network. I will share more with you in a moment about all that, but the country has never seen anything like this network build, which is tracking well ahead of schedule and is clearly beginning to differentiate T-Mobile as the bona fide network leader of the 5G era. I'm just so proud of the team for being able to execute at such an incredible level in a highly competitive marketplace, while simultaneously driving integration faster and better than expected to capture our merger synergies and deliver value for both shareholders and customers. We're working hard to go big and go fast, and we expect to realize over $1.2 billion of synergies in 2020, way ahead of our plans and we're only a few months in. Breaking it down, we expect to achieve more than $600 million in network synergies, primarily from avoided site builds and early decommissioning. And at the same time, we expect to realize about $500 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand and with expedited retail rationalization. And we're now done with the initial process to evolve our organizational structure to become one team that's organized to deliver results for the business, which is expected to enable about $100 million of back office synergies this year alone. Last quarter, I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger and that continues to hold true. These early results in 2020 demonstrate our focus on lightning-fast execution. I'd also like to announce, we plan to host an Analyst Day in the first quarter shortly after we report our year-end results, where we're going to share with you more details on synergies and our outlook for the business in the next few years. And just to leave you with a little bit of a teaser, we expect synergies in 2021, including cost-avoidance synergies, to be more than double what they were in 2020. So stay tuned for more. Coming back to our strong customer results for [indiscernible]. I also want to add some important context to what we delivered. First, the industry continued to feel the impact of COVID-19 in Q3, with a much slower switching environment than a year ago. As a share-taker, that is a clear headwind to growth and yet, we still lead the industry in postpaid gross adds for phones and net adds. This is particularly exciting when you consider that we also essentially retired the Sprint brand for new customers at the beginning of August, which immediately shut off in certain flow of gross adds. So, our Q3 results reinforce this team's execution and the growing strength of the T-Mobile brand to capture what we did in the market during what I would describe as a transition quarter. We continued to see very strong growth in postpaid other devices, including continued traction in T-Mobile for Business this quarter. This reflects how we were the most responsive carrier to the needs of school districts nationwide, as they've increased availability of digital learning solutions due to the greater demand for remote learning this fall. We also saw particularly strong growth in enterprise and government and recognition of our amazing customer service just continued to roll in. For four years in a row now, businesses of all sizes have ranked the Un-carrier number one in wireless satisfaction in the annual J.D. Power US Business Wireless Satisfaction Study. We think we have about an eight or a nine share in this market among enterprises, large enterprises and governments, so that's a lot of share-taking potential. It's going well and like the saying goes, we're just getting started. Next, I want to touch on our investments to expand our 5G network leadership. As you know, we are miles ahead of the competition at the dawn of the 5G era, and we're well-positioned to stay ahead. There are really two things that matter when it comes to unlocking the potential of 5G, and I'll tell you now, T-Mobile is far and away the clear leader on VoLTE. The first one is coverage. Having reliable 5G service where you live, work and play, coverage is king. We have America's largest 5G network that covers 270 million people across 1.4 million square miles. Did you know we provide more geographic coverage right now than AT&T and Verizon combined on 5G? To be more precise, our 5G coverage is double AT&T and 3.5 times Verizon's. They claim to be nationwide, but they really only cover a fraction of the geography that T-Mobile does. Verizon is showing up late to the party by using dynamic spectrum sharing to avoid being the only carrier without \"nationwide 5G coverage when the iPhone 12 launched.\" But because they're sharing spectrum between LTE and 5G, their 5G median speeds and availability overall are the lowest of the big 3 and not much better than LTE. Well, our 5G speeds on low-band extended range 5G are twice as fast as LTE, thanks to our dedicated 600-megahertz spectrum. Okay. The second element that really matters is the high-capacity, high-speed capabilities enabled by bigger channels of spectrum found in mid-band and high-band. This ultra-high-capacity 5G is where exciting things can happen. And that's why our 2.5 gigahertz mid-band spectrum is the real Goldilocks band for 5G because it has both massive capacity and it has reach, measured in miles from our towers, not meters like the other guys. We now have 2.5 gigahertz deployed in over 400 cities and towns, covering over 30 million Americans. And we're targeting more than a 1,000 cities and towns, covering 100 million people with our mid-band high-capacity 5G coverage by year-end, that's just two months away, with plans to have nationwide 5G on 2.5 gigahertz by the end of next year. This high-capacity 5G is delivering average download speeds of around 300 megabits per second and gigabit peak speeds and that will continue to grow. For all the crowing that Verizon has done around their high-capacity solution, Ultra Wideband, one analyst recently estimated that it only covers an estimated 2 million people. This aligns with the recent Ookla report which shows that Verizon customers only connected to the Ultra Wideband 5G less than 1% of the time. Said simply, our fast 5G reaches 15 times more people than Verizon's today and could reach 50, 5-0, 50 times more people by the end of this year. Our 5G network is well ahead of the competition and it's just keeps getting better. Lastly, as you know, we're expanding our Un-carrier strategy to leverage our leading 5G network and brand and scale to capture new market opportunities, and we're doing it without losing sight of our core focus. We are continuing to expand our home Internet pilot, delivering broadband service at better prices to households across the US, with a special focus on small towns and rural America. We just expanded our pilot to parts of 450 cities and towns that were somewhat abandoned by AT&T, and we continue to lay the groundwork for our wider launch of 5G wireless broadband service for homes and businesses very soon. And lastly, we had some exciting and long-awaited news with the nationwide launch of TVision. We are all about solving pain points and serving customers, and this latest Un-carrier move showcases that yet again. While there are just so many pain points in the TV arena. Customers are so tired of being forced into contracts with exploding bundles, and massive unadvertised fees and huge overpriced packages just to get live news and sports. We're providing customers with the content and -- that they want at an incredible value, which highlights the benefits of being with T-Mobile in the first place. This is all about driving our wireless business and it serves as an important enabler for our emerging home Internet business that I just talked about, as satisfied customers rely on T-Mobile more and more for their connectivity services. So what should your main takeaways be? Just make sure you do a mute check. So, what should your main takeaways be from all of this, you guys? This was a stellar quarter, really buttressing the thesis that so many investors have about T-Mobile. We showed we can deliver incredible growth, in fact, the highest subscriber growth in our history, while simultaneously beating expectations on service revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and increasing guidance across the board, including for cash flow. Simultaneous growth and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster-than-expected unlocking of synergies, a gift which will keep giving for years to come. Far from being distracted by the merger, we're already putting the results of our integration to work as a source of strength. We did it all while pulling away from the pack on what really matters, network and the customer experience, setting the stage for T-Mobile growth leadership in this market for the duration of the 5G era. Only one company will be positioned to provide the best network and the best value in the 5G era, and that's T-Mobile. The benefits of all of that to our stakeholders, it's just an exciting story that's rapidly unfolding. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. So Peter, take it away.\nPeter Osvaldik: Thanks, Mike. As you can clearly see from our results, we delivered a quarter with record-setting customer growth while simultaneously posting strong financial results. And this profitable growth sets us up for an even stronger second half than we originally expected. So, as Mike mentioned, we're raising guidance across the board as we continue to execute on our proven playbook of delivering growth and profitability. All right. Let's go ahead and jump right into the financial details for the quarter. Total service revenue grew to $14.1 billion on continued growth in postpaid and an increase in wholesale revenues as a result of the MVNO Agreement with DISH following the sales of the Sprint prepaid customers on July 1. Recall that the revenue attributable to the Sprint prepaid customers was reflected in discontinued operations in our Q2 results and, therefore, you see a sequential increase in reported wholesale service revenue in Q3. Cost of services of $3.3 billion increased sequentially, driven by higher site cost due to the volume of upgrades we have completed, as well as higher merger-related costs, partially offset by additional synergies captured. Looking into Q4, we expect the full quarter impact of increased non-cash lease expense from a tower agreement signed in September, which will impact cost of services by approximately $150 million sequentially. Again, this is non-cash and is partially offset by continued synergy realization. SG&A expenses of $4.9 billion were down sequentially, primarily due to lower merger-related costs as much of those costs were severance and transaction-related in Q2. Additionally, we also had lower bad debt and sales expenses along with additional synergies captured in Q3. We expect seasonally higher sales costs in the fourth quarter related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment. Q3 net income of $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1 were impacted by $208 million and $0.17 of merger-related costs, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7.1 billion, which increased sequentially, primarily due to higher postpaid service and equipment revenues, partially offset by higher cost of equipment sales and cost of services. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion, which includes $379 million for merger-related costs. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $108 million, amounted to $3.2 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network and ramp network integration activities. Free cash flow was $352 million, already achieving the low end of our second half guidance even with higher capital spending. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, amounted to $133.03 and postpaid phone ARPU was $48.55. The sequential increase in postpaid phone ARPU was primarily driven by higher premium service revenues, and we expect Q4 to trend closer to Q2 levels with promotional activities. And I have to mention the ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen our balance sheet. Last month, we issued nearly $9 billion of secured notes with an average rate of 2.99% and an average tenure of 23.4 years. Collectively, since the merger closed, we have more than doubled the average maturity of our debt portfolio from 4.3 years to 9.2 years, and lowered the average cost of debt from approximately 5.7% to approximately 5.1% excluding the non-cash amortization of swaps. Okay. Let me come to our guidance, which we are raising across the board as both growth and profitability were much stronger than originally anticipated. Again, we wanted to provide this guidance and prioritize transparency even during these uncertain times. While ranges for Q4 can be inferred, we are updating our guidance in the context of our previously provided second half of 2020 outlook. We had originally guided to 1.7 million to 1.9 million postpaid net adds in the second half of 2020. Well, we checked that off the list in Q3 alone. So, in a Q4 exclusive, we're providing postpaid phone guidance. We'll look to continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth and expect postpaid phone net customer additions between 600,000 and 700,000 in the fourth quarter. Also for Q4, we expect a more balanced mix of postpaid phone and postpaid other net additions relative to the extended educational opportunities that we saw in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.7 billion for the back half of 2020, up $1 billion original second half guidance and includes leasing revenues of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. The implied Q4 guide reflects our expectations for seasonally higher costs related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment, as well as the non-cash straight-line lease expense impact from our recent tower agreement. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, are expected to be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion at the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong momentum on our network deployment. For the second half of 2020, merger-related costs, not included in adjusted EBITDA, are unchanged from our prior guidance and expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes. You will notice that this implies an increase from Q3 levels as we continue increasing momentum across operational integration activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, up from our original guidance of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. And free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, also increasing from our original guidance of $300 million to $500 million. And our effective tax rate for the second half of 2020 is now expected to be in the range of 20% to 23%. This is a lower rate than our previous guidance, primarily due to higher pre-tax book income. And as Mike mentioned, we are looking forward to an Analyst Day in Q1 following year end results to provide updated color around synergies and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business. We know this is an update you've all been waiting for and our entire team is excited to share with you all that we have going on. Okay. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask your questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Jonathan.\nJonathan Chaplin: Just a quick question on your --. Hey.\nMike Sievert: If you didn't jump in there with a question after that operator said that four times, I was just going to thank everybody and end the call.\nJonathan Chaplin: My question is about your 5G go-to-market strategy. So, I think you guys have a phenomenal advantage with 2.5 gigahertz as you articulated. And I think everybody on the call understands that advantage, and I'm wondering if the consumer market understands that -- the advantage that you have. And how you drive that message into the market over the -- as we sort of enter the 5G era post the launch of the iPhone?\nMike Sievert: Yes. So, they don't. And that's a real tailwind for investors because perception by definition lags reality. And so, to me that's a big exciting part of this story. We've done such a great job over the past seven years, eight years reinforcing with innovative breakthrough Un-carrier moves our value proposition. But to your point, we haven't trained those same engines to the same extent on our network story. And now, we have a network story, it is just phenomenal and it's about to get a lot better. As I talked about, right now we've got 30 million people with our highest-capacity, highest-speed 5G, 270 million overall with 5G, but that's going -- that 30 million is going to 100 million. At the same time, the other guys are nearly standing still on their highest-capacity 5G. It's just going to be such a stark reality that consumers are finally going to have to pay attention because millions of people are going to have one of these iPhone 12s and they're -- with T-Mobile, they're going to actually find high-capacity 5G and get hundreds of megabits per second, and their friends are going to be jealous and not only that, they're going to be seeing our story unfold on TV. As you know, synergies mean a cut in advertising and marketing, but that's versus pro forma combined. Right now our CMO, Mark Staneff, is investing more in the T-Mobile brand than ever before in our history. Even net of those synergies and those network equities, well, mostly a tailwind for investors, mostly an opportunity for improvement. We're confident in our ability to market around here, but by the way, there is already some progress. Matt, do you want to talk about how the brand is doing?\nMatt Staneff: Yes. The brand -- that's a great question, by the way. I love the fact that you're asking about how we're going to get credit for the network we have. It's such an amazing place to be in a number of years, since we've been so set up for success in the marketplace. I just want to remind you as well, sequencing is important. We're just coming off our quarter where we folded two brands into one in the postpaid market and delivered these great results. We've been hard at work at getting that right. The other thing I'll remind you was, in the early days of 5G messaging, we weren't out there bragging about something that didn't exist, right? We've been going out for a year with our nationwide 5G with extended coverage, and Neville is building a phenomenal network. So it's coming. It's coming very soon. And as Mike said, we are set up more than we ever have been to really communicate the message clearly in the marketplace, both the network we have, as well as the incredible prices and value customers get from us. We've seen great success. Early indicators are showing good progress -- very good progress in network [indiscernible]. All the leading indicators you want to see are already moving and we haven't even gotten started yet telling the story, I know you all are waiting for us to tell. I won't surprise everybody, and I'll remind you as well, we have a long legacy and history of disrupting the marketplace being innovative with our marketing, and it's coming, so stay tuned.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: Cool, Jonathan. Great to hear from you. Operator, why don't we go back to the phone for the next question?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hey. Thanks, Mike. I thought I was -- maybe missed my queue there for a minute. Maybe if you could just -- thanks for the guide, which says a lot about your view of competition in the fourth quarter, but talk more about how you see the market following some more aggressive promotions this year than last? Do you worry about the rationality of the industry from here? And then can you talk about churn as well in the Sprint customer base? What has that done versus the T-Mobile base over the last few months? And how are you doing with nailing those customers down? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet. It's great to hear from you, Phil. Yes. I -- first of all, if you look at -- and I'll ask Matt to pile in on this. If you look at the promotions in the industry, actually to us they look a lot like last year's. There's some -- obviously, some changes around the margins. Look, the phones underlying are a little bit more expensive from Apple, but generally speaking, we see a promotional environment a lot like last year's. It feels really intense but that's because it's the fourth quarter and it's because there is a big iPhone here. So, generally speaking, I don't see a trend line there that's at all concerning. As it relates to churn, now there is a trend line I'd love to talk about. We believe we have the best year-over-year churn performance in the industry by far. When you look at pro forma combined, remember this is a blended 0.9% postpaid phone churn that we delivered, last year we had 0.9% without Sprint and Sprint was churning at about 2%. So, we blended it all together and delivered that kind of performance, it shows you one thing, Sprint customers are starting to benefit very significantly from this combination. And of course, on the T-Mobile side, although we blend it and we don't disclose it separately, man, that's a great underlying performance there as well, like really good. So, we're delighted. And I have to say, even though we have the best year-over-year churn performance down to 0.9%, I also see churn as a tailwind thesis for investors because we have room to run. We delivered all of this financial performance: $7.1 billion in EBITDA, simultaneously doing that and delivering our best growth quarter in history with 2 million net new additions with that 0.9% churn that you know we've shown with our T-Mobile brand we know how to get down. So, I think it's a great potential tailwind on our story. But let's talk about promotions because I know you're not the only one that's going to want to talk about what's happening out there, and it is a bit of a misnomer, I think, what's happening. But Matt, do you want to share what you're seeing as the quarter is unfolding? I know everybody is curious about the view from the marketing seat.\nMatt Staneff: Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question, Phil. Just to reiterate on a couple of things Mike said, the iPhones -- it's a different cycle this year than it has historically been. There is a couple of things. One, it's more spread out. It's happening later in the quarter. As we all know, Q4 tends to be back-end loaded and the offers tend to get a little bit more competitive when customers show up to shop for Black Friday and to Christmas. And so, what you're seeing is a little bit of a compressed dynamics on the schedule and you're seeing the more expensive phones launch first. And we've already seen changes in the offers that were announced and have been announced. We have a new pre-order starting just even tomorrow on the iPhone. So, it's an evolving dynamic in the marketplace. But as Mike said, when you look at it apples-to-apples and you look at the true comparison of the phone and the plan and the network experience, we think, largely speaking, the offers are about the same with one caveat. There's more aggressive base offers and retention offers out there in the marketplace, and I just got to ask why is that the case when you look at the marketplace and the dynamics. We're here -- we're very positioned to succeed like we always are. And I'll just remind you again, it's -- the quarter Q4 is a bit more back-end loaded, typically speaking, versus at the early days of an iPhone launch. We're very well set up to succeed and we think we've got a very good game plan, a disciplined game plan to continue to -- our momentum and win share.\nPhil Cusick: I think the fear has been that some aggressive retention offers are --. Thank you.\nMatt Staneff: No, that's okay. Keep going.\nMike Sievert: Yes. There is a latency, but you were going to pile on a little bit.\nPhil Cusick: I was going to say the fear was that some aggressive retention offers would nail down the sort of porting opportunity in the industry and you would grow more slowly. Clearly, that's not what you see. Have you seen less sort of porting opportunity in the last couple of weeks?\nMike Sievert: Well, switching is muted. I mean, if you look across the span of Q3, as well as what's happening in Q4, switching is down. You see that because churn is down. But what Matt was just saying, I just think is important to underscore. We've seen environments like this. We've seen highly intense environments with lots of switching, and our team has got a flexible model and we find a way to post the growth and we're just really proud of that. We've been at this for a long time as a share-taker. We invest with discipline. We try not to overdo it. But in a muted switching environment, very muted, we delivered the highest growth in our history this quarter. And it really shows, I think more than anything, two things. One, how our team executes. Every company is something. Our company is great at execution. And two, that being executing against a synergy-backed model is a real benefit because we're able to unlock the value of those synergies and invest them in growth and still deliver the financial performance and period, as I said in my prepared remarks.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, again, Mike.\nMike Sievert: Cool. All right. Operator, we're on a roll. Let's just keep going to the phone. And meanwhile, I'll ask Peter to scan across Twitter and see what he sees.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Two if I could. First, maybe Mike on the new TV service. Could you just talk a little bit about the positioning of that virtual product? What do you expect it to do for your sort of economics of the business? Is if for churn reduction? Do you think it could be profitable? And then a couple of the media companies today sort of expressed some push back around the packaging and suggested that those offers may change. So if you could comment on that, that'd be great? And then, I don't know if Neville is on, but I thought the comments around synergies for next year. Based on how we had it modeled out suggests a bit of a pull-forward. It sounds like you really getting into the meat of the network integration in '21. And then if he's around, if he could talk about how that's going and how you expect that to ramp next year would be great? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. Well, we'll start with the second one on network and then circle back and I'll answer your TVision question, but you're on to a great point. I mean, this is a critical year for us in '21. You want to talk about it, Neville?\nNeville Ray: Yes. I'll cover it quickly, John. So tremendous progress. I mean, the pace and acceleration of our plans inside 2020 has been pretty remarkable. So, the start -- the main start that I'd focus on for you in terms of progress we're making on migration first, 15% of the Sprint postpaid traffic already on the T-Mobile network. So, we're building out that capacity. You heard Mike talk about all of the work we have ongoing upgrading the network. Migration is in full swing and what follows on migration, of course, is decom and synergy acceleration. So, we've already scored some decom activity inside 2020, but we will start to really ramp and accelerate that in '21 and that is ahead of our original plans. The primary kind of decom years were really '23 and '24, and you're seeing that move forward in a material way from a timeline perspective. So super, super pleased with the progress. We want to get every customer on that one final T-Mobile network with all that 5G goodness that Mike talked about. We're going to be famous for network in this Company. That's our goal and our ambition, and we want all of our customers on that network enjoying and exploring that 5G capability as fast and as soon as we can, whilst delivering on that synergy ambition and we're very confident on both fronts.\nMike Sievert: That's obviously going to be a big part of our story next time we talk when we release earnings and give you some more in-depth guidance on '21, but we're so excited about the potential because we're just way ahead of schedule. It is mostly network-driven, and Neville and team are running faster than we had expected in our model. So that's really exciting. TVision, also really exciting. We -- I'm so happy we got this out. As you know, we've been talking about TVision for a long time. We sequenced it to be sure it was here -- despite all the merger and other distractions, be sure it was here in time for our 5G broadband launch. And to your question, that's a big piece of what it's about. We're coming soon with home broadband. We're serious about home broadband. It's going to be an important way that we grow this business and make money, and you have to have the full suite of services to really be able to serve customers there. And to your question, I also think there is potential benefits on the mobile side. Customers count on us for their connectivity. They love our brand. We're able to deliver in this product a great, simple, elegant solution that we're investing in because you're a T-Mobile customer, so they get a great value and we're just smashing a bunch of the pain points in this industry and this industry is so full of them, again, as we talked about it at our launch. So, we're very excited. We're just getting started. One of the other things I've talked about for a long time is, we also intend to be a great partner to media companies and an ally because we're not a media company. We're a pure play network and connections company. And so, that's obviously got a big future for us as we -- as this world just continues to move towards an OTT future. To your very specific question, yes, we are complying with all of our media contracts and at the same time, we're working with them because we're open-minded. Some would like to see changes. And if those changes are great for customers and help us continue to smash customer pain points, we're open-minded. This is the very beginning early innings. This is a business that isn't really a business, it's an Un-carrier move, we're in it for the long haul, but we're doing it to delight customers and we're doing it to set up a home broadband business, which is going to be where a big piece of the profit pool is. Hope that clears it up.\nJohn Hodulik: Yes. That was great. Thanks, Mike and Neville.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Did you find some ones online you wanted to hit?\nPeter Osvaldik: There is a great one from Cameron Berkshire around, when will the home Internet be able to use your guy's awesome 5G network?\nMike Sievert: All right. Yes. Soon is my answer. I don't think we said, but it's coming soon. So right now, we're in a pilot. It's all 4G LTE. By the way, the 4G LTE customers love this thing. So that's really great. This is such -- as I was just saying in response to the last question, this is such an important business for us. We want to get it right. So, we've taken our time, we're piloting it, we're learning how to serve customers and delight them. But you think about the capacity of this network that Neville is building, and the fact that all of the capital for that network is paid for by the mobile business, that means we have an ability to serve customers with 5G home Internet really cost-effectively because the network is basically already built. And there are places all across this country where no normal amount of mobile usage will soak up all of that massive capacity and that's where we'll be able to offer incredible deals on 5G-powered home Internet. And you don't need a ditch dug to your house, you don't need to use old DSL copper wires, you're going to be able to experience 5G, which is many times faster than, for many people, in today's home Internet connections even in well-served neighborhoods. So, I'm really excited about it. It's coming soon. Can't tell you the date. Sorry for the non-answer. You want one more on Twitter or should we go to the phone?\nPeter Osvaldik: I think -- there's just a lot of congrats. People want some T-shirts, Mike. So we'll have to figure out how to\u2026\nMike Sievert: Yes. We'll take those great quarter guys tweet and stay long, but I think -- all right, we'll go back to the phone. So, operator, who's next?\nOperator: Next will be Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. A couple of quick questions. First, curious because you've now had the Sprint assets in your possession for, I guess, over six months now. Have you seen any opportunities to monetize some of the assets inside of Sprint that may not be core or strategic to what you're doing in the future? And then secondly, if you could talk a bit about what's happening with device leasing? In your new marketing plans how customers are responding? And your progress to moving customers over to a more traditional EIP program? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. Well, we'll start with Sprint and device leasing and everything happening with financing, I'm going to turn to Matt Staneff on that, and then we'll answer your question about the -- about Sprint assets.\nMatt Staneff: Yes, Mike, thanks for that question. So, in early August -- I think it was August 2, when we retired the Sprint brand, but what we also did is converted the value propositions in the models within the Sprint base to match that of what we're used to at T-Mobile and we're seeing great success with that, by the way. Great success with customers continuing to come in and upgrade. It's actually opened up a lot of opportunities as well in terms of access to offers and promotions, and the ability for Sprint customers to upgrade a phone when they want to and not be beholden to other issues with the legacy products. We're still using a blend as we do at T-Mobile and as we have done at T-Mobile, but the progress we're making is really good. And over time, it's going to blend and match that more closely to what we're used to on the T-Mobile side as we continue to manage the Sprint customer base and be there to serve them for and when they want to upgrade.\nMike Sievert: Okay, and great. On the other piece -- thanks, Matt. On the other piece, it's early days. I can't announce for you any great insights on that question, but I'll say two things. One, the capabilities that we inherited and that we see in this Sprint team and some of the know-how is fantastic. You really can't evaluate this team and its capabilities by the former business results of standalone Sprint. That was a company with lots of structural challenges financially. And so, it was easy to kind of side-eye that operation and assume that it didn't have much to offer. That's totally wrong. Now that we've gotten into it, there's so many best practices that we've been able to begin to adopt into the combined blended total. So that's very exciting, including the team. But to your question, there are also some businesses and capabilities. For example, a wireline capability that standalone T-Mobile never had. So we're taking a great look at that and plenty of other things. So, unfortunately, I can't sort of give you a lot of color on that process because we're looking at it, but when there are stuff to report, we'll be sure to bring it. I appreciate the question, though.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Go back to the phones.\nOperator: Next will be Walter Piecyk with LightShed.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Walt.\nWalter Piecyk: The first question I guess is for --. Hey, what's going on Mike? First question I think is for Neville, just in terms of the synergies overall. And when you're all done with this and, hopefully, it all happens sooner than later, how many of those Sprint sites will ultimately survive? And how quickly can you get that 15% in traffic up to -- I don't know, pick a number, 60%, 80%? Like what should we think about timing on that?\nMike Sievert: My favorite number is a 100%, Walt, that's the goal. So please don't reduce Neville's goals.\nWalter Piecyk: So how quickly can you get to 100%, Neville?\nNeville Ray: I can't see you but hear you. So, how have you been?\nWalter Piecyk: Good.\nNeville Ray: So, on the coverage and capacity opportunity with the Sprint sites, we are on this target to deliver about 35,000 sites that would be decommissioned over the coming years. And that would leave 12,000, 13,000 Sprint sites that we would bring into the T-Mobile network effectively for capacity and/or coverage. And we're doing a lot of work across both networks now. I don't see those numbers materially changing, Walt. The target network, obviously, we're over -- well over 100,000 sites today, but the target networks in kind of the 80,000 range, 80,000 to 85,000 sites. So, we're going to decom a bunch. We're going to add some too, right? We've still got areas where we want to add some new investment, but target range 82,000 to 83,000 sites. That's where we are today. So, very confident. We're doing a lot of work to make sure we fully understand the coverage growth and capabilities that we need to deliver along with everything obviously this 5G. In terms of the traffic number, I mean, I'm really pleased, Walt, we're six months in and we're already at 15% on that postpaid traffic base. And so, that's pretty remarkable. I didn't anticipate we'd have made that much progress in a short number of really weeks and months. So, you look at that run rate, where will we be this time next year? I hope to be in the numbers that you talk about. I'm not going to commit and say we'll get it all done in, say, 2021. It's going to run clearly into 2022. But the goal and ambition of the team here is to really drive all of this goodness on 5G and LTE capacity into the customer base of the Sprint and the T-Mobile customers in '21. And Mike talked about this huge plan and execution phase we're in to bring mid-band 5G to 200 million people in '21. And that's a massive goal, we're well on track, feel very confident about delivery on that as we'll get to 100 million this year alone. And that capacity and capability is going to be foundational to that migration opportunity. So, all things are moving very well. I'm just delighted with our progress that we've made in a short number of months, and I'm very confident in beating the targets that we put out there whenever that was, a year or so back. So things are going very well and that migration volume on traffic will continue to grow at a real pace.\nWalter Piecyk: Got it. And then just a similar -- on a similar topic\u2026\nMike Sievert: As a follow-up, we probably give you the quarter-by-quarter site count.\nWalter Piecyk: I was going to -- Mike, just follow that onto -- if it's only 15% of the traffic, but you still got the churn down to T-Mobile levels, even though there's Sprint customers in there. I mean, why is that happening? Is it just -- is customer service more important than network? Because if those Sprint customers are still 85% of their traffic or so is still on the Sprint network, like how are we supposed to think about that if we traditionally have thought about network being such an important element of churn?\nMike Sievert: Yes. I mean, obviously, both elements are important. A couple of things to unpack for you. First of all, we didn't sort of disclosed for you the T-Mobile brand versus Sprint brand. We're just putting it all in there blended. But I can tell you directionally that a big piece of the year-over-year beat isn't just the Sprint, it's over on the T-Mobile side to some just fantastic unprecedented number, so you have to factor that in. And then secondly, yes, it is the big picture. First of all, there's a lot more going on in network than just that 15%. So that's important. The network experience is improving across the board, not just by carrying some of the traffic. But secondly, it's a bigger equation than that. We're now starting to provide them with fantastic offers, we're treating them great. Do you know that we did on care NPS? Just the Net Promoter Score of the care experience, it's tripled since we -- over the past seven months. That's fantastic. The way our care team has started caring for Sprint customers the T-Mobile way and they're responding. So, the network circumstances are improving, the value is improving, the customer experience is improving, and of course, there is a lot more to it than just that 15% of carried traffic. And then over on the T-Mobile side, a big part of our year-over-year beat sits right there. Hopefully that helps.\nWalter Piecyk: Yes. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Yes. Let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I want to follow-up on a point that Mike made earlier, the yield being asked about, the iPhone promo [ph], as you said, ultimately you think that this was the lot typically you would see. And that's actually sort of remarkable because this is not a normal year. And so, the TV, the industry and to yourselves, approach the market this time of year like you normally would during the season following a device launch in a normal way is very interesting. So the question is, have consumers responded to these promos in the normal way? And you said that switching is still a bit muted, again clients are meeting it, we're not quite back to normal from the customer activity standpoint. And then just as a follow-up on that, to the extent that they are responding and increasing their engagement with you, are they doing it the old-fashioned way? Or are they walking in the stores? Or do you think that maybe you're starting to see evidence that there is a permanent shift towards digital transactions that might yield more recurring cost benefit over time? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Brett. Well, I think certainly there is more willingness from consumers, and I think that's important, because on digital, one of the things that has been so stubborn for all the carriers in the US has been that digitalization has been slow, not because we haven't invested in great capabilities. If you go to our app it's phenomenal, what you can do in it. It's because customers have been slow to adopt it in wireless, specifically. My theory is, it's because of the complexity of what we offer, and all the phone trade-ins and the financing, etc., they want to be somebody in that store to be accountable for sending them out happy. And so, that's happening. In terms of the competitive environment, I -- yes. It looks pretty much like last year to us. And with the exception of the dynamic you mentioned, centered around COVID. And overall switching is muted in Q3. It's muted in Q4. And you saw our guide, we were a little cautious just because it's -- in terms of the way our Q4 unfolds, it's early days. I know it's early November right now so you'd say we're well into the quarter, but not the way Q4 normally unfolds. It's a very holiday-centric quarter. COVID uncertainties with cases on the rise and consumer sentiment unknown, so we gave you a little bit of a cautious guide because we're watching it. But I go back to -- we've got a team that's nimble and confident, it has a great game plan and so far, consumers are responding really well to what we have to offer. So, I can't give you too much more color than that because it's a quarter that's unfolding, but to us, the overall competitive environment doesn't look materially different than last year.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for that.\nMike Sievert: You bet. All right. Let's go back to the phone. I do see a couple popping up online now. So we'll do that next. Operator?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Really appreciate it. I guess, maybe for -- this follows up on, I think, Mike some of the things you just said around the guidance for the fourth quarter. So, the implied postpaid phone additions is going to be roughly flat for the fourth quarter. The adjusted EBITDA is going to be down approximately $500 million for next quarter. Obviously, there is about $150 million of the straight-line adjustment for the tower deal you guys did. But can you kind of give us some color about what the puts and takes are about what makes that quarter happen because it sounds like it's going to be a lot better than this guide?\nMike Sievert: Well, thanks, Dave. It's great to hear from you, by the way. Glad to have you on the call. Why don't we just go straight to Peter Osvaldik for that?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Perfect. Thank you, Dave. And I'll give you a little color and then I think I'll ask Matt just to give a little bit of sense around how the quarter typically shapes up in Q4, which as he says, is relatively back-end loaded. But you're right, on adjusted EBITDA, the implied guide is down sequentially, which as I mentioned earlier, a couple of factors in there. One, you see typical seasonality, right, with the iPhone promotion cycle, with the holiday cycle that typically does show a seasonal progression from Q3 to Q4. And then as you mentioned, the other big aspect there is the non-cash straight-line lease expense of $150 million. So that's going to put pressure on Q3 to Q4. And then the other factor of this, then I'll turn it over to Matt to really talk about is, how typically Q4 shapes up, right, which is very a back-end loaded from a customer acquisition perspective. So, Matt?\nMatt Staneff: Yes. Peter and Dave, and this kind of goes back to even some of the iPhone questions we keep getting. I'll just remind everybody, we're just getting started in this. So, we're not fully through the pre-order window for the iPhones. Q4 is traditionally an often a back-end loaded quarter. There are some shifts to digital purchases from retail, and we do anticipate -- Q4 is always the heavy device buying quarter for us and some of that's been there. The entirety of the iPhone launch is in Q4. We intend, as we have shown historically, continue to lead the market. Lead the market in net add growth in the postpaid phone business and postpaid phone growth overall. So, our guide is consistent with that in terms of how we see it playing out, and we absolutely expect the competitive intensity to what I call maintain through the MPI cycle, which in prior years might have looked a little different as it builds through Q4. And so, while this one might have come off on some appearances as a stronger, our point of view is from a year-on-year when you look at the quarter as a whole, it's exactly there. And we're very well positioned to succeed in this thing, and we think we're going to see some great outcomes, especially when customers get these iPhones in their hands and see the experience that you have with the amazing network we're building.\nMike Sievert: That's great, Matt. Thanks. I'm going to go to Twitter next because there are some great questions developing. By the way, I'm so happy to see all the interest in T-Mobile for Business. Bill Ho, always great to hear from you on every report. Bill says, at T-Mobile Business has increased share, what areas have performed well? And how did the integrated Sprint legacy products and services and sales force contribute? Which verticals are offering the best traction? So that's a great question. And let's kind of also throw it -- let's do the one Roger Entner. Haven't heard from you in a while, Roger. Great to hear from you. Could you -- Roger says, at Mike Sievert, could you break down subscriber growth between consumer and business government? Also, have you started with Project 10Million? And if yes, how many households are using it now? So the short answer is, yes. Not only have we started on it but we've recrafted it. It was originally conceived as a totally free program to invest in the homework gap. What we find this year instead is a schoolwork gap. So, we added an actual paying service. Highly subsidized -- still accretive to contribute to revenues and profits, but highly subsidized to make sure that school kids can benefit from Project 10Million, even if they have increased needs versus what we originally anticipated, up to and including unlimited plans at a very attractive price. And that's actually really contributing. It was a big piece of our numbers this quarter. Our team was faster and more nimble than I think the rest of the industry at seizing a way to really meet this unmet need of public sector and school districts. So very proud of the T-Mobile for Business team. But for a little color on that, plus just how's it going, I'm going to toss outside the room. Maybe, hopefully, he's there. Let's go to Mike Katz on the phone for a little bit more on those. I see Mike. I see him starting to talk.\nMike Katz: Can you hear me?\nMike Sievert: Try it again, Mike.\nMike Katz: Can you hear me?\nMike Sievert: Yes, now we can hear you.\nMike Katz: Okay, perfect. Yes, technology. Awesome. Well, hey, thanks for the question, Bill, Roger. I'll start with Project 10Million. And like Mike said, while we announced the program going live this quarter, we really got started with it in Q2 because the demand from schools and the need to connect kids to their classroom in a fully virtual environment really just caused us to go fast. So, to date, we've worked with over 2,700 school districts across the country. Million -- many, many kids, hundreds of thousands of kids have been connected. And it's also created this really amazing opportunity for us in the public sector space, where some of the most important projects around connecting students, first for big cities, for states, they're trusting T-Mobile with those projects, which is giving us an opportunity to demonstrate both this great network we have and the way we take care of customers. And it's already translating into other commercial opportunities for us across many, many, many jurisdictions in public sector. I think, Bill, to answer your question. You remember us talking last time at this call about how we got started fast with our day one for T-Mobile for Business. And we are absolutely seeing the synergy benefits of doing that. There was this great team at Sprint. An incredible team, really [indiscernible], had a great set of relationships. And we've empowered them with a network now that is second to none, especially as we move into this 5G era. And we've really seen the benefits of bringing this team over, enabling them and unleashing them to sell the T-Mobile network, pay off for us across segments. So, whether it's small business, which is a segment that both companies -- both legacy companies had a lot of strength in. We continue to see a lot of momentum in small business, but particularly in enterprise and government, where Mike mentioned during the call is our biggest opportunity given the share that we have there, we've particularly disproportionately seen growth across those two groups and businesses are starting to see. Their testing us, they're recognizing that the network is better, they're seeing us in action and seeing the service that we can deliver. And service really matters to enterprise and government customers, and we're getting chosen more oftentimes than not when we're getting in front of customers and get the opportunity to tell our story and demonstrate our services.\nMike Sievert: Mike, congratulations to the whole TFB team for an all-time record quarter for TFB. It's just amazing. And so, yes, Project 10Million was contributing -- by the way, free product -- Project 10Million also out there in volume helping so many school kids and school districts. That, of course, is not in our numbers, none of that would be reported as a subscriber, but it's just nice to see the difference that our Company is able to make with the size and scale of this network. So, we're so proud of it. Jim Patterson online, no stranger to this Company, by the way. Great to hear from you, Jim. Jim says, at TMUS great report. How will the Company ensure an equal or greater 5G in-building experience for enterprise customers? Will T-Mobile accelerate their in-building deployments or rely on existing towers and small cells to provide coverage? I'll turn it to Neville. I'll just start by saying, first of all, remember, Jim, one of the things that makes this Company so different is that, our low-band is lower, penetrates buildings better, reaches further from towers. Our mid-band reaches miles not meters and can put very, very high-capacity experiences into buildings from the macro network. And that's a differentiator for us. So, we have less reliance on this, but it doesn't mean we're not a friend to it. We certainly are. So, Neville, do you want to talk a little bit\u2026\nNeville Ray: Yes, super quick. Good to see you online, Jim. For sure, right? I mean, a big, big part of this 5G experience is in-buildings, not just for enterprise but for consumer. And you heard Mike outlined there how our low-band position that 600-megahertz spectrum really sets us up. I mean, we've got follow spectrum, which we were able to commit to 5G in good volumes and that's really making a difference for all customer experience. But absolutely, we have to do more on the enterprise space. There are tough environments, which we know you have to go after from the inside-out. So, yes, we are ramping that activity, a lot of activity in collaboration ongoing with Mike Katz, who was just on, with Mike's team. We're looking at all the solutions. Those traditional DAS, I'm super interested in applying millimeter wave spectrum. We have a lot of that and we're going to look to use that in-building. And quite frankly, I mean, that's a great opportunity for millimeter wave. Poor old Verizon is out there trying to build an on-street network with millimeter wave and the performance is just quite, frankly, nimble as Mike outlined in the opening comments. We're going to make sure that outdoor experiences is there from deep spectrum on macro sites and small cells and we'll use millimeter wave where it makes sense. And one of those environments is going to be in-buildings and that's a great way for us to attack 5G experience indoors, especially for the enterprise.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. I was nice about it, though. If you give Neville enough time, he'll slay the competition. So, I know we're out of scheduled time, but we'll do two more if we hold ourselves to try and be brief because I want to make sure that we're hitting enough of the people on the phone. So operator, let's go to the phone and we'll do our final two questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. I wonder maybe we could stay with the Business services conversation that you were just having. You talked about being in the sales process and getting in front of customers. How much of the sales process decision-making among, particularly enterprise and government customers, is already based on expectations around 5G? And what are the applications, and is it latency or IoT? What are the applications in 5G that you see starting to drive decision-making in the enterprise market?\nMike Sievert: Yes. Craig, I'll be brief on this one instead of tossing it out. The answer is yes, but it's not necessarily yet at scale driving our business centered around new applications. That's common. What's driving our business right now is reliable, high-capacity network leadership on smartphone. And there are plenty of other things that we're working with customers on. But if you're asking what's contributing to our results in getting us in the door, it's that unlike consumers -- and this is really interesting because it goes to the premise that we -- I think the very first question was consumer perception of our network. Unlike consumers, businesses test this stuff. They'll check out 100 phones and run them through the ringer for six weeks and then decide. And you know what? When they do that we're winning, especially to the premise of your question, when the question is, who's got the best 5G coverage and capacity and experience? Because it's just -- it's not even close right now and they know it we're pulling further away from the pack. Businesses want their employees connected right now more than they ever have. They need that connection to be reliable and they need it right now especially to be high-capacity and that's what we're able to offer. So, as we just said, Mike and team just posted the biggest quarter in our history for TFB. We're so proud of them, but this is really more than anything a story about network leadership, we've kind of caught up on LTE. But the real story is how far ahead we are for -- on 5G and how well positioned we are, to the premise of your question, Craig, to stay ahead for the duration of the 5G era.\nCraig Moffett: And so, are customers looking out and I'm really pre-planning for 2023 and '24 when my enterprise is going to need these services and I want to be on the T-Mobile network now in preparation?\nMike Sievert: I don't think that's what's driving our business. Yes, of course, they are doing that and with time frame sooner than that. But right now what's driving our business is the dynamic I talked about. And so, a lot of that can be additive when it comes to the low-latency, high-capacity experiences, network as a service for enterprises, automation services, all the things -- augmented reality, virtual reality, all the things that we can deliver with a high-capacity, low-latency network, most of those things are still in our future as it relates to how they can contribute to growth. What's contributing right now is that, they understand our story that we're out in front, and we're going to stay out in front. And I think that's a lot of comfort to somebody picking a partner in the 5G space.\nCraig Moffett: That's great. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great to hear from you. Let's go to what I think is going to be our last question, right? Because the time frame, I want to be respectful we said 2:30. So, operator, let's go to the last question.\nOperator: And that question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Mike, great results, but the whole industry had some pretty robust subscriber numbers both on the postpaid side and on the prepaid side, which was impressive given that there wasn't really a new iPhone cycle in Q3. So, any sense on the sustainability of this and what you see? Is it more second devices? Is it more younger people, etc., maybe using some of the money they are not spending on other things in this environment? So any color there would be great. And any update on the Shenandoah negotiations next steps and timing on that? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. Well, on the first one, you have to look underneath everybody's report. When you look underneath ours, you saw postpaid phones again leading the industry very strong performance on the centerpiece that we've always focused on. The prepaid leader, T-Mobile continuing to grow from a leadership position, which is not something you've been able to see postpaid leaders do reliably in the past, so that's great. And then you saw our great outsized performance on postpaid other, driven by a number of different dynamics, including those dynamics you talked about. People adding to their relationships with us, but also new opportunities in TFB, we spent some time on the call talking about. So that's what happens when you double click into ours. When you double click into our competitors, there are some gymnastics. A lot of the big numbers have to do with like reversing accruals from previous quarters that were too conservative, or strange things in the prepaid space having to do with connected cars and accrual reversals that when you really look underneath it, I don't think cricket's crowing at all. In fact, I think they reduced. So, you really have to look through the reports right now because COVID made things so difficult. What you get from us is transparency, lots and lots of it, you got to work a little harder to get underneath the reports of our competitors. But I think you're seeing because of this public sector the dynamic, you're also seeing some terrific category growth. And then you asked about Shentel, so do we want to say anything, give an update on how that's [indiscernible] we can't, right? Yes. I hate to end on no, we have no response. But we're following a process. The original agreement is that we had with a couple of these partners called for us to have the rights to buy and there is a prescribed process on valuation and we're following that process and we just don't have anything to report. So, I'm ending this call on a no comment. That's great. Listen, you guys, thank you for you're in. We're so proud of the results that the Company was able to post. Really look forward to talking to you again when we report the full-year and double clicking with a longer conversation with our 2021 Analyst Day, so stay tuned for all that. Thanks, everybody.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. Thank you everyone for tuning in. Operator, go ahead and close the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. third quarter 2020 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay, perfect. Yes, technology. Awesome. Well, hey, thanks for the question, Bill, Roger. I'll start with Project 10Million. And like Mike said, while we announced the program going live this quarter, we really got started with it in Q2 because the demand from schools and the need to connect kids to their classroom in a fully virtual environment really just caused us to go fast. So, to date, we've worked with over 2,700 school districts across the country. Million -- many, many kids, hundreds of thousands of kids have been connected. And it's also created this really amazing opportunity for us in the public sector space, where some of the most important projects around connecting students, first for big cities, for states, they're trusting T-Mobile with those projects, which is giving us an opportunity to demonstrate both this great network we have and the way we take care of customers. And it's already translating into other commercial opportunities for us across many, many, many jurisdictions in public sector. I think, Bill, to answer your question. You remember us talking last time at this call about how we got started fast with our day one for T-Mobile for Business. And we are absolutely seeing the synergy benefits of doing that. There was this great team at Sprint. An incredible team, really [indiscernible], had a great set of relationships. And we've empowered them with a network now that is second to none, especially as we move into this 5G era. And we've really seen the benefits of bringing this team over, enabling them and unleashing them to sell the T-Mobile network, pay off for us across segments. So, whether it's small business, which is a segment that both companies -- both legacy companies had a lot of strength in. We continue to see a lot of momentum in small business, but particularly in enterprise and government, where Mike mentioned during the call is our biggest opportunity given the share that we have there, we've particularly disproportionately seen growth across those two groups and businesses are starting to see.

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes. I'll cover it quickly, John. So tremendous progress. I mean, the pace and acceleration of our plans inside 2020 has been pretty remarkable. So, the start -- the main start that I'd focus on for you in terms of progress we're making on migration first, 15% of the Sprint postpaid traffic already on the T-Mobile network. So, we're building out that capacity. You heard Mike talk about all of the work we have ongoing upgrading the network. Migration is in full swing and what follows on migration, of course, is decom and synergy acceleration. So, we've already scored some decom activity inside 2020, but we will start to really ramp and accelerate that in '21 and that is ahead of our original plans. The primary kind of decom years were really '23 and '24, and you're seeing that move forward in a material way from a timeline perspective. So super, super pleased with the progress. We want to get every customer on that one final T-Mobile network with all that 5G goodness that Mike talked about. We're going to be famous for network in this Company. That's our goal and our ambition, and we want all of our customers on that network enjoying and exploring that 5G capability as fast and as soon as we can, whilst delivering on that synergy ambition and we're very confident on both fronts. I can't see you but hear you. So, how have you been? So, on the coverage and capacity opportunity with the Sprint sites, we are on this target to deliver about 35,000 sites that would be decommissioned over the coming years. And that would leave 12,000, 13,000 Sprint sites that we would bring into the T-Mobile network effectively for capacity and/or coverage. And we're doing a lot of work across both networks now. I don't see those numbers materially changing, Walt. The target network, obviously, we're over -- well over 100,000 sites today, but the target networks in kind of the 80,000 range, 80,000 to 85,000 sites. So, we're going to decom a bunch. We're going to add some too, right? We've still got areas where we want to add some new investment, but target range 82,000 to 83,000 sites. That's where we are today. So, very confident. We're doing a lot of work to make sure we fully understand the coverage growth and capabilities that we need to deliver along with everything obviously this 5G. In terms of the traffic number, I mean, I'm really pleased, Walt, we're six months in and we're already at 15% on that postpaid traffic base. And so, that's pretty remarkable. I didn't anticipate we'd have made that much progress in a short number of really weeks and months. So, you look at that run rate, where will we be this time next year? I hope to be in the numbers that you talk about. I'm not going to commit and say we'll get it all done in, say, 2021. It's going to run clearly into 2022. But the goal and ambition of the team here is to really drive all of this goodness on 5G and LTE capacity into the customer base of the Sprint and the T-Mobile customers in '21. And Mike talked about this huge plan and execution phase we're in to bring mid-band 5G to 200 million people in '21. And that's a massive goal, we're well on track, feel very confident about delivery on that as we'll get to 100 million this year alone. And that capacity and capability is going to be foundational to that migration opportunity. So, all things are moving very well. I'm just delighted with our progress that we've made in a short number of months, and I'm very confident in beating the targets that we put out there whenever that was, a year or so back. So things are going very well and that migration volume on traffic will continue to grow at a real pace. Yes, super quick. Good to see you online, Jim. For sure, right? I mean, a big, big part of this 5G experience is in-buildings, not just for enterprise but for consumer. And you heard Mike outlined there how our low-band position that 600-megahertz spectrum really sets us up. I mean, we've got follow spectrum, which we were able to commit to 5G in good volumes and that's really making a difference for all customer experience.

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. As you can clearly see from our results, we delivered a quarter with record-setting customer growth while simultaneously posting strong financial results. And this profitable growth sets us up for an even stronger second half than we originally expected. So, as Mike mentioned, we're raising guidance across the board as we continue to execute on our proven playbook of delivering growth and profitability. All right. Let's go ahead and jump right into the financial details for the quarter. Total service revenue grew to $14.1 billion on continued growth in postpaid and an increase in wholesale revenues as a result of the MVNO Agreement with DISH following the sales of the Sprint prepaid customers on July 1. Recall that the revenue attributable to the Sprint prepaid customers was reflected in discontinued operations in our Q2 results and, therefore, you see a sequential increase in reported wholesale service revenue in Q3. Cost of services of $3.3 billion increased sequentially, driven by higher site cost due to the volume of upgrades we have completed, as well as higher merger-related costs, partially offset by additional synergies captured. Looking into Q4, we expect the full quarter impact of increased non-cash lease expense from a tower agreement signed in September, which will impact cost of services by approximately $150 million sequentially. Again, this is non-cash and is partially offset by continued synergy realization. SG&A expenses of $4.9 billion were down sequentially, primarily due to lower merger-related costs as much of those costs were severance and transaction-related in Q2. Additionally, we also had lower bad debt and sales expenses along with additional synergies captured in Q3. We expect seasonally higher sales costs in the fourth quarter related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment. Q3 net income of $1.3 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1 were impacted by $208 million and $0.17 of merger-related costs, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7.1 billion, which increased sequentially, primarily due to higher postpaid service and equipment revenues, partially offset by higher cost of equipment sales and cost of services. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $2.8 billion, which includes $379 million for merger-related costs. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $108 million, amounted to $3.2 billion as we accelerated the build-out of our nationwide 5G network and ramp network integration activities. Free cash flow was $352 million, already achieving the low end of our second half guidance even with higher capital spending. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, amounted to $133.03 and postpaid phone ARPU was $48.55. The sequential increase in postpaid phone ARPU was primarily driven by higher premium service revenues, and we expect Q4 to trend closer to Q2 levels with promotional activities. And I have to mention the ongoing work done to significantly improve our capital structure and strengthen our balance sheet. Last month, we issued nearly $9 billion of secured notes with an average rate of 2.99% and an average tenure of 23.4 years. Collectively, since the merger closed, we have more than doubled the average maturity of our debt portfolio from 4.3 years to 9.2 years, and lowered the average cost of debt from approximately 5.7% to approximately 5.1% excluding the non-cash amortization of swaps. Okay. Let me come to our guidance, which we are raising across the board as both growth and profitability were much stronger than originally anticipated. Again, we wanted to provide this guidance and prioritize transparency even during these uncertain times. While ranges for Q4 can be inferred, we are updating our guidance in the context of our previously provided second half of 2020 outlook. We had originally guided to 1.7 million to 1.9 million postpaid net adds in the second half of 2020. Well, we checked that off the list in Q3 alone. So, in a Q4 exclusive, we're providing postpaid phone guidance. We'll look to continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth and expect postpaid phone net customer additions between 600,000 and 700,000 in the fourth quarter. Also for Q4, we expect a more balanced mix of postpaid phone and postpaid other net additions relative to the extended educational opportunities that we saw in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.7 billion for the back half of 2020, up $1 billion original second half guidance and includes leasing revenues of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. The implied Q4 guide reflects our expectations for seasonally higher costs related to the iPhone launch and holiday promotional environment, as well as the non-cash straight-line lease expense impact from our recent tower agreement. Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, are expected to be between $6.7 billion and $6.9 billion at the high end of our prior guidance, driven by strong momentum on our network deployment. For the second half of 2020, merger-related costs, not included in adjusted EBITDA, are unchanged from our prior guidance and expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes. You will notice that this implies an increase from Q3 levels as we continue increasing momentum across operational integration activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, up from our original guidance of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion. And free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $900 million, also increasing from our original guidance of $300 million to $500 million. And our effective tax rate for the second half of 2020 is now expected to be in the range of 20% to 23%. This is a lower rate than our previous guidance, primarily due to higher pre-tax book income. And as Mike mentioned, we are looking forward to an Analyst Day in Q1 following year end results to provide updated color around synergies and long-term guidance, as well as a strategic overview of the business. We know this is an update you've all been waiting for and our entire team is excited to share with you all that we have going on. Okay. Now, let's get to your questions. You can ask your questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. There is a great one from Cameron Berkshire around, when will the home Internet be able to use your guy's awesome 5G network? I think -- there's just a lot of congrats. People want some T-shirts, Mike. So we'll have to figure out how to... Yes. Perfect. Thank you, Dave. And I'll give you a little color and then I think I'll ask Matt just to give a little bit of sense around how the quarter typically shapes up in Q4, which as he says, is relatively back-end loaded. But you're right, on adjusted EBITDA, the implied guide is down sequentially, which as I mentioned earlier, a couple of factors in there. One, you see typical seasonality, right, with the iPhone promotion cycle, with the holiday cycle that typically does show a seasonal progression from Q3 to Q4. And then as you mentioned, the other big aspect there is the non-cash straight-line lease expense of $150 million. So that's going to put pressure on Q3 to Q4. And then the other factor of this, then I'll turn it over to Matt to really talk about is, how typically Q4 shapes up, right, which is very a back-end loaded from a customer acquisition perspective. So, Matt? Absolutely. Thank you everyone for tuning in. Operator, go ahead and close the call."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks, Jud. Great job. Hi, everybody. Well, for obvious reasons, and hopefully, you can tell by now, we are so excited to share our Q3 results with you today. Today's report shows that T-Mobile's momentum has continued to accelerate quarter after quarter as we profitably take share and outpace the competition. We surprised the skeptics and the optimists yet again, with strong results across the board and increased our financial guidance across every metric for the balance of the year. I'm proud to say that this quarter, we delivered the biggest subscriber growth in our history, in our history, with over 2 million total net additions. This is our 23rd consecutive quarter leading the industry and this quarter, we delivered more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We've now surpassed 100 million total customers, and we're pulling further ahead of AT&T as the nation's number two wireless provider. We did all of that and delivered the strongest financials in our history. ARPU and ARPA went up from last quarter. Churn went down with the best year-over-year churn performance in our industry for postpaid phones when you look at estimated pro forma combined from last year. Our $7 billion of adjusted EBITDA beat expectations and by a lot. We delivered over $14 billion in service revenue, also beating estimates handily. And importantly, we also accelerated CapEx spending, as Neville and team are running at full speed ahead on our synergy-driven network build. Even with all of this outsized growth and accelerated network investment, we're actually increasing guidance today on operating cash flow and free cash flow for the balance of the year. Big steps forward in growth and profitability at the same time. All that is possible because these results begin to reflect the benefits of operating in a synergy-backed model, allowing us to pursue both simultaneously versus the age-old trade-off of filling after growth versus preserving margins in a given period. Our operating momentum didn't just delivered growth and profitability, it delivered amazing progress on our network. I will share more with you in a moment about all that, but the country has never seen anything like this network build, which is tracking well ahead of schedule and is clearly beginning to differentiate T-Mobile as the bona fide network leader of the 5G era. I'm just so proud of the team for being able to execute at such an incredible level in a highly competitive marketplace, while simultaneously driving integration faster and better than expected to capture our merger synergies and deliver value for both shareholders and customers. We're working hard to go big and go fast, and we expect to realize over $1.2 billion of synergies in 2020, way ahead of our plans and we're only a few months in. Breaking it down, we expect to achieve more than $600 million in network synergies, primarily from avoided site builds and early decommissioning. And at the same time, we expect to realize about $500 million from streamline marketing efforts under one flagship brand and with expedited retail rationalization. And we're now done with the initial process to evolve our organizational structure to become one team that's organized to deliver results for the business, which is expected to enable about $100 million of back office synergies this year alone. Last quarter, I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger and that continues to hold true. These early results in 2020 demonstrate our focus on lightning-fast execution. I'd also like to announce, we plan to host an Analyst Day in the first quarter shortly after we report our year-end results, where we're going to share with you more details on synergies and our outlook for the business in the next few years. And just to leave you with a little bit of a teaser, we expect synergies in 2021, including cost-avoidance synergies, to be more than double what they were in 2020. So stay tuned for more. Coming back to our strong customer results for [indiscernible]. I also want to add some important context to what we delivered. First, the industry continued to feel the impact of COVID-19 in Q3, with a much slower switching environment than a year ago. As a share-taker, that is a clear headwind to growth and yet, we still lead the industry in postpaid gross adds for phones and net adds. This is particularly exciting when you consider that we also essentially retired the Sprint brand for new customers at the beginning of August, which immediately shut off in certain flow of gross adds. So, our Q3 results reinforce this team's execution and the growing strength of the T-Mobile brand to capture what we did in the market during what I would describe as a transition quarter. We continued to see very strong growth in postpaid other devices, including continued traction in T-Mobile for Business this quarter. This reflects how we were the most responsive carrier to the needs of school districts nationwide, as they've increased availability of digital learning solutions due to the greater demand for remote learning this fall. We also saw particularly strong growth in enterprise and government and recognition of our amazing customer service just continued to roll in. For four years in a row now, businesses of all sizes have ranked the Un-carrier number one in wireless satisfaction in the annual J.D. Power US Business Wireless Satisfaction Study. We think we have about an eight or a nine share in this market among enterprises, large enterprises and governments, so that's a lot of share-taking potential. It's going well and like the saying goes, we're just getting started. Next, I want to touch on our investments to expand our 5G network leadership. As you know, we are miles ahead of the competition at the dawn of the 5G era, and we're well-positioned to stay ahead. There are really two things that matter when it comes to unlocking the potential of 5G, and I'll tell you now, T-Mobile is far and away the clear leader on VoLTE. The first one is coverage. Having reliable 5G service where you live, work and play, coverage is king. We have America's largest 5G network that covers 270 million people across 1.4 million square miles. Did you know we provide more geographic coverage right now than AT&T and Verizon combined on 5G? To be more precise, our 5G coverage is double AT&T and 3.5 times Verizon's. They claim to be nationwide, but they really only cover a fraction of the geography that T-Mobile does. Verizon is showing up late to the party by using dynamic spectrum sharing to avoid being the only carrier without \"nationwide 5G coverage when the iPhone 12 launched.\" But because they're sharing spectrum between LTE and 5G, their 5G median speeds and availability overall are the lowest of the big 3 and not much better than LTE. Well, our 5G speeds on low-band extended range 5G are twice as fast as LTE, thanks to our dedicated 600-megahertz spectrum. Okay. The second element that really matters is the high-capacity, high-speed capabilities enabled by bigger channels of spectrum found in mid-band and high-band. This ultra-high-capacity 5G is where exciting things can happen. And that's why our 2.5 gigahertz mid-band spectrum is the real Goldilocks band for 5G because it has both massive capacity and it has reach, measured in miles from our towers, not meters like the other guys. We now have 2.5 gigahertz deployed in over 400 cities and towns, covering over 30 million Americans. And we're targeting more than a 1,000 cities and towns, covering 100 million people with our mid-band high-capacity 5G coverage by year-end, that's just two months away, with plans to have nationwide 5G on 2.5 gigahertz by the end of next year. This high-capacity 5G is delivering average download speeds of around 300 megabits per second and gigabit peak speeds and that will continue to grow. For all the crowing that Verizon has done around their high-capacity solution, Ultra Wideband, one analyst recently estimated that it only covers an estimated 2 million people. This aligns with the recent Ookla report which shows that Verizon customers only connected to the Ultra Wideband 5G less than 1% of the time. Said simply, our fast 5G reaches 15 times more people than Verizon's today and could reach 50, 5-0, 50 times more people by the end of this year. Our 5G network is well ahead of the competition and it's just keeps getting better. Lastly, as you know, we're expanding our Un-carrier strategy to leverage our leading 5G network and brand and scale to capture new market opportunities, and we're doing it without losing sight of our core focus. We are continuing to expand our home Internet pilot, delivering broadband service at better prices to households across the US, with a special focus on small towns and rural America. We just expanded our pilot to parts of 450 cities and towns that were somewhat abandoned by AT&T, and we continue to lay the groundwork for our wider launch of 5G wireless broadband service for homes and businesses very soon. And lastly, we had some exciting and long-awaited news with the nationwide launch of TVision. We are all about solving pain points and serving customers, and this latest Un-carrier move showcases that yet again. While there are just so many pain points in the TV arena. Customers are so tired of being forced into contracts with exploding bundles, and massive unadvertised fees and huge overpriced packages just to get live news and sports. We're providing customers with the content and -- that they want at an incredible value, which highlights the benefits of being with T-Mobile in the first place. This is all about driving our wireless business and it serves as an important enabler for our emerging home Internet business that I just talked about, as satisfied customers rely on T-Mobile more and more for their connectivity services. So what should your main takeaways be? Just make sure you do a mute check. So, what should your main takeaways be from all of this, you guys? This was a stellar quarter, really buttressing the thesis that so many investors have about T-Mobile. We showed we can deliver incredible growth, in fact, the highest subscriber growth in our history, while simultaneously beating expectations on service revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and increasing guidance across the board, including for cash flow. Simultaneous growth and profitability, fueled by the rapid and faster-than-expected unlocking of synergies, a gift which will keep giving for years to come. Far from being distracted by the merger, we're already putting the results of our integration to work as a source of strength. We did it all while pulling away from the pack on what really matters, network and the customer experience, setting the stage for T-Mobile growth leadership in this market for the duration of the 5G era. Only one company will be positioned to provide the best network and the best value in the 5G era, and that's T-Mobile. The benefits of all of that to our stakeholders, it's just an exciting story that's rapidly unfolding. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. So Peter, take it away. Hey, Jonathan. If you didn't jump in there with a question after that operator said that four times, I was just going to thank everybody and end the call. Yes. So, they don't. And that's a real tailwind for investors because perception by definition lags reality. And so, to me that's a big exciting part of this story. We've done such a great job over the past seven years, eight years reinforcing with innovative breakthrough Un-carrier moves our value proposition. But to your point, we haven't trained those same engines to the same extent on our network story. And now, we have a network story, it is just phenomenal and it's about to get a lot better. As I talked about, right now we've got 30 million people with our highest-capacity, highest-speed 5G, 270 million overall with 5G, but that's going -- that 30 million is going to 100 million. At the same time, the other guys are nearly standing still on their highest-capacity 5G. It's just going to be such a stark reality that consumers are finally going to have to pay attention because millions of people are going to have one of these iPhone 12s and they're -- with T-Mobile, they're going to actually find high-capacity 5G and get hundreds of megabits per second, and their friends are going to be jealous and not only that, they're going to be seeing our story unfold on TV. As you know, synergies mean a cut in advertising and marketing, but that's versus pro forma combined. Right now our CMO, Mark Staneff, is investing more in the T-Mobile brand than ever before in our history. Even net of those synergies and those network equities, well, mostly a tailwind for investors, mostly an opportunity for improvement. We're confident in our ability to market around here, but by the way, there is already some progress. Matt, do you want to talk about how the brand is doing? Cool, Jonathan. Great to hear from you. Operator, why don't we go back to the phone for the next question? You bet. It's great to hear from you, Phil. Yes. I -- first of all, if you look at -- and I'll ask Matt to pile in on this. If you look at the promotions in the industry, actually to us they look a lot like last year's. There's some -- obviously, some changes around the margins. Look, the phones underlying are a little bit more expensive from Apple, but generally speaking, we see a promotional environment a lot like last year's. It feels really intense but that's because it's the fourth quarter and it's because there is a big iPhone here. So, generally speaking, I don't see a trend line there that's at all concerning. As it relates to churn, now there is a trend line I'd love to talk about. We believe we have the best year-over-year churn performance in the industry by far. When you look at pro forma combined, remember this is a blended 0.9% postpaid phone churn that we delivered, last year we had 0.9% without Sprint and Sprint was churning at about 2%. So, we blended it all together and delivered that kind of performance, it shows you one thing, Sprint customers are starting to benefit very significantly from this combination. And of course, on the T-Mobile side, although we blend it and we don't disclose it separately, man, that's a great underlying performance there as well, like really good. So, we're delighted. And I have to say, even though we have the best year-over-year churn performance down to 0.9%, I also see churn as a tailwind thesis for investors because we have room to run. We delivered all of this financial performance: $7.1 billion in EBITDA, simultaneously doing that and delivering our best growth quarter in history with 2 million net new additions with that 0.9% churn that you know we've shown with our T-Mobile brand we know how to get down. So, I think it's a great potential tailwind on our story. But let's talk about promotions because I know you're not the only one that's going to want to talk about what's happening out there, and it is a bit of a misnomer, I think, what's happening. But Matt, do you want to share what you're seeing as the quarter is unfolding? I know everybody is curious about the view from the marketing seat. Yes. There is a latency, but you were going to pile on a little bit. Well, switching is muted. I mean, if you look across the span of Q3, as well as what's happening in Q4, switching is down. You see that because churn is down. But what Matt was just saying, I just think is important to underscore. We've seen environments like this. We've seen highly intense environments with lots of switching, and our team has got a flexible model and we find a way to post the growth and we're just really proud of that. We've been at this for a long time as a share-taker. We invest with discipline. We try not to overdo it. But in a muted switching environment, very muted, we delivered the highest growth in our history this quarter. And it really shows, I think more than anything, two things. One, how our team executes. Every company is something. Our company is great at execution. And two, that being executing against a synergy-backed model is a real benefit because we're able to unlock the value of those synergies and invest them in growth and still deliver the financial performance and period, as I said in my prepared remarks. Cool. All right. Operator, we're on a roll. Let's just keep going to the phone. And meanwhile, I'll ask Peter to scan across Twitter and see what he sees. Sounds great. Well, we'll start with the second one on network and then circle back and I'll answer your TVision question, but you're on to a great point. I mean, this is a critical year for us in '21. You want to talk about it, Neville? That's obviously going to be a big part of our story next time we talk when we release earnings and give you some more in-depth guidance on '21, but we're so excited about the potential because we're just way ahead of schedule. It is mostly network-driven, and Neville and team are running faster than we had expected in our model. So that's really exciting. TVision, also really exciting. We -- I'm so happy we got this out. As you know, we've been talking about TVision for a long time. We sequenced it to be sure it was here -- despite all the merger and other distractions, be sure it was here in time for our 5G broadband launch. And to your question, that's a big piece of what it's about. We're coming soon with home broadband. We're serious about home broadband. It's going to be an important way that we grow this business and make money, and you have to have the full suite of services to really be able to serve customers there. And to your question, I also think there is potential benefits on the mobile side. Customers count on us for their connectivity. They love our brand. We're able to deliver in this product a great, simple, elegant solution that we're investing in because you're a T-Mobile customer, so they get a great value and we're just smashing a bunch of the pain points in this industry and this industry is so full of them, again, as we talked about it at our launch. So, we're very excited. We're just getting started. One of the other things I've talked about for a long time is, we also intend to be a great partner to media companies and an ally because we're not a media company. We're a pure play network and connections company. And so, that's obviously got a big future for us as we -- as this world just continues to move towards an OTT future. To your very specific question, yes, we are complying with all of our media contracts and at the same time, we're working with them because we're open-minded. Some would like to see changes. And if those changes are great for customers and help us continue to smash customer pain points, we're open-minded. This is the very beginning early innings. This is a business that isn't really a business, it's an Un-carrier move, we're in it for the long haul, but we're doing it to delight customers and we're doing it to set up a home broadband business, which is going to be where a big piece of the profit pool is. Hope that clears it up. You bet. Did you find some ones online you wanted to hit? All right. Yes. Soon is my answer. I don't think we said, but it's coming soon. So right now, we're in a pilot. It's all 4G LTE. By the way, the 4G LTE customers love this thing. So that's really great. This is such -- as I was just saying in response to the last question, this is such an important business for us. We want to get it right. So, we've taken our time, we're piloting it, we're learning how to serve customers and delight them. But you think about the capacity of this network that Neville is building, and the fact that all of the capital for that network is paid for by the mobile business, that means we have an ability to serve customers with 5G home Internet really cost-effectively because the network is basically already built. And there are places all across this country where no normal amount of mobile usage will soak up all of that massive capacity and that's where we'll be able to offer incredible deals on 5G-powered home Internet. And you don't need a ditch dug to your house, you don't need to use old DSL copper wires, you're going to be able to experience 5G, which is many times faster than, for many people, in today's home Internet connections even in well-served neighborhoods. So, I'm really excited about it. It's coming soon. Can't tell you the date. Sorry for the non-answer. You want one more on Twitter or should we go to the phone? Yes. We'll take those great quarter guys tweet and stay long, but I think -- all right, we'll go back to the phone. So, operator, who's next? Sounds great. Well, we'll start with Sprint and device leasing and everything happening with financing, I'm going to turn to Matt Staneff on that, and then we'll answer your question about the -- about Sprint assets. Okay, and great. On the other piece -- thanks, Matt. On the other piece, it's early days. I can't announce for you any great insights on that question, but I'll say two things. One, the capabilities that we inherited and that we see in this Sprint team and some of the know-how is fantastic. You really can't evaluate this team and its capabilities by the former business results of standalone Sprint. That was a company with lots of structural challenges financially. And so, it was easy to kind of side-eye that operation and assume that it didn't have much to offer. That's totally wrong. Now that we've gotten into it, there's so many best practices that we've been able to begin to adopt into the combined blended total. So that's very exciting, including the team. But to your question, there are also some businesses and capabilities. For example, a wireline capability that standalone T-Mobile never had. So we're taking a great look at that and plenty of other things. So, unfortunately, I can't sort of give you a lot of color on that process because we're looking at it, but when there are stuff to report, we'll be sure to bring it. I appreciate the question, though. Okay. Go back to the phones. Hi, Walt. My favorite number is a 100%, Walt, that's the goal. So please don't reduce Neville's goals. As a follow-up, we probably give you the quarter-by-quarter site count. Yes. I mean, obviously, both elements are important. A couple of things to unpack for you. First of all, we didn't sort of disclosed for you the T-Mobile brand versus Sprint brand. We're just putting it all in there blended. But I can tell you directionally that a big piece of the year-over-year beat isn't just the Sprint, it's over on the T-Mobile side to some just fantastic unprecedented number, so you have to factor that in. And then secondly, yes, it is the big picture. First of all, there's a lot more going on in network than just that 15%. So that's important. The network experience is improving across the board, not just by carrying some of the traffic. But secondly, it's a bigger equation than that. We're now starting to provide them with fantastic offers, we're treating them great. Do you know that we did on care NPS? Just the Net Promoter Score of the care experience, it's tripled since we -- over the past seven months. That's fantastic. The way our care team has started caring for Sprint customers the T-Mobile way and they're responding. So, the network circumstances are improving, the value is improving, the customer experience is improving, and of course, there is a lot more to it than just that 15% of carried traffic. And then over on the T-Mobile side, a big part of our year-over-year beat sits right there. Hopefully that helps. Okay. Yes. Let's go back to the phone. Thanks, Brett. Well, I think certainly there is more willingness from consumers, and I think that's important, because on digital, one of the things that has been so stubborn for all the carriers in the US has been that digitalization has been slow, not because we haven't invested in great capabilities. If you go to our app it's phenomenal, what you can do in it. It's because customers have been slow to adopt it in wireless, specifically. My theory is, it's because of the complexity of what we offer, and all the phone trade-ins and the financing, etc., they want to be somebody in that store to be accountable for sending them out happy. And so, that's happening. In terms of the competitive environment, I -- yes. It looks pretty much like last year to us. And with the exception of the dynamic you mentioned, centered around COVID. And overall switching is muted in Q3. It's muted in Q4. And you saw our guide, we were a little cautious just because it's -- in terms of the way our Q4 unfolds, it's early days. I know it's early November right now so you'd say we're well into the quarter, but not the way Q4 normally unfolds. It's a very holiday-centric quarter. COVID uncertainties with cases on the rise and consumer sentiment unknown, so we gave you a little bit of a cautious guide because we're watching it. But I go back to -- we've got a team that's nimble and confident, it has a great game plan and so far, consumers are responding really well to what we have to offer. So, I can't give you too much more color than that because it's a quarter that's unfolding, but to us, the overall competitive environment doesn't look materially different than last year. You bet. All right. Let's go back to the phone. I do see a couple popping up online now. So we'll do that next. Operator? Well, thanks, Dave. It's great to hear from you, by the way. Glad to have you on the call. Why don't we just go straight to Peter Osvaldik for that? That's great, Matt. Thanks. I'm going to go to Twitter next because there are some great questions developing. By the way, I'm so happy to see all the interest in T-Mobile for Business. Bill Ho, always great to hear from you on every report. Bill says, at T-Mobile Business has increased share, what areas have performed well? And how did the integrated Sprint legacy products and services and sales force contribute? Which verticals are offering the best traction? So that's a great question. And let's kind of also throw it -- let's do the one Roger Entner. Haven't heard from you in a while, Roger. Great to hear from you. Could you -- Roger says, at Mike Sievert, could you break down subscriber growth between consumer and business government? Also, have you started with Project 10Million? And if yes, how many households are using it now? So the short answer is, yes. Not only have we started on it but we've recrafted it. It was originally conceived as a totally free program to invest in the homework gap. What we find this year instead is a schoolwork gap. So, we added an actual paying service. Highly subsidized -- still accretive to contribute to revenues and profits, but highly subsidized to make sure that school kids can benefit from Project 10Million, even if they have increased needs versus what we originally anticipated, up to and including unlimited plans at a very attractive price. And that's actually really contributing. It was a big piece of our numbers this quarter. Our team was faster and more nimble than I think the rest of the industry at seizing a way to really meet this unmet need of public sector and school districts. So very proud of the T-Mobile for Business team. But for a little color on that, plus just how's it going, I'm going to toss outside the room. Maybe, hopefully, he's there. Let's go to Mike Katz on the phone for a little bit more on those. I see Mike. I see him starting to talk. Try it again, Mike. Yes, now we can hear you. Mike, congratulations to the whole TFB team for an all-time record quarter for TFB. It's just amazing. And so, yes, Project 10Million was contributing -- by the way, free product -- Project 10Million also out there in volume helping so many school kids and school districts. That, of course, is not in our numbers, none of that would be reported as a subscriber, but it's just nice to see the difference that our Company is able to make with the size and scale of this network. So, we're so proud of it. Jim Patterson online, no stranger to this Company, by the way. Great to hear from you, Jim. Jim says, at TMUS great report. How will the Company ensure an equal or greater 5G in-building experience for enterprise customers? Will T-Mobile accelerate their in-building deployments or rely on existing towers and small cells to provide coverage? I'll turn it to Neville. I'll just start by saying, first of all, remember, Jim, one of the things that makes this Company so different is that, our low-band is lower, penetrates buildings better, reaches further from towers. Our mid-band reaches miles not meters and can put very, very high-capacity experiences into buildings from the macro network. And that's a differentiator for us. So, we have less reliance on this, but it doesn't mean we're not a friend to it. We certainly are. So, Neville, do you want to talk a little bit... Sounds great. I was nice about it, though. If you give Neville enough time, he'll slay the competition. So, I know we're out of scheduled time, but we'll do two more if we hold ourselves to try and be brief because I want to make sure that we're hitting enough of the people on the phone. So operator, let's go to the phone and we'll do our final two questions. Yes. Craig, I'll be brief on this one instead of tossing it out. The answer is yes, but it's not necessarily yet at scale driving our business centered around new applications. That's common. What's driving our business right now is reliable, high-capacity network leadership on smartphone. And there are plenty of other things that we're working with customers on. But if you're asking what's contributing to our results in getting us in the door, it's that unlike consumers -- and this is really interesting because it goes to the premise that we -- I think the very first question was consumer perception of our network. Unlike consumers, businesses test this stuff. They'll check out 100 phones and run them through the ringer for six weeks and then decide. And you know what? When they do that we're winning, especially to the premise of your question, when the question is, who's got the best 5G coverage and capacity and experience? Because it's just -- it's not even close right now and they know it we're pulling further away from the pack. Businesses want their employees connected right now more than they ever have. They need that connection to be reliable and they need it right now especially to be high-capacity and that's what we're able to offer. So, as we just said, Mike and team just posted the biggest quarter in our history for TFB. We're so proud of them, but this is really more than anything a story about network leadership, we've kind of caught up on LTE. But the real story is how far ahead we are for -- on 5G and how well positioned we are, to the premise of your question, Craig, to stay ahead for the duration of the 5G era. I don't think that's what's driving our business. Yes, of course, they are doing that and with time frame sooner than that. But right now what's driving our business is the dynamic I talked about. And so, a lot of that can be additive when it comes to the low-latency, high-capacity experiences, network as a service for enterprises, automation services, all the things -- augmented reality, virtual reality, all the things that we can deliver with a high-capacity, low-latency network, most of those things are still in our future as it relates to how they can contribute to growth. What's contributing right now is that, they understand our story that we're out in front, and we're going to stay out in front. And I think that's a lot of comfort to somebody picking a partner in the 5G space. Okay. Great to hear from you. Let's go to what I think is going to be our last question, right? Because the time frame, I want to be respectful we said 2:30. So, operator, let's go to the last question. Sounds great. Well, on the first one, you have to look underneath everybody's report. When you look underneath ours, you saw postpaid phones again leading the industry very strong performance on the centerpiece that we've always focused on. The prepaid leader, T-Mobile continuing to grow from a leadership position, which is not something you've been able to see postpaid leaders do reliably in the past, so that's great. And then you saw our great outsized performance on postpaid other, driven by a number of different dynamics, including those dynamics you talked about. People adding to their relationships with us, but also new opportunities in TFB, we spent some time on the call talking about. So that's what happens when you double click into ours. When you double click into our competitors, there are some gymnastics. A lot of the big numbers have to do with like reversing accruals from previous quarters that were too conservative, or strange things in the prepaid space having to do with connected cars and accrual reversals that when you really look underneath it, I don't think cricket's crowing at all. In fact, I think they reduced. So, you really have to look through the reports right now because COVID made things so difficult. What you get from us is transparency, lots and lots of it, you got to work a little harder to get underneath the reports of our competitors. But I think you're seeing because of this public sector the dynamic, you're also seeing some terrific category growth. And then you asked about Shentel, so do we want to say anything, give an update on how that's [indiscernible] we can't, right? Yes. I hate to end on no, we have no response. But we're following a process. The original agreement is that we had with a couple of these partners called for us to have the rights to buy and there is a prescribed process on valuation and we're following that process and we just don't have anything to report. So, I'm ending this call on a no comment. That's great. Listen, you guys, thank you for you're in. We're so proud of the results that the Company was able to post. Really look forward to talking to you again when we report the full-year and double clicking with a longer conversation with our 2021 Analyst Day, so stay tuned for all that. Thanks, everybody."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead sir.\nJud Henry: Good afternoon and welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; Neville Ray, our President, Technology; Matt Staneff, Our Chief Marketing Officer; and Janice Kapner our Chief Communications Officer; as well as other members of the senior leadership team joining us remotely. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results, our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our merger with Sprint, our business and operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current, beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our filings with the SEC. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP metrics we discuss on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations page on our website. Also, I want to point out that our comments related to Q2 2020 reflect the combined results of new T-Mobile\u2019s unless otherwise noted. The prior period results and earnings materials that accompany our Q2 results represent the standalone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. While we do provide some unaudited pro forma historical financials on a supplemental basis, they are not directly comparable with the actual results for new T-Mobile in the second quarter and going forward, nor are they directly comparable with the previously provided pro forma financials that were prepared prior to the completion of final purchase price accounting and policy alignment issues. We are not providing pro forma historical customer base metrics due to the inability to repose its historical activity under all new T-Mobile subscriber policy. As such, we will focus our comments on future results and the comparable forward-looking guidance as the best way of looking at the business moving forward.  With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks Jud, and hi to everybody listening in or watching online. We are coming to you live and socially distanced from here in our Bellevue headquarters. So I am pleased that nice to be back in the office for once given if we are behind this huge flexi glass panels and sitting 10 feet apart. First of all, let me just say, thanks in advance for your patience, because my upfront remarks will be just a few minutes longer than usual today given that this is our first quarterly report for the new company and there is a lot to cover. I promise I am not filibuster. Q2 was our first quarter together and what a quarter it was. I am incredibly fired up about everything this new combined team has accomplished since we last spoke in May and I am more excited than ever about the future of T-Mobile.  We have already hit major milestones in record time and made significant progress on integration and we did it while achieving incredible business results for the quarter. We know, that very quarter our competitors were telling you we\u2019d be too distracted by the merger to execute, yes, that\u2019s what. So let me start by saying this, we kicked off the quarter by achieving something nobody really thought possible just a short time ago.  Our total branded customer accounts surpassed AT&T, making us the number two player in wireless at the beginning of the quarter. This monumental milestone in U.S. wireless history was a historic achievement for all of us at T-Mobile. And even better we haven\u2019t looked back since. We have no intention of slowing down.  Our lead versus AT&T is even wider as we talk to you today. In Q2, T-Mobile once again led the industry in total branded customer growth for the 22nd consecutive quarter firmly establishing new T-Mobile as the leading growth company in the industry. Now with over 98 million customers at quarter end, we are steering down Verizon, but our site sat on the number one spot.  Despite the significant challenges we all face this quarter, in T-Mobile\u2019s case including combining with a much slower growth company in Sprint and continuing to deal with the global pandemic that led to a lower switching environment, this team adapted and delivered.  We didn\u2019t skip a beat that. In fact, we moved faster. We again led the industry at adding 1.2 million total branded customers across postpaid and prepaid in Q2, four and three times AT&T and Verizon combined. Total postpaid net additions were 1.1 million, also leading the industry and over three times more than Verizon who was the closest competitor. We actually got something of a formulator when trying to divide by a negative number for our AT&T comparison. And believe we grow that.  Needless to say, we are still competing aggressively and our team is having fun with it. And while we are on this topic, I do want to take this opportunity to recognize our T-Mobile core business team for really stepping up in a big way to help schools and businesses adapting to new remote learning and work challenges that are needed.  Most of our overperformance this quarter versus guidance on postpaid was in this area. We also delivered 253,000 postpaid phone net adds, beating the national carriers again for the 26th quarter in a row. And this is after taking a 90,000 unit postpaid customer disconnect approval related to the FCC\u2019s keeping Americans connected.  And not to be forgotten, we also delivered Q2 postpaid phone churn of 0.8%, prepaid churn of just 2.81%. I am particularly proud of the churn progress as we integrate the traditionally higher churning Sprint business.  Now lets\u2019 talk about how all of our teams\u2019 hard work and real-time adjustments to the rapidly changing market resulted in incredibly strong Q2 financial results. This includes adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 billion, which exceeded our guidance.  Our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik will share more on our financial results in a moment, but I\u2019ll just remind you that our formula is pretty simple. Investing in customers leads to customer growth which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, a lot of which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience.  It\u2019s a virtuous cycle that delivered all of our early success as the un-carrier and it will continue to propel us to our goal of being number one in customer choice and number one in customer starts. While delivering these accomplishments, we kicked off a huge list of accomplishments that positioned new T-Mobile to win.  Peter will share more details about our work in the market, but I just wanted to mention three big milestones. First, our team executed the largest dual tranche secondary offering in U.S. history, the sale of SoftBank\u2019s shares in T-Mobile and actually created a positive trading dynamic in our stock with the transaction.  We also fulfilled a major merger commitment when we closed our transaction with DISH to divest the Sprint Prepaid business. And we issued $4 billion of senior secured notes a weighted average interest rate of just 2.16% all three had super successful outcome.  On the customer side, we launched Connecting Heroes providing free smartphone service and 5G access to state and local non-profit first responder agencies nationwide. This was the second initiative in our 5G for good un-carrier announced this from last year following T-Mobile Connect the low price plan we launched ahead of schedule in Q1. The final part of that move, Project 10 Million will be coming very soon, so stay tuned.  And we unveiled our latest un-carrier move Scam Shield. Scams and robo calls are a huge customer pain and in fact they are the leading FCC complaint. So we put together the industry\u2019s most comprehensive solution for customers to help stop distributes. With Scam Shield we are helping protect T-Mobile natural by T-Mobile and Sprint customers \u2013 they can scammers for free, while AT&T and Verizon make customers paid for it by requiring a certain plan or phone or premium add-on.  This move clearly mattered to consumers, because this announcement drove massive social media engagement and the most press coverage we\u2019ve received since our first un-carrier move way back in March of 2013. Unlike all un-carrier moves, Scam Shield is designed to change wireless for good. So I hope that AT&T and Verizon will step up to our challenge and join us in taking this problem a lot more serious.  And I can\u2019t forget to mention that T-Mobile\u2019s care team continues to break record. We just recently received the highest ever score recorded in our industry on the J.D. Power2020 Customer Care Survey taking home our sixth win in a row and the 20th time we\u2019ve ranked highest among full service providers. Our team loves our customers and it shows.  Okay. I really just scratched the surface on what this team accomplished this past quarter, but I know you are all really interested in our talk books and that\u2019s of course integration. And the work we are doing to build big and build fast on synergy attainment.  Let\u2019s start with the network. This is a huge piece of our synergy realization. Neville and his team are full steam ahead. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that our \u2013 that the biggest block of our synergies come from the network and that it\u2019s a three step process as we first light up the available Sprint spectrum on the new T-Mobile anchor network which second, creates the capacity to migrate the Sprint traffic over.  And then third, allows us to finally decommission the sites that aren\u2019t in the go forward. That of course takes time and amazingly decommissioning, the third step, our initial sites is already under \u2013 The network teams working and overdrive to migrate Spring postpaid traffic on to the T-Mobile network and it shows.  In fact, as of today, we have already moved more than 10% of this traffic before we\u2019ve even started the customer migration. This is possible, because we now have more than 85% of Sprint postpaid phone base with devices that work on the T-Mobile network, something we made fully available right out of the gate.  So now, over 10 million Sprint postpaid customers on average are using the T-Mobile network every single day, plus the Sprint base historically had limited access to VoLTE, voice-over-LTE. But we already have roughly 75% of the Sprint postpaid base now enabled on VoLTE. So they are enjoying a better voice experience with simultaneous data. I hope those stats straight you as surprising and unprecedented, was they are.  We also officially unveiled our retail operations and unified our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores last Sunday. This is an important milestone for our business and while we did it, we also rolled out the needed tools and systems across our distribution footprint to allow us to serve both legacy bases of postpaid customers in all T-Mobile stores.  Let me be clear, this was a massive lift. I just can\u2019t say enough that how our team flawlessly nailed this effort and executed incredibly fast. This would have been a major accomplishment even outside of a pandemic, it was really amazing to see all of that come to life during these complicated times.  And since the bringing two big brands like T-Mobile and Sprint together only comes around once we want it to market in true un-carrier fashion by doing something really big for our customers. So we launched four for hundred. Yes, four lines of the industry\u2019s best unlimited for $25 each per month. This is possibly our most ambitious consumer promotion ever and it includes 5G access.  Remember, the other guys maybe charging extra for 5G, ours includes it. Now to be clear, this is a limited time promotion to celebrate and build awareness for the newly integrated brand but even after it\u2019s done. We\u2019ll find out our ways to compete. We said we bring the competition with this merger and I hope we\u2019ve addressed any lingering questions on that front.  I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. We are here to show customers that they no longer have to choose between the best value and the best network with T-Mobile, they\u2019ll get full. Our teams also been working hard to rapidly deliver T-Mobile benefits to legacy Sprint customers and they are loving all the un-carrier goodness like having access to the same great unlimited plans without future step ups. And perks like T-Mobile Tuesdays.  Well the synergies we are starting to see are not just for our investors, our customers are winning big too. At the same time, we are focused on evolving our organization structure and design to become one team that will be more efficient and more effective with clear roles and responsibilities for our employees that will help us all move faster and deliver results for the business.  This was a process that we originally expected to take 12 to 18 month, but we nearly completed in just one quarter and we felt it was important to do so. And, we are hiring. We\u2019ve double down in areas that are focused on better serving our customers today and in the future by kicking off our un-carrier jobs initiative, add 5,000 new positions in just the first 12 months alone.  We also accelerated the rationalization of hundreds of retail stores, work that we originally planned to do over several quarters and we consolidated and began to adjust our marketing spend well ahead of schedule. These actions in Q2 alone are beginning to unlock significant synergies now, setting us up financially to be able to make investments throughout 2020 and next year and ultimately unlocking future synergies on a net basis.  Last time I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger. I just \u2013 I hope now you understand why. We are executing lightening fast. We said we would, but now we\u2019ve laid down a ton of track, thus, based on the quick action we\u2019ve taken, I am confident in our ability to not only deliver $43 billion in synergies like we previously talked about, but potentially unlock even more than originally planned and to do it all faster than planned.  Now let me just say a few words about one of my favorite topics, our rapidly expanding network. In the 5G race, T-Mobile is pulling way ahead. In the past few years, we\u2019ve heard a lot of competitive \u2013 in marketing speak when it comes to 5G, all talk, and most of it is just higher. AT&T and Verizon don\u2019t want you see what\u2019s becoming so painfully obvious. T-Mobile is miles ahead of both of them and we are quickly pulling away from the past.  But instead of taking my word forward or Verizon\u2019s or AT&T\u2019s for that matter, let\u2019s just take a look at few actionable facts. Nobody disputes that we have America\u2019s largest 5G network and the competition isn\u2019t even close. Just this week, we had a major breakthrough when we launched standalone 5G. Now, our 5G network reaches over 250 million people, and 1.3 million square miles.  We now offer coverage across all 50 states and Puerto Rico on 5G. This geographic coverage is roughly double AT&T\u2019s and exponentially higher than Verizon. But it\u2019s not just our reach that matters. It\u2019s the experience our customers have on our network too that differentiates T-Mobile\u2019s 5G from the other wireless players.  Verizon, as you know, likes to spend a lot of time telling you that they have a real 5G, but its 5G is all about ultra wide band or a millimeter win. But again, let\u2019s put the facts on the table. T-Mobile customers with 5G handsets already have faster average speeds in more places than Verizon customers with 5G handsets. And we are just getting started lighting up our mid-band.  We are already lighting it up in 2.5 GHz in major metros including New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Washington DC and Atlanta. And by the end of the year, customers will find mid-band 5G in thousands of cities and towns across the country.  At the end of this year, we are currently seeing average speeds north of 300 megabits per second, better than most home internet speeds and eight times faster than 4G LTE, but peak speeds of a gigabit. It will be even faster as we exit the year, plus a massive footprint. But even today, we have the advantage.  Take a look at open signal plays. T-Mobile customers have the best 5G availability meaning that un-carrier customers get a 5G signal more often than customers on any other network, that\u2019s two times more than AT&T\u2019s 5G and it is six times more than Verizon.  Not to mention, we go found that T-Mobile customers get a 5G signal in nearly four times more cities than Verizon and AT&T combined. By the way, Verizon would also like to excitedly tell you that in that same Ookla test, they have the fastest 5G speed scores, but they often forget to also mention that you can only find their 5G 0.4% of the time.  And maybe they\u2019ll deliver nationwide 5G coverage some day, but they\u2019ll beg, borrow and steal from their LTE networks to claiming the tools like dynamic spectrum sharing will overcome their spectrum shortage. When you get to what\u2019s real about 5G, T-Mobile\u2019s network is demonstrably ahead of the competition even as we just start pouring on the gas.  And it\u2019s now clear to most observers that it takes all circumvents to build a real 5G network, and our strategy to use 600 MHz low band as the foundation for 5G, something we had planned for years in advance was the right move to make. But it also shows just how well positioned we are to take share in the 5G era that everyone is now talking about.  T-Mobile controls 319 MHz of combined low and mid band spectrum on average nationwide. That\u2019s more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We also have more millimeter wave spectrum than AT&T and get this, we already have as many 5G devices on our network as AT&T and Verizon combined. This is a huge advantage for us as 5G becomes more prevalent for businesses and consumers.  All of our brands will benefit from a robust 5G network and according to the facts on the ground, T-Mobile customers are already taking advantage of how quickly we lit up that 600 MHz footprint. And the work we\u2019ve already begun to do to rapidly increase capacity and boost speeds with the second layer of our 5G layer gig, our deep 2.5Ghz spectrum Honestly, I don\u2019t think I could be more excited about the progress we\u2019ve made on this network and what we are building every single day. The fastest President Neville will tell us more about all of this when he gets his first question almost regardless of the question he actually gets asked.  As the gross leader in wireless, we are poised to bring an even more capable un-carrier to even more customers in more places. We are building the best network and offering the best value and that\u2019s what\u2019s super charging the un-carrier is all about. We\u2019ve set the stage for a strong second half by delivering powerful Q2 results.  But as you know, we are not stopping there. I really believe that as the 5G era finally gets underway at scale later this year, this is our moment. We are way ahead. We have the strongest assets and we have what will very quickly become the demonstrably superior network in the U.S. combined with the un-carriers brand DNA. That\u2019s a powerful combination that our competitors will struggle to match and that will translate into results.  Okay. Now I am going to ask our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. Most of you know Peter. Prior to taking this role, Peter was already a huge contributor to our outstanding results. He serves for years as our Chief Accounting Officer and number two Financial Officer, participating in every major financial decision that we make.  And like me, he knows what it\u2019s like to have big shoes to fill and his transition to the CFO role has been seamless. It comes at an important time for our business. So I am thrilled to have him in the role and Peter, take it away. \nPeter Osvaldik: Alright. Thanks, Mike. I couldn\u2019t be more excited to lead as CFO during this critical time for the business. We have an incredible all star leadership team and I feel privileged to be working alongside each of you. We\u2019ll continue to execute on our proven playbook and unlocked incredible synergy potential of this merger for the years to come.  Before we get into the financial details, I wanted to cover off on a few points which lay the ground work for our reporting. First, we aligned the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile subscribers to our go forward new T-Mobile policies.  The net impact of these changes as outlined in more detail in our investor fact book and 10-Q resulted in a net reduction in total branded customers 14.1 million as of April 1, as compared to the standalone balances previously reported for Sprint and T-Mobile as of March 31.  The biggest adjustment was the removal of $9.2 million customers associated with the DISH divestiture including 963,000, which have been classified as postpaid phone customers in the previously reported Sprint figures. The adjustments also included approximately 40 million subscribers associated with reseller arrangements which were reclassified from postpaid to wholesale.  And recall, that we no longer report wholesale subscribers rather focusing on wholesale revenue. It is important to remember that these adjustments have more net impact on profitability. In addition, we are providing disclosures around the various impacts from purchase accounting and policy alignment in our 10-Q, but in the interest of time, I won\u2019t get into too much detail right now.  Okay. Now let\u2019s get into some of the financial details of the second quarter. Note that during this quarter, our pretax financial results were impacted by merger-related costs of $798 million, COVID-19-related costs of $341 million, as well as non-cash impairment charges of $418 million related to changes in our postpaid billing systems strategy and a strategic shift in product transport division enabled through the merger.  These costs are combined $1.56 billion before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Q2 net income of $110 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.09 were negatively impacted by these combined factors by $1.25 billion and $1.01 per share. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7 billion, exceeding our guidance range.  Total service revenue of $13.2 billion was primarily driven by the merger, as well as continued customer growth, partially offset by a customated 1% to 2% headwind from COVID-19 related events. And note for the reported service revenues excluded this which was reflected in discontinued operations. Next quarter, the revenue from these customers will be reported in our wholesale service revenues.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $777 million, which includes $370 million for merger-related costs and $243 million for COVID-19 related costs. This includes the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps on merger financing.  Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $119 million amounted to $2.3 billion. Free cash flow, excluding the settlement of interest rate swaps that I just mentioned was $1.4 billion, and recall for the swap, the net cash outflow was only $1.1 billion, as there was an inflow of $1.2 billion in cash flows from investing activities for the return of collateral previously provided.  Postpaid ARPA or Average Revenue Per Account amounted to 130.57 and postpaid phone ARPU was 47.99. In terms of customer quality, our results in the second quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic requirements of COVID-19.  Total bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables was $263 million or 1.49 of total revenues. This includes approximately $46 million of incremental expense related to the FCC pledge that was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. If we normalize for this amount attributable to the FCC pledge, bad debt would have been 1.23% of revenues, in line with last quarter.  As we monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and the FCC pledge in our business, we are encouraged by some of the early trends. 95% of all accounts that took advantage of the pledge have made some form of payments since going on the field.  Notwithstanding high customer engagement and solid payment performance thus far, there is a small subset of FCC pledge customers that likely will not recover. As a result, our postpaid results for Q2 reflect an accrual of approximately 110,000 deactivations, including 90,000 postpaid phones as Mike mentioned, for customers that were still with us at the end of the quarter under the FCC pledge, but whom we expect will likely not pay off their remaining balances.  Shifting gears to our capital markets activity, in just one quarter as a combined company, we raised $27 billion including $4 billion of senior secured notes issued in June at an average yield of 2.16%, a debt neutral refinancing transaction in which the proceeds will be used to retire high yield debt in Q3, with an MPD benefit of approximately $400 million and record low average yield for our company, this deal was extremely well received and is a testament to the strength of our business and balance sheet.  And also, we delivered $20 billion secondary sale of SoftBank shares to the public and T-Mobile received a $300 million fee for facilitating the transaction in addition to being reimbursed for all expenses, just remarkable execution by the team in transactions that I am extremely proud of.  Okay. Let me now turn to our guidance, which we wanted to provide as we continue to prioritize transparency during uncertain times and when others across the industry have opted to provide little or no guidance compared to normal practice.  We are not immune to uncertainty either, but we recognize our unique situation as we provide you with the first set of combined results this quarter including the impacts of purchase price accounting and policy alignments and therefore we felt it was very important that we combine with best efforts guidance for the back half of 2020.  As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer behavior, as well as economic environment related to the pandemic and how it may impact our second half results. New T-Mobile aspires to continue to lead the industry in postpaid growth and expect postpaid net customer additions between 1.7 million and 1.9 million, just a double click here of it, this guidance assumes higher postpaid phone net adds in the third and fourth quarters from what we saw in Q2 also while there was a tremendous opportunity to move quickly and win share of postpaid other devices as businesses and schools adapted during environments of remote working and learning, we expect to see a more balanced mix of postpaid phone versus other additions in the back half of the year.  We expect higher gross adds as industry churn levels increase both from typical higher seasonality and the muted churn effect in Q2 as a result of COVID-19. And we see this as an exciting opportunity as net share taker. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion for the back half of 2020 and includes leasing revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.  We expect higher SG&A expenses in the second half, driven by higher selling expenses due to increased gross adds and the impact of close to $319 million of COVID-19 related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA in Q2, moving back into normalized selling expenses.  Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion as we continue to build out America\u2019s largest 5G network, we expect CapEx to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 before ramping significantly in Q4. For the second half of 2020, merger and integration-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes and subject to our ability to go faster on integration.  While expenses in Q2 were primarily driven by severance and merger deal fees, we expect merger and integration-related cost in the second half to be primarily operational in focus. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger and integration-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion.  Free cash flow, including payments for merger and integration-related cost is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, impacted by the aforementioned merger cost and increased capital spending on the network.  And lastly, in the back half of 2020, our expected effective tax rate will be in the range of 31% to 33%, due primarily to certain non-deductible and merger-related cost incurred in the first half of the year that continue to impact the tax rate throughout 2020. However, we anticipate our future rate to be more in line with historical levels.  Now let\u2019s get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. \nMike Sievert: And operator, I would like to just point out that in honor of Rich Greenfield and everybody at light shed, we will only be taking questions this quarter from people that begin their question with a phrase, great quarter guys. Just kidding. Operator. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First we\u2019ll go to Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nPhil Cusick : Hey guys. Thank you. A lot of things to ask about, but I think the number one as I am talking to people here is on the second half guidance. The $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion, can you help us bring that back to what I would have considered a \u2013 like a historical T-Mobile cash EBITDA without EIP benefit and submitting out of a lease benefit?\nMike Sievert: Peter, why don\u2019t you start? And it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really about backing out the lease revenues. If you want to look at what kind of \u2013 what we call core EBITDA, not so much for yield. \nPhil Cusick : I am sorry. \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, yes. Absolutely. And let me begin with, obviously, the second half guidance is also reflective of increased gross adds from SG&A, right. And that\u2019s both from a seasonal uptick that we expect as an industry in turn which is typical from Q3 to the second half, but also as a result of the COVID-19 cost, $300 million that were excluded in Q2 that again will become part of the normal runrate. And then, you have the leasing revenues, as you said, if you wanted to the core adjusted EBITDA. \nPhil Cusick : Okay. So that $10.1 billion to \u2013 or $10 billion to 10.1 billion or so, that\u2019s what you would consider to be sort of a cash EBITDA number the way T-Mobile used to operate? \nMike Sievert: Yes, the way we use to operate, right. Nothing has really changed in terms of how we think about this stuff, right. So, we have adjusted EBITDA and then you have leasing and lease revenues get backed out, to get to this more operational view, adjusted EBITDA is what we focus on and guide on those. So it\u2019s important that you understand that and obviously bringing in Sprint, there is a much bigger leasing component. And so the differences between the two are greater, now that we\u2019ve merged. \nPhil Cusick : Yes. And that\u2019s the second thing I wanted to ask was, historically, Sprint did a lot of leasing. T-Mobile tried it and it didn\u2019t seem like you guys liked it very much. Should we \u2013 it looks like from the guidance we should expect you to continue to be leasing the phones in a pretty substantial way at least through this year, how do you think about that offer? \nMike Sievert: Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Matt Staneff to jump in. Phil, it\u2019s not that we didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s that our view is that, it hasn\u2019t always been demonstrated to add to enterprise value. And because the customer satisfaction isn\u2019t there and then you cost later on as a result. So, but it\u2019s a tool in the toolkit. We\u2019ve always done some of it.  I think, it depends on how it\u2019s done and we are open to it. The guide doesn\u2019t necessarily imply any big change, obviously. So, leasing revenues come from the runrate that is informed by the customers already in the base. But, Matt, other thoughts about financing in general and how we think about it? \nMatt Staneff : Yes. That\u2019s great. So, as Mike said, we are going to continue with past day one. Right now, we\u2019ve got our new proposition in the market largely it\u2019s T-Mobile the way it was before. The one thing we do that we have a Sprint customer base and we are very aggressively taking care of those customers, now watching and managing their churn helping us. A lot of them are on lease upgrade offers. And so, what you can expect over time obviously is we are not going to take away seeing some customers that could potentially increase churn. We are going to continue to serve them. And so, that\u2019s part of what you see in the leasing mix as we got options available, the T-Mobile options that we are still going to take care of for customers. And so it will be kind of more of a gradual change in the total mix versus what we are doing for new customers with that. \nPhil Cusick : I appreciate. Thanks. \nMike Sievert: What we\u2019ll do over \u2013 but right now, as you know, we ask a one and therefore our main go to market for us to center ground. But we have all these tens of millions of Sprint customers and a lot of them make like leasing in one another lease device and we are happy to provide that. So, see that level. \nPhil Cusick : Yes, got it. \nMike Sievert: Thanks, Phil. \nPhil Cusick : Thanks guys. \nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to our next question, John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is open. \nJohn Hodulik : Okay. Great quarter guys. Actually I got two questions. First of all, the 80 bps I am sure that that was particularly sort of a bit of a surprise especially as Sprint a year ago had, I think 1.8% churn. So, what are you doing to bring that down so quickly, especially given all the integration efforts of the store closings and that kind of things?  That\u2019s number one. And then, number two, given the availability to 600 MHz spectrum, and the pent-up demand for new phones, are you guys looking at the launch of the iPhone in the fourth quarter as an opportunity to take share?  And is that baked into the guidance in back half because I\u2019d point out that you had $7 billion in EBITDA for the quarter but just expecting sort of $12 billion, $12.5 billion for the rest of the year. So, obviously, it looks like you are expecting that\u2019s not necessarily to be the runrate, especially as we look out to the fourth quarter? That would be great. Thanks. \nMike Sievert: Understood. Matt, do you want to start on churn? \nMatt Staneff : Yes. I\u2019ll start on churn. 80 bps that\u2019s a great number. It\u2019s a great number to have in the first quarter. Now that we are together and the comparison is accurate. T-Mobile was among the leaders in the category and as you said, Sprint was in the high ones. I think the last 42 close to 106 and down 180 basis points. One thing to consider is, this was done in Q2 when covered with the Q. And we said the switch in flows were down.  We were taking care of customers and then a collection - we\u2019ve accounted for all of that. But Q2 is a bit of an anomaly and you\u2019ve seen that across the industry in terms of what churn has done. We have been very hard at work. We\u2019ve been talking about what we\u2019ve done, getting the Sprint customer base access to the network. We\u2019ve got 10 million customers kind of on a daily basis using the network.  We could provide VoLTE with a much better experience and we\u2019ve been hard at work giving value to the Sprint customer base. And taking un-carrier principles and deploying them pretty broadly across the base. So we are not predicting where churn will go. And like just Peter said, seasonally it\u2019s going to be up a little bit and in the third quarter and we\u2019ve put that into our guidance.  And I can\u2019t predict where churn will go, but what I can say is that things we need to get to where it was at 0.80 last quarter, we are going to keep doing and more of as we move forward. \nMike Sievert: And not to mention in addition, but the legacy T-Mobile side of things, which will be increasingly difficult for us, I am back for you because we are past day one now and where business going forward. But, the legacy T-Mobile\u2019s side had a blockbuster low churn number. And so, blended in that also helps. So this is really gratifying. We have tailwinds on churn over the medium and long haul, because we know what drives it.  We have seen this journey on the T-Mobile side from some of the highest churn in the industry to some of the best churn in the industry in its network. And where, I just got done talking at length about how no one is going to be able to catch us on network. So we are really excited and to Matt\u2019s point, seasonally this year, there are going to be two dynamics.  One, COVID-19, we think the impacts of it will start to abate which brings some normalcy back into the suppression this quarter, as well as what\u2019s normal T-Mobile which is a seasonal uptick in the second half, all in against the backdrop of real exciting tailwinds. So, that\u2019s the first piece.  And the second piece you asked about was, kind of how to think about the second half and I will say, we have burdened our plan with the activations, we think are necessary to deliver the growth that we guided. And that means, we know that gross activations will up in the second half, why I just told you that seasonally and due to COVID, churn will be up and we\u2019ll outrun that churn and the other guy\u2019s churn will be up and that\u2019s an opportunity for us.  When the other guy\u2019s churn goes up a little bit, that\u2019s when we compete. You asked about phones. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t comment about phones. I really hope there is a well rounded 5G phone portfolio as we exit the year. And so, I\u2019ll just leave it there and if there is, that would be a great competitive moment for us. So, hopefully, that helps, John.\nJohn Hodulik : Yes. Thanks, Mike. \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Mike Rollins with Goldman Sachs. I am sorry, Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. I apologize. Your line is open. \nBrett Feldman: Hey. Thank you for squeezing in. Hopefully Mike come next. I think, you need call this a good quarter. So congratulations on that. I want to talk about the integration. You expressed your confidence and the synergy targets that you had outlined in the release. All the commentary sounds like, you are just moving faster than I think we would have expected, when you first now at the field two years ago.  And one of the questions will be, do we think we can start seeing the synergies come into your numbers more quickly, that would seem like you would be accretive to the NPV and also the integration spending that you outlined for the second half of this year, actually looks pretty modest considering that you had previously talked about spending $15 billion through the integration.  So, that\u2019s when you are going to win much more significantly as we move past this year, what would drive that, or are you actually at the point where maybe you are realizing there greater efficiencies associated with the integration as you get closer to execution on it? Thank you. \nMike Sievert: Yes. Let me start and then ask Neville to comment. First of all, I love the fact that some of the tower companies that are out there sort of spreading some disinformation about our pace. I just got them tell you we are in all the biggest cities in the country with 2.5Ghz 5G already. And we will be in thousands of cities and towns across this country as we exit this year with that layer gig.  So, we are \u2013 that\u2019s what where we\u2019ll be running really fast. Reason it feels tough over there at the tower companies is because both standalone T-Mobile and Sprint were planning on lots of new sites. Sprint for coverage and T-Mobile for capacity. New T-Mobile has synergies, that\u2019s called site avoidance and I know that\u2019s tough, if you are a tower company, because millions and billions of dollars of site avoidance are just the kinds of comments you are now hearing.  That doesn\u2019t affect our rate and pace we are going like crazy. And you are right, there is not only speed potential which is NPV accretive, but look, the faster we get out in front of the pack on the demonstrable customer provable network leadership, the more of the operating results start to give us the potential to start talking to you about the magnitude of synergies as well.  And the enterprise value created from outgrowing our competitors. So, Neville, why don\u2019t you tell us a little bit about the rate and pace, because I know that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind? \nNeville Ray: Yes. I mean, thanks, Mike. I mean, we are moving at an incredible pace. I mean, I could not be more pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in what\u2019s a few short weeks since we combined with the Sprint team. And it\u2019s on two fronts, I mean, we\u2019ve been rapidly accelerating the breadth of this network, if I talk to the 250 million people now covered the T-Mobile\u2019s low band 5G, 327 million of people covered with LTE too, right, and we are closing in on that opportunity for in our 5G footprint.  So, that gives us the breadth. The depth comes from the 2.5 Ghz spectrum, the mid band slice that\u2019s so important. And all I can say is, we are baking that cake super, super fast. So, to give you some idea and dimension that for you, I mean, as we get to the second quarter, every week, we were starting up great activity on about 600 sites per week.  In the last month, that number has gone to 700 sites per week. So, you can all do that math that thousands of sites in a month and in the quarter and we are running very, very hard of having that mid-band layer of the network to this great opportunity. Mike outlined the experience and the speeds.  To the earlier question about, 5G phones in fourth quarter, and we have a great line-up today, lots of great phones, great news from Samsung just the other day announced and we want to make sure that there is really only one 5G network that you would love to put a 5G phone on. And it\u2019s from T-Mobile.  The coverage is spotting your best from AT&T, nascent from Verizon and when you can combine great coverage with great performance and speed with mid band inside the fourth quarter, that\u2019s going to be a complete game changer. So, great quarter. Great numbers.  But we are only just getting started with this network roll out and the pace is phenomenal. Mike outlined, obviously, we are not building in all the places, but standalone T-Mobile and Sprint would have planned to and that\u2019s good for this business, right. We are starting to generate those cost avoidance, site avoidance synergies at pace, real pace in the second half of this year and we\u2019ll talk to those numbers more as we close out 2020. But tremendous progress underway and I couldn\u2019t be happy of.  Tower guys not so happy. We could be doing some more with the tower guys, but there is a competitive process in play right now and we have choices that we can make. So, I would fully anticipate that we will start more tower build as we move into the second half, but to be seen. That doesn\u2019t slow us down. We have lots of options to build and we are building furiously. \nMike Sievert: And Peter, just very briefly on Brett\u2019s last part, he was asking about the operational spend and it was maybe, it sounded like it may have been a little less than he was expecting given the Q2 spend. Do you want to unpack that a little bit? Because I think that\u2019s some point people will understand.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Absolutely, Brett. And as we said, what you saw in Q2, while there was an elevated amount of merger-related cost, there was a lot of transaction and then restructuring and severance, right from acceleration of some of those synergy opportunities. When we fled them to the second half, it is primarily, what I would call operational synergy capture now. So, that\u2019s when you think about the pace, that\u2019s an element to consider in there. And of course it\u2019s subject to us identifying ways to prudently go faster, which we are going to continue to do, just like you saw in Q2. \nMike Sievert: But in other words, operationally, it\u2019s rapidly growing in the second half. The operational component of our cost to achieve in Q2 is actually quite small. Most of it was deal-related transaction cost and so the \u2013 and it\u2019s all operational from here on. So, it\u2019s a big, big uptick in actual cost to achieve going through the system in the second half. \nMike Sievert: Brett. Thanks a lot. \nBrett Feldman: Is the $15 billion still the budget \u2013 sorry is this $15 billion still the budget in the outlook for integration? \nMike Sievert: Yes, nothing really has broadly changed in our aspirations and at some point by the way, you raised a good question, at some point I know what, we\u2019ll owe you an update on all that. We keep saying and I hopefully we backed it up with actual evidence and reasons why we are saying it today by giving you something to chew on.  But we keep saying, hey, we are more confident now. This two year old plan, we think it may be a little conservative. I know we owe you some more color on that, but let\u2019s say, we have one \u2013 exactly one data point for this company so far and that\u2019s today\u2019s report. So, we are going to get a little bit more a line established for you and then we\u2019ll give you a different updated way to think about the future. So, I know we owe you that. \nBrett Feldman: Great. Fair enough. Thank you. \nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks. Operator? Meanwhile \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Rollins. Sorry go ahead. \nMike Sievert: Sorry, operator, who is next? \nOperator: Next we have Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. \nMichael Rollins: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks. Well, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Couple quick questions. First, when the deal was originally announced, the management teams talked about in the pro formas, there were some expectations of revenue headwinds of Sprint plans migrate into T-Mobile plans and as you now finish this process of bringing the Sprint metrics and measures over to T-Mobile, how do you look at any potential headwinds from repricing to T-Mobile plans over the next few years?  And then, secondly, I was just curious if we can get an update on distribution and distribution presence, as you\u2019ve integrated \u2013 still managing through the pandemic and maybe some observations of customer behavior is changing upon store reopening staying more digital or it\u2019s reverting back to the historical get into the store and have a hand holding that the reps in the store deliver to the customers? Thanks. \nMike Sievert: Yes. You bet. And by the way I got so enamored with the second part. Tell me the first part again, what was the management \nMichael Rollins: Revenue. \nMike Sievert: Yes. So, listen, on pricing, revenues and ARPU and all that, one of the things you got, I think from our report was that we see a relatively stable outlook in the near-term. For competitors, I guess, didn\u2019t guide or give you much to go on, we felt with the new company it was important to us to just do a best efforts view and we don\u2019t see catalysts in the near-term for big changes one way or the other in ARPU.  Separately, you heard Peter start to talk about ARPA. And that we\u2019re looking at this at a household level, because we think there is, in the 5G era, there is all kinds of opportunities to develop deeper relationships with households that would be accretive to ARPA without necessarily affecting ARPU.  Thirdly, I\u2019ll say, our plan all along has been to bring a intense level of competition to this market like we have always done as the un-carrier, but now in a sustainable way backed by the long-term network plans that we have. And that\u2019s obviously going to be to the benefit of consumers and we funded that fully in our model.  How that relates to ARPU specifically and how that will unfold over the years, again, I know we have a two year old set of spots and at some point need to update that. But a few things to say. We are bringing competition into the market.  That\u2019s who we are. We\u2019ve got the capacity to do it. It would be crazy not to leverage that capacity advantage to compete hard and grow top-line revenues through competition. So, that\u2019s number one. Number two, in the very near-term, we see no real catalyst one way or the other for ARPU changes. So we see it generally stable for the second half as we commented on. And then, Matt, do you want to jump into the second half? \nMatt Staneff: Yes. I\u2019ll tackle that, Mike. I think the question was a little bit around distribution look like and then what we are we seeing with COVID-19. So, the first thing I would say is, what we have shown in this quarter is a great ability to execute. Our plan had always been to get to day one, within 90 days or so from close and we effectively did that.  And so it\u2019s a little bit out. But we in all the adversity, we had to relearn a lot of things, many companies did and we\u2019ll still pull this off. And today, a vast majority of all distribution points already are cobranded or branded as T-Mobile and we are often running going forward. Like many retailers, there wasn\u2019t a issue, right, when our retail sat down and we had to keep our employees safe, keep consumers safe and put the right protocol in place.  Our team has well worked very, very quickly to be fixed and take care of customers. And we saw some changes in buying traffic, switching from retail into digital. Now historically T-Mobile hasn\u2019t relied heavily on digital. Sprint relied a little bit more and then number increased a lot, but it was a very small percent and increased by lot and it\u2019s still a relatively small percent.  I\u2019d say those numbers have been generally stable as well, as we recovered we\u2019ve gone and been able to open the vast majority of the stores in a safe way to serve customers and the communities and the market is open back up. The trends has, what I\u2019d say generally stabilized. We do intend over time like many folks to serve customers where they want to get served, that\u2019s digital, that\u2019s full digital.  What we\u2019ve seen a lot of at times, is customers start digital and then fulfill on retail and we are fully set up to support that and we are going to continue to support that as move forward. \nMike Sievert: Another way of saying that and one of the reasons why we don\u2019t break down digital is that, and I know it sounds a little cakey, Mike, but, all of our customers come in through digital. And all of our customers nearly come in through retail. So, in other words, their hybrid approach is almost everyone deeply researches a rate plan and many start a cart, some finish a cart.  Even the ones that come through pure digital, the majority of those get some kind of human touch shortly thereafter. So it\u2019s a hybrid model and that hybrid model to your point is changing. It\u2019s not changing in a way that\u2019s going to bring material changes to our financials any time soon, because, right now anyway customers expect a human interaction at some point in the process and I hope that changes over time.  But as long as they do, that\u2019s where our people shine. And our people are just we won J.D. Power again. We just won the highest scores ever in the history of J.D. Power for customer care. So human interactions are real source of strength of ours and even digital customers benefit from it.  The last part of your question was about retail rationalization, about the store counts, about our reach. I can tell you that, I\u2019ll go to Jon Freier, if he is on the audio line just for a quick comment because he really engineered our Head of Consumer Markets engineered this day one with so much coordination with our communications group, our marketing group, our product and technology groups, our engineering groups.  But Jon has led the go to market approach and we\u2019ve simultaneously reached more people as T-Mobile now with a deeper population reach of retail than ever before. While going faster on store rationalization that people expected. Do you want to share a couple of those stats, Jon? \nJon Freier: Hey everybody. Yes, it has been an incredible last 90 to 120 days and like Mike said just a few moments ago, we got a unified operation behind the T-Mobile brand. And what that really means guys is that, no matter if you are going into a legacy T-Mobile store or a legacy Sprint store, the answer is, yes, we can help you.  And what we did here is, we took the legacy T-Mobile systems and installed them into our legacy Sprint stores and then we took the legacy Sprint systems and installed them into our legacy T-Mobile stores. We rebranded everything. So if you are driving around and public see these banners, that say Sprint now part of T-Mobile, so we got the Sprint exterior signs down, the new banner is up and there will be permanent T-Mobile signage that we will be following over the next several weeks and months.  But what we wanted to do is, be able to put customers in a position to say, yes, we can help you. No matter if you are coming into the store that you\u2019ve always come into or maybe you are coming into a store that\u2019s more convenient to you now. And we are in a position where, yes, we are not sending it from this store to that store, but we can help you at all of that.  So, we\u2019ve done an extraordinary amount of training, lots of system work, from a product and technology teams and our team has been in a great spot to do that. And like Mike said just a few moments ago, not only simultaneously reducing some overlap stores, as you guys know, we talked about this that we\u2019ve had stores that just have really run on top of one another and of course you are going to rationalize that, optimize that, as you need to.  But at the same time, we have exceeded presence. We actually have 10 million more covered parts across the country that we are expanding to. So that 275 million people that we are distributing to, prior to close, that was about 265 million. And so, there were places in the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes for example, where our distribution reach wasn\u2019t as great, but the Sprint distribution reach was really \u2013 was really there.  And so, we\u2019ve been able to dip those synergies and get all that behind this, get more locations to serve more customers, but our team is in position to be able to help new customer advance on the T-Mobile platform and then also take care of our Sprint branded customers until they migrate to the T-Mobile platform over the next sort of years.  So, I am super proud of what our teams accomplished. It\u2019s been an amazing \u2013 I am not of working like both what Mike and Matt said us few moments ago in this environment. It\u2019s really thrilled with what our teams have done. So, appreciate the time, Mike. \nMike Sievert: It looks to us at the beginning of this, like we reach about 275 million people with our distribution now, while going faster than expected on retail rationalization. So it\u2019s a win on both fronts, really terrific. Congratulations, John. Operator, let\u2019s go back to the phones. \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. \nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much, Good evening. Mike, I think, at last call you talked about some early wins in enterprise. I wonder if you could just pull back more broadly and just think about where you see the biggest sort of themes of opportunity.  You had a lot of color around the areas where you saw you could make progress as a standalone T-Mobile. Now you are combined with Sprint. Where do you think the best opportunities to take share are over the next couple of years with the new network? \nMike Sievert: Yes, terrific. I love the fact that we are a wireless pure play with the highest capacity in the history of the wireless industry in our plan. And because that\u2019s ultimately to our advantage. Enterprises, they have a complex know you solution providers from the biggest companies in the world and what they want from our industry is a high capacity connection at a great value and to surround around that with an easy to manage set up.  And we need to be the best at doing business within this category. So we are very focused on being the winning pure play. Mike Katz and his team have done a phenomenal job. Mike got out of the gates very quickly in this merger and had his day one weeks ago with our T-Mobile for business team integrating our go to market against enterprises, public sector opportunities, et cetera.  I mentioned in my remarks that, T-Mobile for business led the way. We had to update you mid quarter on our guidance and then we just updated you again that we beat the high end of the range of our guidance. Both of those were largely, but not entirely due to some outstanding opportunities to serve businesses public sector and schools for example in this rapidly changing landscape.  Customers have reached out to us and said, hey we need help. We need a great deal. We need a high capacity service for kids. But we talked a lot in our Project 10 million about the home work gap that you recall. But that\u2019s translated. Now it\u2019s a school work gap. And it\u2019s all day, it\u2019s not just home work and T-Mobile has the capacity to serve and that\u2019s just phenomenal.  So, Mike, if you are on the line, would you want to say anything else about the opportunities ahead? \nMike Katz : Yes. No. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think you are exactly right. I know I mentioned last earnings that we are in this really interesting time in the middle of COVID and then as we come out of COVID, as companies are doing their long-term planning and maybe even thinking about possible recession that we are seeing buying happening in this category at a faster rate than we typically would have seen, rather for then companies waiting three, four, five years to buy this category.  It\u2019s happening faster. The timelines are too pressed. And that\u2019s created huge opportunity for us where in many enterprises we are not the incumbent and our teams have just done an incredible job finding that demand from customers and backing it.  But at the end of the day, like Mike said, it really is about the network and the network that we have in the ground today and the things that we are doing that Neville and Mike talked about a second ago, really are going t be the difference maker for us because, businesses and government agencies first look at the network.  They look at our technical compliance we all fit to their standards and then they pick us based on all the other things that we do. And right now, we are able to meet all those demands from customers and we are now differentiating the network, not just a me too proposition like our competitors. So\u2026 \nSimon Flannery: COVID will close customers who may be look to switch carriers more aggressively to get a better price performance. \nMike Sievert: Yes. I think and we\u2019ve seen some signs of that. Many companies out there are looking at their long-term customers and they are going to do cost transformation programs as they prepare to maybe weather the post-COVID storm. And we\u2019ve seen lots of examples that companies \u2026. I mean, this marks kind of hiding the dynamic going on in American companies, which is everybody is looking for dollars and looking under every rock to find them.  And here we are and just that moment, with the best value and the highest capacity service. So that\u2019s really exciting. The last word I\u2019ll say, on this which is also a little bit COVID-related is, the CL, corporate liable part of our market is kind of been flat lined for a long time. And I actually think that post-COVID, there is an opportunity that the changing work styles will cause us to see growth again in that sectors, just at the time we are arriving with hyper competitiveness and able to lead the pack.  So, and the reason for that is simple, some form of home work and home officing is going to continue and some amount of that will carry on and companies will feel more of a need than in the past to take responsibility for some of the home connectivity and personal connectivity of their employees. That means enterprise corporate liable lines maybe positively responsive to this environment. That\u2019 always been a castle of AT&T\u2019s and Verizon\u2019s. But it\u2019s us to take and we are scaling the walls. \nSimon Flannery: Right. Thank you. \nMike Sievert: Thanks, Simon. \nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. \nCraig Moffett : Hi, thanks. You reported in the release that you\u2019ve converted about 10% of customers over to the T-Mobile \u2013 Sprint customers over to the T-Mobile network and that\u2019s really sort of brings back memories of the way you manage the metro PCS merger some years ago.  I wonder if you can just contrast those two, maybe particularly with Neville and talk about what\u2019s different this time in trying to integrate particularly the 2.5 Ghz spectrum what you did in the metro PCS merger which was effectively running off a network and then moving over this spectrum. And just how that should inform the way we think about the cadence of the synergy realization here? \nMike Sievert: Neville, do you want to jump in?\nNeville Ray: Happy to take it. Hey Craig. So the situations are comparable, but they are different and favorably, so, I think the biggest \u2013 the other is that, as we look to metro PCS, I mean that was primarily a CDMA customer base. And so, we have different technologies and we knew we have to retire and move all of those customers out of the CDMA phone effectively.  Here we are with combining our traffic and our customer bases across Sprint and T-Mobile. On the update today Mike mentioned in the opening remarks 85% of the Sprint customer base have a compatible phone with the T-Mobile network.  So that 10% traffic number which is remarkable in a very short period of time. It\u2019s there because we can start open a network customer just on LTE, our Sprint customers have access to that great nationwide 4G now too. But because they have compatible LTE handsets and we\u2019ve activated and we are moving through VoLTE very quickly, which is the primary voice bearer for us.  It\u2019s not we are competing on different technology, as it was with metro. We can move those customers at much faster pace. And so, I am always hopeful and confident now that we can move through the migration of traffic and ultimately spectrum and then move to decommissioning at a faster pace. I mean, that\u2019s the game plan.  And as I said earlier we are furiously building out the network capability to house that spectrum, the 2.5 Ghz that we have a huge volume of, as you know, Craig. And as we do that, we can support more and more traffic and start to ultimately migrate these customers across.  Very similar playbook in many ways in terms of how we approach it, but we are in a much better place to move faster, because of the handset compatibility. \nCraig Moffett : One follow-up to the previous question about the enterprise segment. What do you plan to do with the wire line network from Sprint?\nMike Sievert: The competition and post- integration \u2013 are there any strategic acquisitions you are interested into accelerate though. Obviously, and I knew this asking, it\u2019s not that I can address directly, but I can tell you this, and I said it a little bit earlier, I like being a pure play. I like being, we are focused and we are disciplined.  And that\u2019s going to be one of the ways that we win. Wireless is where things are going. You\u2019ve heard us say, John Ledger said for years, you\u2019ve heard us say over and over, all content in communications of all kind of leading their linear forms and going to the internet and the internet is going mobile. Mobile is heating the internet. And so, as a mobile pure play, that\u2019s a great place to be.  Now, on the other side of it, I\u2019ll just say, while we are focused and disciplined we have a fantastic balance sheet. And an incredible source of Sprint and so, we won\u2019t be at choose to strategic opportunities if they make sense in our business model. But I think you are investing in this company, because you see that we have an opportunity to win in this huge market and we intend to focus and to do just that. And operator, why don\u2019t we do go to the phone? \nOperator: Thank you. And it looks like our next one is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Your line is open. \nJonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Thanks guys. Great quarter. One for Mike and one for Neville. So, Mike, or maybe if Peter. Were there any synergies captured in 2Q or is it too early? And then, how much of this is \u2013 what are you assuming for synergy capture in the second half guidance? And this one is definitely for Michael.  The $43 billion, you said a few times that you expect it to be higher, is that just from acceleration or the synergy number or the EBITDA number in year would be larger than you initially thought it would be? And then for Neville, when you get to fulfills on the 5G deployment, how many \u2013 where does that 700 sites per week goes to? Thanks. \nMike Sievert: You heard \u2013 I\u2019ll have Peter comment on the first one. You heard in my remarks that, we moved faster than expected on so many elements of integration in the second quarter and you saw us flow the cost through for some of those things. And then, yes, that does allow us to start to see some runrate synergy impacts from those moves.  I also said that that sets us up well to invest in the next round. So, you have to kind of keep it in balance, because the bigger pieces to the earlier discussion are still in front of us. The actual operational integration spending was pretty light in Q2. You will see benefit of it flow in, but that benefit is really allowing us to move to the next base in the round of bases and swing again.  And so, in 2020 and 2021, these are big investment years and it\u2019s important we start to get some of that runrate to flow in, because that actually helps to fund us as we go along. So, I think I kind of captured that in my remarks, but, Peter, why don\u2019t you add to that and then tackle the other? \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely, Mike. So, there is no doubt, right, with the long incumbency of the deal, as well as COVID-19, right, it\u2019s a differential that\u2019s put out there almost two years ago, but we do remain highly confident in our ability to exceed and to your point, Mike, yes the moves that we made in Q2, you saw us accelerate and diligently do things and we put the 8-K out there both from organizational design acceleration, this phone rationalization acceleration.  You see what the pace of the 2.5 rollout did, which is again the first step of the three and ultimately leads to the decommissioning which is the biggest part of the synergies \u2013 avoided site builds already, that\u2019s already something that we are capturing. And so, yes, in the second half of the year, we are already going to be capturing some synergies and that\u2019s then only build them through the investment periods.  And again, as Mike said, I think we are quarter into this journey. It\u2019s a multi-year journey where a quarter in we are already seeing optimistic signs and we are moving quickly what\u2019s prudent to do so. And we do owe you an update on that as soon as we can we will. \nMike Sievert: And I hope you hear us saying, and we are laying down some facts to back it up now that our aspiration is to go faster and bigger. And, look, I think ultimately you are going to measure our team, based on three simple things. Did we outgrow the competition through this first timing cycle as a new company? Did we unlock the synergies bigger and faster than we promised and translate that to enterprise value? And did we set up the company for long-term success? And this management team is laser-focused on all. \nNeville Ray: Jonathan on the back-end of your question there on the runrate, obviously we are going to do better than the 700 per week. But I am delighted with that ramp during the pandemic. So, the great news is, we\u2019ve got great resources out there working very safely and with health and safety paramount. Our supply chain is actually really robust.  We had a few scarce in the early days of the pandemic, but as things are moving really well. And I want to get into a nice robust steady state and go build this network out as we said over the next two years. I will really want to break of the back of the 2.5 deployment over the next 18 months.  I mean, that\u2019s the plan and we have a runrate and a production rate that network factory now is rolling out operates and incremental site activity on a very, very strong site. So we are in a good spot. \nJonathan Chaplin : Thank you guys \nMike Sievert: I am going to step out right now. But we are going to take one last question and then, Peter will wrap us up. So, from my part, thank you for this great discussion. This was a phenomenal quarter and operator, the last question please?\nOperator: Our last one comes from Peter Supino from Bernstein. Your line is open. \nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you had any insights on Sprint subscriber churn and I know that COVID-19 makes it hard to separate the drivers of changes in churn. But do you see anything about the way Sprint subscribers are interacting with the network that gives you a quantitative sense of how their experience might be changing? Thanks\nMatt Staneff: Hey, Peter. It\u2019s Matt. I\u2019ll start and then if Neville wants to jump in on any other factors there. So, we haven\u2019t seen anything that surprised us and we feel great of what we have in Q2 in terms of subscriber churn for Sprint. We\u2019ve seen lots of positive signs.  We\u2019ve been able to rapidly enable roaming and the ability for Sprint customers to get access to the T-Mobile network and we\u2019ve seen noticeable declines in churn rates from those customers who have gotten on the network, which is partly why we are going very fast at getting a build out done, or we are very happy about the handset compatibility and why we are aggressively moving fast at bringing those enhanced coverage experiences to Sprint customers.  We\u2019ve also seen great participation from the Sprint customer base into some of the offers and programs that T-Mobile traditionally have like T-Mobile Tuesdays or we have that for a number of years. It\u2019s a massive, it\u2019s a great platform for customers to just could thank every day for being a customer. It\u2019s an example of something we\u2019ve rolled out to Sprint customer base and we\u2019ve seen great adoption of that new customer and that\u2019s a very positive sign.  So we have an engaged customer base. Very excited about being a part of the T-Mobile company and what we have in front of us. And so, we are feeling very positive about where things are headed. All that said, we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to look when we come out of the suppression in Q2 from COVID.  We are watching that. Again, as Mike said earlier, we are planning for a highly competitive back half of the year. We are pushing forward getting to normal. We need to buy systems. So we can really take share in the marketplace. \nNeville Ray: I just add to [Indiscernible] this access to the T-Mobile network for the Sprint customer base is absolutely key. I mean, we know the coverage churn was a major concern in the Sprint base. And you\u2019ve heard our numbers today. I mean, 10 million customers every day are now accessing the T-Mobile network and that\u2019s everywhere, right.  It\u2019s not \u2013 this isn\u2019t kind of a roaming thing where it\u2019s just geographic expansion into rural environments. This is happening in building in Manhattan and Seattle. It\u2019s happening in urban cores, it\u2019s happening in suburban environments, as well as rural. Only about 35%, 40% of that traffic is actually in rural environments.  So, Sprint customers are already seeing a dramatic improvement in the coverage. We did that that they have closed. We opened up the networks for Sprint customers with compatible handsets which is the vast majority as we cover it. And so, big improvements in \u2013 that coverage experience has been a key. We are already starting to move towards looking customers over completely to a T-Mobile network experience.  We\u2019ve been very targeted without to make sure that customers on the Sprint side that had very difficult and challenging coverage situations, we\u2019ve moved some of those already completely over to T-Mobile network and there will be more of that obviously as we now ramp up our build spectrum migration and all of the activities we talked about today.  So, very pleased with the progress there and very positive signs in terms of the uptake from Sprint customers using rather T-Mobile network. With that I am going to.. \nPeter Supino: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. \nPeter Osvaldik: Well, thank you, Peter for the great question and thank you everybody for tuning in and we are really looking forward to continuing on this journey and speaking with you again next quarter. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Yes. No. Thanks, Mike. Yes, I think you are exactly right. I know I mentioned last earnings that we are in this really interesting time in the middle of COVID and then as we come out of COVID, as companies are doing their long-term planning and maybe even thinking about possible recession that we are seeing buying happening in this category at a faster rate than we typically would have seen, rather for then companies waiting three, four, five years to buy this category.  It's happening faster. The timelines are too pressed. And that's created huge opportunity for us where in many enterprises we are not the incumbent and our teams have just done an incredible job finding that demand from customers and backing it.  But at the end of the day, like Mike said, it really is about the network and the network that we have in the ground today and the things that we are doing that Neville and Mike talked about a second ago, really are going t be the difference maker for us because, businesses and government agencies first look at the network.  They look at our technical compliance we all fit to their standards and then they pick us based on all the other things that we do. And right now, we are able to meet all those demands from customers and we are now differentiating the network, not just a me too proposition like our competitors. So..."

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Alright. Thanks, Mike. I couldn't be more excited to lead as CFO during this critical time for the business. We have an incredible all star leadership team and I feel privileged to be working alongside each of you. We'll continue to execute on our proven playbook and unlocked incredible synergy potential of this merger for the years to come.  Before we get into the financial details, I wanted to cover off on a few points which lay the ground work for our reporting. First, we aligned the legacy Sprint and T-Mobile subscribers to our go forward new T-Mobile policies.  The net impact of these changes as outlined in more detail in our investor fact book and 10-Q resulted in a net reduction in total branded customers 14.1 million as of April 1, as compared to the standalone balances previously reported for Sprint and T-Mobile as of March 31.  The biggest adjustment was the removal of $9.2 million customers associated with the DISH divestiture including 963,000, which have been classified as postpaid phone customers in the previously reported Sprint figures. The adjustments also included approximately 40 million subscribers associated with reseller arrangements which were reclassified from postpaid to wholesale.  And recall, that we no longer report wholesale subscribers rather focusing on wholesale revenue. It is important to remember that these adjustments have more net impact on profitability. In addition, we are providing disclosures around the various impacts from purchase accounting and policy alignment in our 10-Q, but in the interest of time, I won't get into too much detail right now.  Okay. Now let's get into some of the financial details of the second quarter. Note that during this quarter, our pretax financial results were impacted by merger-related costs of $798 million, COVID-19-related costs of $341 million, as well as non-cash impairment charges of $418 million related to changes in our postpaid billing systems strategy and a strategic shift in product transport division enabled through the merger.  These costs are combined $1.56 billion before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Q2 net income of $110 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.09 were negatively impacted by these combined factors by $1.25 billion and $1.01 per share. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $7 billion, exceeding our guidance range.  Total service revenue of $13.2 billion was primarily driven by the merger, as well as continued customer growth, partially offset by a customated 1% to 2% headwind from COVID-19 related events. And note for the reported service revenues excluded this which was reflected in discontinued operations. Next quarter, the revenue from these customers will be reported in our wholesale service revenues.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $777 million, which includes $370 million for merger-related costs and $243 million for COVID-19 related costs. This includes the one-time impact of $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps on merger financing.  Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest of $119 million amounted to $2.3 billion. Free cash flow, excluding the settlement of interest rate swaps that I just mentioned was $1.4 billion, and recall for the swap, the net cash outflow was only $1.1 billion, as there was an inflow of $1.2 billion in cash flows from investing activities for the return of collateral previously provided.  Postpaid ARPA or Average Revenue Per Account amounted to 130.57 and postpaid phone ARPU was 47.99. In terms of customer quality, our results in the second quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic requirements of COVID-19.  Total bad debt expense and losses from sales of receivables was $263 million or 1.49 of total revenues. This includes approximately $46 million of incremental expense related to the FCC pledge that was excluded from adjusted EBITDA. If we normalize for this amount attributable to the FCC pledge, bad debt would have been 1.23% of revenues, in line with last quarter.  As we monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and the FCC pledge in our business, we are encouraged by some of the early trends. 95% of all accounts that took advantage of the pledge have made some form of payments since going on the field.  Notwithstanding high customer engagement and solid payment performance thus far, there is a small subset of FCC pledge customers that likely will not recover. As a result, our postpaid results for Q2 reflect an accrual of approximately 110,000 deactivations, including 90,000 postpaid phones as Mike mentioned, for customers that were still with us at the end of the quarter under the FCC pledge, but whom we expect will likely not pay off their remaining balances.  Shifting gears to our capital markets activity, in just one quarter as a combined company, we raised $27 billion including $4 billion of senior secured notes issued in June at an average yield of 2.16%, a debt neutral refinancing transaction in which the proceeds will be used to retire high yield debt in Q3, with an MPD benefit of approximately $400 million and record low average yield for our company, this deal was extremely well received and is a testament to the strength of our business and balance sheet.  And also, we delivered $20 billion secondary sale of SoftBank shares to the public and T-Mobile received a $300 million fee for facilitating the transaction in addition to being reimbursed for all expenses, just remarkable execution by the team in transactions that I am extremely proud of.  Okay. Let me now turn to our guidance, which we wanted to provide as we continue to prioritize transparency during uncertain times and when others across the industry have opted to provide little or no guidance compared to normal practice.  We are not immune to uncertainty either, but we recognize our unique situation as we provide you with the first set of combined results this quarter including the impacts of purchase price accounting and policy alignments and therefore we felt it was very important that we combine with best efforts guidance for the back half of 2020.  As always, we will continue to closely monitor consumer behavior, as well as economic environment related to the pandemic and how it may impact our second half results. New T-Mobile aspires to continue to lead the industry in postpaid growth and expect postpaid net customer additions between 1.7 million and 1.9 million, just a double click here of it, this guidance assumes higher postpaid phone net adds in the third and fourth quarters from what we saw in Q2 also while there was a tremendous opportunity to move quickly and win share of postpaid other devices as businesses and schools adapted during environments of remote working and learning, we expect to see a more balanced mix of postpaid phone versus other additions in the back half of the year.  We expect higher gross adds as industry churn levels increase both from typical higher seasonality and the muted churn effect in Q2 as a result of COVID-19. And we see this as an exciting opportunity as net share taker. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $12.4 billion to $12.7 billion for the back half of 2020 and includes leasing revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion.  We expect higher SG&A expenses in the second half, driven by higher selling expenses due to increased gross adds and the impact of close to $319 million of COVID-19 related costs which are excluded from adjusted EBITDA in Q2, moving back into normalized selling expenses.  Cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest are expected to be between $6.5 billion and $6.9 billion as we continue to build out America's largest 5G network, we expect CapEx to be relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 before ramping significantly in Q4. For the second half of 2020, merger and integration-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are expected to be $800 million to $1 billion before taxes and subject to our ability to go faster on integration.  While expenses in Q2 were primarily driven by severance and merger deal fees, we expect merger and integration-related cost in the second half to be primarily operational in focus. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger and integration-related costs, is expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.7 billion.  Free cash flow, including payments for merger and integration-related cost is expected to be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, impacted by the aforementioned merger cost and increased capital spending on the network.  And lastly, in the back half of 2020, our expected effective tax rate will be in the range of 31% to 33%, due primarily to certain non-deductible and merger-related cost incurred in the first half of the year that continue to impact the tax rate throughout 2020. However, we anticipate our future rate to be more in line with historical levels.  Now let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Yes, yes. Absolutely. And let me begin with, obviously, the second half guidance is also reflective of increased gross adds from SG&A, right. And that's both from a seasonal uptick that we expect as an industry in turn which is typical from Q3 to the second half, but also as a result of the COVID-19 cost, $300 million that were excluded in Q2 that again will become part of the normal runrate. And then, you have the leasing revenues, as you said, if you wanted to the core adjusted EBITDA. Yes. Absolutely, Brett. And as we said, what you saw in Q2, while there was an elevated amount of merger-related cost, there was a lot of transaction and then restructuring and severance, right from acceleration of some of those synergy opportunities. When we fled them to the second half, it is primarily, what I would call operational synergy capture now. So, that's when you think about the pace, that's an element to consider in there. And of course it's subject to us identifying ways to prudently go faster, which we are going to continue to do, just like you saw in Q2. Yes, absolutely, Mike. So, there is no doubt, right, with the long incumbency of the deal, as well as COVID-19, right, it's a differential that's put out there almost two years ago, but we do remain highly confident in our ability to exceed and to your point, Mike, yes the moves that we made in Q2, you saw us accelerate and diligently do things and we put the 8-K out there both from organizational design acceleration, this phone rationalization acceleration.  You see what the pace of the 2.5 rollout did, which is again the first step of the three and ultimately leads to the decommissioning which is the biggest part of the synergies \u2013 avoided site builds already, that's already something that we are capturing. And so, yes, in the second half of the year, we are already going to be capturing some synergies and that's then only build them through the investment periods.  And again, as Mike said, I think we are quarter into this journey. It's a multi-year journey where a quarter in we are already seeing optimistic signs and we are moving quickly what's prudent to do so. And we do owe you an update on that as soon as we can we will. Well, thank you, Peter for the great question and thank you everybody for tuning in and we are really looking forward to continuing on this journey and speaking with you again next quarter.

            "content": "Hey everybody. Yes, it has been an incredible last 90 to 120 days and like Mike said just a few moments ago, we got a unified operation behind the T-Mobile brand. And what that really means guys is that, no matter if you are going into a legacy T-Mobile store or a legacy Sprint store, the answer is, yes, we can help you.  And what we did here is, we took the legacy T-Mobile systems and installed them into our legacy Sprint stores and then we took the legacy Sprint systems and installed them into our legacy T-Mobile stores. We rebranded everything. So if you are driving around and public see these banners, that say Sprint now part of T-Mobile, so we got the Sprint exterior signs down, the new banner is up and there will be permanent T-Mobile signage that we will be following over the next several weeks and months.  But what we wanted to do is, be able to put customers in a position to say, yes, we can help you. No matter if you are coming into the store that you've always come into or maybe you are coming into a store that's more convenient to you now. And we are in a position where, yes, we are not sending it from this store to that store, but we can help you at all of that.  So, we've done an extraordinary amount of training, lots of system work, from a product and technology teams and our team has been in a great spot to do that. And like Mike said just a few moments ago, not only simultaneously reducing some overlap stores, as you guys know, we talked about this that we've had stores that just have really run on top of one another and of course you are going to rationalize that, optimize that, as you need to.  But at the same time, we have exceeded presence. We actually have 10 million more covered parts across the country that we are expanding to. So that 275 million people that we are distributing to, prior to close, that was about 265 million. And so, there were places in the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes for example, where our distribution reach wasn't as great, but the Sprint distribution reach was really \u2013 was really there.  And so, we've been able to dip those synergies and get all that behind this, get more locations to serve more customers, but our team is in position to be able to help new customer advance on the T-Mobile platform and then also take care of our Sprint branded customers until they migrate to the T-Mobile platform over the next sort of years.  So, I am super proud of what our teams accomplished. It's been an amazing \u2013 I am not of working like both what Mike and Matt said us few moments ago in this environment. It's really thrilled with what our teams have done. So, appreciate the time, Mike."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Matt Staneff",
            "content": "Yes. That's great. So, as Mike said, we are going to continue with past day one. Right now, we've got our new proposition in the market largely it's T-Mobile the way it was before. The one thing we do that we have a Sprint customer base and we are very aggressively taking care of those customers, now watching and managing their churn helping us. A lot of them are on lease upgrade offers. And so, what you can expect over time obviously is we are not going to take away seeing some customers that could potentially increase churn. We are going to continue to serve them. And so, that's part of what you see in the leasing mix as we got options available, the T-Mobile options that we are still going to take care of for customers. And so it will be kind of more of a gradual change in the total mix versus what we are doing for new customers with that. Yes. I'll start on churn. 80 bps that's a great number. It's a great number to have in the first quarter. Now that we are together and the comparison is accurate. T-Mobile was among the leaders in the category and as you said, Sprint was in the high ones. I think the last 42 close to 106 and down 180 basis points. One thing to consider is, this was done in Q2 when covered with the Q. And we said the switch in flows were down.  We were taking care of customers and then a collection - we've accounted for all of that. But Q2 is a bit of an anomaly and you've seen that across the industry in terms of what churn has done. We have been very hard at work. We've been talking about what we've done, getting the Sprint customer base access to the network. We've got 10 million customers kind of on a daily basis using the network.  We could provide VoLTE with a much better experience and we've been hard at work giving value to the Sprint customer base. And taking un-carrier principles and deploying them pretty broadly across the base. So we are not predicting where churn will go. And like just Peter said, seasonally it's going to be up a little bit and in the third quarter and we've put that into our guidance.  And I can't predict where churn will go, but what I can say is that things we need to get to where it was at 0.80 last quarter, we are going to keep doing and more of as we move forward. Yes. I'll tackle that, Mike. I think the question was a little bit around distribution look like and then what we are we seeing with COVID-19. So, the first thing I would say is, what we have shown in this quarter is a great ability to execute. Our plan had always been to get to day one, within 90 days or so from close and we effectively did that.  And so it's a little bit out. But we in all the adversity, we had to relearn a lot of things, many companies did and we'll still pull this off. And today, a vast majority of all distribution points already are cobranded or branded as T-Mobile and we are often running going forward. Like many retailers, there wasn't a issue, right, when our retail sat down and we had to keep our employees safe, keep consumers safe and put the right protocol in place.  Our team has well worked very, very quickly to be fixed and take care of customers. And we saw some changes in buying traffic, switching from retail into digital. Now historically T-Mobile hasn't relied heavily on digital. Sprint relied a little bit more and then number increased a lot, but it was a very small percent and increased by lot and it's still a relatively small percent.  I'd say those numbers have been generally stable as well, as we recovered we've gone and been able to open the vast majority of the stores in a safe way to serve customers and the communities and the market is open back up. The trends has, what I'd say generally stabilized. We do intend over time like many folks to serve customers where they want to get served, that's digital, that's full digital.  What we've seen a lot of at times, is customers start digital and then fulfill on retail and we are fully set up to support that and we are going to continue to support that as move forward. Hey, Peter. It's Matt. I'll start and then if Neville wants to jump in on any other factors there. So, we haven't seen anything that surprised us and we feel great of what we have in Q2 in terms of subscriber churn for Sprint. We've seen lots of positive signs.  We've been able to rapidly enable roaming and the ability for Sprint customers to get access to the T-Mobile network and we've seen noticeable declines in churn rates from those customers who have gotten on the network, which is partly why we are going very fast at getting a build out done, or we are very happy about the handset compatibility and why we are aggressively moving fast at bringing those enhanced coverage experiences to Sprint customers.  We've also seen great participation from the Sprint customer base into some of the offers and programs that T-Mobile traditionally have like T-Mobile Tuesdays or we have that for a number of years. It's a massive, it's a great platform for customers to just could thank every day for being a customer. It's an example of something we've rolled out to Sprint customer base and we've seen great adoption of that new customer and that's a very positive sign.  So we have an engaged customer base. Very excited about being a part of the T-Mobile company and what we have in front of us. And so, we are feeling very positive about where things are headed. All that said, we don't know how that's going to look when we come out of the suppression in Q2 from COVID.  We are watching that. Again, as Mike said earlier, we are planning for a highly competitive back half of the year. We are pushing forward getting to normal. We need to buy systems. So we can really take share in the marketplace."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes. I mean, thanks, Mike. I mean, we are moving at an incredible pace. I mean, I could not be more pleased with the progress that we've made in what's a few short weeks since we combined with the Sprint team. And it's on two fronts, I mean, we've been rapidly accelerating the breadth of this network, if I talk to the 250 million people now covered the T-Mobile's low band 5G, 327 million of people covered with LTE too, right, and we are closing in on that opportunity for in our 5G footprint.  So, that gives us the breadth. The depth comes from the 2.5 Ghz spectrum, the mid band slice that's so important. And all I can say is, we are baking that cake super, super fast. So, to give you some idea and dimension that for you, I mean, as we get to the second quarter, every week, we were starting up great activity on about 600 sites per week.  In the last month, that number has gone to 700 sites per week. So, you can all do that math that thousands of sites in a month and in the quarter and we are running very, very hard of having that mid-band layer of the network to this great opportunity. Mike outlined the experience and the speeds.  To the earlier question about, 5G phones in fourth quarter, and we have a great line-up today, lots of great phones, great news from Samsung just the other day announced and we want to make sure that there is really only one 5G network that you would love to put a 5G phone on. And it's from T-Mobile.  The coverage is spotting your best from AT&T, nascent from Verizon and when you can combine great coverage with great performance and speed with mid band inside the fourth quarter, that's going to be a complete game changer. So, great quarter. Great numbers.  But we are only just getting started with this network roll out and the pace is phenomenal. Mike outlined, obviously, we are not building in all the places, but standalone T-Mobile and Sprint would have planned to and that's good for this business, right. We are starting to generate those cost avoidance, site avoidance synergies at pace, real pace in the second half of this year and we'll talk to those numbers more as we close out 2020. But tremendous progress underway and I couldn't be happy of.  Tower guys not so happy. We could be doing some more with the tower guys, but there is a competitive process in play right now and we have choices that we can make. So, I would fully anticipate that we will start more tower build as we move into the second half, but to be seen. That doesn't slow us down. We have lots of options to build and we are building furiously. Happy to take it. Hey Craig. So the situations are comparable, but they are different and favorably, so, I think the biggest \u2013 the other is that, as we look to metro PCS, I mean that was primarily a CDMA customer base. And so, we have different technologies and we knew we have to retire and move all of those customers out of the CDMA phone effectively.  Here we are with combining our traffic and our customer bases across Sprint and T-Mobile. On the update today Mike mentioned in the opening remarks 85% of the Sprint customer base have a compatible phone with the T-Mobile network.  So that 10% traffic number which is remarkable in a very short period of time. It's there because we can start open a network customer just on LTE, our Sprint customers have access to that great nationwide 4G now too. But because they have compatible LTE handsets and we've activated and we are moving through VoLTE very quickly, which is the primary voice bearer for us.  It's not we are competing on different technology, as it was with metro. We can move those customers at much faster pace. And so, I am always hopeful and confident now that we can move through the migration of traffic and ultimately spectrum and then move to decommissioning at a faster pace. I mean, that's the game plan.  And as I said earlier we are furiously building out the network capability to house that spectrum, the 2.5 Ghz that we have a huge volume of, as you know, Craig. And as we do that, we can support more and more traffic and start to ultimately migrate these customers across.  Very similar playbook in many ways in terms of how we approach it, but we are in a much better place to move faster, because of the handset compatibility. Jonathan on the back-end of your question there on the runrate, obviously we are going to do better than the 700 per week. But I am delighted with that ramp during the pandemic. So, the great news is, we've got great resources out there working very safely and with health and safety paramount. Our supply chain is actually really robust.  We had a few scarce in the early days of the pandemic, but as things are moving really well. And I want to get into a nice robust steady state and go build this network out as we said over the next two years. I will really want to break of the back of the 2.5 deployment over the next 18 months.  I mean, that's the plan and we have a runrate and a production rate that network factory now is rolling out operates and incremental site activity on a very, very strong site. So we are in a good spot. I just add to [Indiscernible] this access to the T-Mobile network for the Sprint customer base is absolutely key. I mean, we know the coverage churn was a major concern in the Sprint base. And you've heard our numbers today. I mean, 10 million customers every day are now accessing the T-Mobile network and that's everywhere, right.  It's not \u2013 this isn't kind of a roaming thing where it's just geographic expansion into rural environments. This is happening in building in Manhattan and Seattle. It's happening in urban cores, it's happening in suburban environments, as well as rural. Only about 35%, 40% of that traffic is actually in rural environments.  So, Sprint customers are already seeing a dramatic improvement in the coverage. We did that that they have closed. We opened up the networks for Sprint customers with compatible handsets which is the vast majority as we cover it. And so, big improvements in \u2013 that coverage experience has been a key. We are already starting to move towards looking customers over completely to a T-Mobile network experience.  We've been very targeted without to make sure that customers on the Sprint side that had very difficult and challenging coverage situations, we've moved some of those already completely over to T-Mobile network and there will be more of that obviously as we now ramp up our build spectrum migration and all of the activities we talked about today.  So, very pleased with the progress there and very positive signs in terms of the uptake from Sprint customers using rather T-Mobile network. With that I am going to.."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks Jud, and hi to everybody listening in or watching online. We are coming to you live and socially distanced from here in our Bellevue headquarters. So I am pleased that nice to be back in the office for once given if we are behind this huge flexi glass panels and sitting 10 feet apart. First of all, let me just say, thanks in advance for your patience, because my upfront remarks will be just a few minutes longer than usual today given that this is our first quarterly report for the new company and there is a lot to cover. I promise I am not filibuster. Q2 was our first quarter together and what a quarter it was. I am incredibly fired up about everything this new combined team has accomplished since we last spoke in May and I am more excited than ever about the future of T-Mobile.  We have already hit major milestones in record time and made significant progress on integration and we did it while achieving incredible business results for the quarter. We know, that very quarter our competitors were telling you we'd be too distracted by the merger to execute, yes, that's what. So let me start by saying this, we kicked off the quarter by achieving something nobody really thought possible just a short time ago.  Our total branded customer accounts surpassed AT&T, making us the number two player in wireless at the beginning of the quarter. This monumental milestone in U.S. wireless history was a historic achievement for all of us at T-Mobile. And even better we haven't looked back since. We have no intention of slowing down.  Our lead versus AT&T is even wider as we talk to you today. In Q2, T-Mobile once again led the industry in total branded customer growth for the 22nd consecutive quarter firmly establishing new T-Mobile as the leading growth company in the industry. Now with over 98 million customers at quarter end, we are steering down Verizon, but our site sat on the number one spot.  Despite the significant challenges we all face this quarter, in T-Mobile's case including combining with a much slower growth company in Sprint and continuing to deal with the global pandemic that led to a lower switching environment, this team adapted and delivered.  We didn't skip a beat that. In fact, we moved faster. We again led the industry at adding 1.2 million total branded customers across postpaid and prepaid in Q2, four and three times AT&T and Verizon combined. Total postpaid net additions were 1.1 million, also leading the industry and over three times more than Verizon who was the closest competitor. We actually got something of a formulator when trying to divide by a negative number for our AT&T comparison. And believe we grow that.  Needless to say, we are still competing aggressively and our team is having fun with it. And while we are on this topic, I do want to take this opportunity to recognize our T-Mobile core business team for really stepping up in a big way to help schools and businesses adapting to new remote learning and work challenges that are needed.  Most of our overperformance this quarter versus guidance on postpaid was in this area. We also delivered 253,000 postpaid phone net adds, beating the national carriers again for the 26th quarter in a row. And this is after taking a 90,000 unit postpaid customer disconnect approval related to the FCC's keeping Americans connected.  And not to be forgotten, we also delivered Q2 postpaid phone churn of 0.8%, prepaid churn of just 2.81%. I am particularly proud of the churn progress as we integrate the traditionally higher churning Sprint business.  Now lets' talk about how all of our teams' hard work and real-time adjustments to the rapidly changing market resulted in incredibly strong Q2 financial results. This includes adjusted EBITDA of $7.0 billion, which exceeded our guidance.  Our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik will share more on our financial results in a moment, but I'll just remind you that our formula is pretty simple. Investing in customers leads to customer growth which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, a lot of which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience.  It's a virtuous cycle that delivered all of our early success as the un-carrier and it will continue to propel us to our goal of being number one in customer choice and number one in customer starts. While delivering these accomplishments, we kicked off a huge list of accomplishments that positioned new T-Mobile to win.  Peter will share more details about our work in the market, but I just wanted to mention three big milestones. First, our team executed the largest dual tranche secondary offering in U.S. history, the sale of SoftBank's shares in T-Mobile and actually created a positive trading dynamic in our stock with the transaction.  We also fulfilled a major merger commitment when we closed our transaction with DISH to divest the Sprint Prepaid business. And we issued $4 billion of senior secured notes a weighted average interest rate of just 2.16% all three had super successful outcome.  On the customer side, we launched Connecting Heroes providing free smartphone service and 5G access to state and local non-profit first responder agencies nationwide. This was the second initiative in our 5G for good un-carrier announced this from last year following T-Mobile Connect the low price plan we launched ahead of schedule in Q1. The final part of that move, Project 10 Million will be coming very soon, so stay tuned.  And we unveiled our latest un-carrier move Scam Shield. Scams and robo calls are a huge customer pain and in fact they are the leading FCC complaint. So we put together the industry's most comprehensive solution for customers to help stop distributes. With Scam Shield we are helping protect T-Mobile natural by T-Mobile and Sprint customers \u2013 they can scammers for free, while AT&T and Verizon make customers paid for it by requiring a certain plan or phone or premium add-on.  This move clearly mattered to consumers, because this announcement drove massive social media engagement and the most press coverage we've received since our first un-carrier move way back in March of 2013. Unlike all un-carrier moves, Scam Shield is designed to change wireless for good. So I hope that AT&T and Verizon will step up to our challenge and join us in taking this problem a lot more serious.  And I can't forget to mention that T-Mobile's care team continues to break record. We just recently received the highest ever score recorded in our industry on the J.D. Power2020 Customer Care Survey taking home our sixth win in a row and the 20th time we've ranked highest among full service providers. Our team loves our customers and it shows.  Okay. I really just scratched the surface on what this team accomplished this past quarter, but I know you are all really interested in our talk books and that's of course integration. And the work we are doing to build big and build fast on synergy attainment.  Let's start with the network. This is a huge piece of our synergy realization. Neville and his team are full steam ahead. We've talked about the fact that our \u2013 that the biggest block of our synergies come from the network and that it's a three step process as we first light up the available Sprint spectrum on the new T-Mobile anchor network which second, creates the capacity to migrate the Sprint traffic over.  And then third, allows us to finally decommission the sites that aren't in the go forward. That of course takes time and amazingly decommissioning, the third step, our initial sites is already under \u2013 The network teams working and overdrive to migrate Spring postpaid traffic on to the T-Mobile network and it shows.  In fact, as of today, we have already moved more than 10% of this traffic before we've even started the customer migration. This is possible, because we now have more than 85% of Sprint postpaid phone base with devices that work on the T-Mobile network, something we made fully available right out of the gate.  So now, over 10 million Sprint postpaid customers on average are using the T-Mobile network every single day, plus the Sprint base historically had limited access to VoLTE, voice-over-LTE. But we already have roughly 75% of the Sprint postpaid base now enabled on VoLTE. So they are enjoying a better voice experience with simultaneous data. I hope those stats straight you as surprising and unprecedented, was they are.  We also officially unveiled our retail operations and unified our retail operations and rebranded thousands of Sprint stores to T-Mobile stores last Sunday. This is an important milestone for our business and while we did it, we also rolled out the needed tools and systems across our distribution footprint to allow us to serve both legacy bases of postpaid customers in all T-Mobile stores.  Let me be clear, this was a massive lift. I just can't say enough that how our team flawlessly nailed this effort and executed incredibly fast. This would have been a major accomplishment even outside of a pandemic, it was really amazing to see all of that come to life during these complicated times.  And since the bringing two big brands like T-Mobile and Sprint together only comes around once we want it to market in true un-carrier fashion by doing something really big for our customers. So we launched four for hundred. Yes, four lines of the industry's best unlimited for $25 each per month. This is possibly our most ambitious consumer promotion ever and it includes 5G access.  Remember, the other guys maybe charging extra for 5G, ours includes it. Now to be clear, this is a limited time promotion to celebrate and build awareness for the newly integrated brand but even after it's done. We'll find out our ways to compete. We said we bring the competition with this merger and I hope we've addressed any lingering questions on that front.  I've said it before and I'll say it again. We are here to show customers that they no longer have to choose between the best value and the best network with T-Mobile, they'll get full. Our teams also been working hard to rapidly deliver T-Mobile benefits to legacy Sprint customers and they are loving all the un-carrier goodness like having access to the same great unlimited plans without future step ups. And perks like T-Mobile Tuesdays.  Well the synergies we are starting to see are not just for our investors, our customers are winning big too. At the same time, we are focused on evolving our organization structure and design to become one team that will be more efficient and more effective with clear roles and responsibilities for our employees that will help us all move faster and deliver results for the business.  This was a process that we originally expected to take 12 to 18 month, but we nearly completed in just one quarter and we felt it was important to do so. And, we are hiring. We've double down in areas that are focused on better serving our customers today and in the future by kicking off our un-carrier jobs initiative, add 5,000 new positions in just the first 12 months alone.  We also accelerated the rationalization of hundreds of retail stores, work that we originally planned to do over several quarters and we consolidated and began to adjust our marketing spend well ahead of schedule. These actions in Q2 alone are beginning to unlock significant synergies now, setting us up financially to be able to make investments throughout 2020 and next year and ultimately unlocking future synergies on a net basis.  Last time I told you I was even more confident in our synergy plans than I was before the merger. I just \u2013 I hope now you understand why. We are executing lightening fast. We said we would, but now we've laid down a ton of track, thus, based on the quick action we've taken, I am confident in our ability to not only deliver $43 billion in synergies like we previously talked about, but potentially unlock even more than originally planned and to do it all faster than planned.  Now let me just say a few words about one of my favorite topics, our rapidly expanding network. In the 5G race, T-Mobile is pulling way ahead. In the past few years, we've heard a lot of competitive \u2013 in marketing speak when it comes to 5G, all talk, and most of it is just higher. AT&T and Verizon don't want you see what's becoming so painfully obvious. T-Mobile is miles ahead of both of them and we are quickly pulling away from the past.  But instead of taking my word forward or Verizon's or AT&T's for that matter, let's just take a look at few actionable facts. Nobody disputes that we have America's largest 5G network and the competition isn't even close. Just this week, we had a major breakthrough when we launched standalone 5G. Now, our 5G network reaches over 250 million people, and 1.3 million square miles.  We now offer coverage across all 50 states and Puerto Rico on 5G. This geographic coverage is roughly double AT&T's and exponentially higher than Verizon. But it's not just our reach that matters. It's the experience our customers have on our network too that differentiates T-Mobile's 5G from the other wireless players.  Verizon, as you know, likes to spend a lot of time telling you that they have a real 5G, but its 5G is all about ultra wide band or a millimeter win. But again, let's put the facts on the table. T-Mobile customers with 5G handsets already have faster average speeds in more places than Verizon customers with 5G handsets. And we are just getting started lighting up our mid-band.  We are already lighting it up in 2.5 GHz in major metros including New York, Houston, Los Angeles, Dallas, Washington DC and Atlanta. And by the end of the year, customers will find mid-band 5G in thousands of cities and towns across the country.  At the end of this year, we are currently seeing average speeds north of 300 megabits per second, better than most home internet speeds and eight times faster than 4G LTE, but peak speeds of a gigabit. It will be even faster as we exit the year, plus a massive footprint. But even today, we have the advantage.  Take a look at open signal plays. T-Mobile customers have the best 5G availability meaning that un-carrier customers get a 5G signal more often than customers on any other network, that's two times more than AT&T's 5G and it is six times more than Verizon.  Not to mention, we go found that T-Mobile customers get a 5G signal in nearly four times more cities than Verizon and AT&T combined. By the way, Verizon would also like to excitedly tell you that in that same Ookla test, they have the fastest 5G speed scores, but they often forget to also mention that you can only find their 5G 0.4% of the time.  And maybe they'll deliver nationwide 5G coverage some day, but they'll beg, borrow and steal from their LTE networks to claiming the tools like dynamic spectrum sharing will overcome their spectrum shortage. When you get to what's real about 5G, T-Mobile's network is demonstrably ahead of the competition even as we just start pouring on the gas.  And it's now clear to most observers that it takes all circumvents to build a real 5G network, and our strategy to use 600 MHz low band as the foundation for 5G, something we had planned for years in advance was the right move to make. But it also shows just how well positioned we are to take share in the 5G era that everyone is now talking about.  T-Mobile controls 319 MHz of combined low and mid band spectrum on average nationwide. That's more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We also have more millimeter wave spectrum than AT&T and get this, we already have as many 5G devices on our network as AT&T and Verizon combined. This is a huge advantage for us as 5G becomes more prevalent for businesses and consumers.  All of our brands will benefit from a robust 5G network and according to the facts on the ground, T-Mobile customers are already taking advantage of how quickly we lit up that 600 MHz footprint. And the work we've already begun to do to rapidly increase capacity and boost speeds with the second layer of our 5G layer gig, our deep 2.5Ghz spectrum Honestly, I don't think I could be more excited about the progress we've made on this network and what we are building every single day. The fastest President Neville will tell us more about all of this when he gets his first question almost regardless of the question he actually gets asked.  As the gross leader in wireless, we are poised to bring an even more capable un-carrier to even more customers in more places. We are building the best network and offering the best value and that's what's super charging the un-carrier is all about. We've set the stage for a strong second half by delivering powerful Q2 results.  But as you know, we are not stopping there. I really believe that as the 5G era finally gets underway at scale later this year, this is our moment. We are way ahead. We have the strongest assets and we have what will very quickly become the demonstrably superior network in the U.S. combined with the un-carriers brand DNA. That's a powerful combination that our competitors will struggle to match and that will translate into results.  Okay. Now I am going to ask our new CFO, Peter Osvaldik to take us through the financials and our guidance. Most of you know Peter. Prior to taking this role, Peter was already a huge contributor to our outstanding results. He serves for years as our Chief Accounting Officer and number two Financial Officer, participating in every major financial decision that we make.  And like me, he knows what it's like to have big shoes to fill and his transition to the CFO role has been seamless. It comes at an important time for our business. So I am thrilled to have him in the role and Peter, take it away. And operator, I would like to just point out that in honor of Rich Greenfield and everybody at light shed, we will only be taking questions this quarter from people that begin their question with a phrase, great quarter guys. Just kidding. Operator. Peter, why don't you start? And it's really, it's really about backing out the lease revenues. If you want to look at what kind of \u2013 what we call core EBITDA, not so much for yield. Yes, the way we use to operate, right. Nothing has really changed in terms of how we think about this stuff, right. So, we have adjusted EBITDA and then you have leasing and lease revenues get backed out, to get to this more operational view, adjusted EBITDA is what we focus on and guide on those. So it's important that you understand that and obviously bringing in Sprint, there is a much bigger leasing component. And so the differences between the two are greater, now that we've merged. Yes, I mean, I'll start and I'll ask Matt Staneff to jump in. Phil, it's not that we didn't like it. It's that our view is that, it hasn't always been demonstrated to add to enterprise value. And because the customer satisfaction isn't there and then you cost later on as a result. So, but it's a tool in the toolkit. We've always done some of it.  I think, it depends on how it's done and we are open to it. The guide doesn't necessarily imply any big change, obviously. So, leasing revenues come from the runrate that is informed by the customers already in the base. But, Matt, other thoughts about financing in general and how we think about it? What we'll do over \u2013 but right now, as you know, we ask a one and therefore our main go to market for us to center ground. But we have all these tens of millions of Sprint customers and a lot of them make like leasing in one another lease device and we are happy to provide that. So, see that level. Thanks, Phil. Understood. Matt, do you want to start on churn? And not to mention in addition, but the legacy T-Mobile side of things, which will be increasingly difficult for us, I am back for you because we are past day one now and where business going forward. But, the legacy T-Mobile's side had a blockbuster low churn number. And so, blended in that also helps. So this is really gratifying. We have tailwinds on churn over the medium and long haul, because we know what drives it.  We have seen this journey on the T-Mobile side from some of the highest churn in the industry to some of the best churn in the industry in its network. And where, I just got done talking at length about how no one is going to be able to catch us on network. So we are really excited and to Matt's point, seasonally this year, there are going to be two dynamics.  One, COVID-19, we think the impacts of it will start to abate which brings some normalcy back into the suppression this quarter, as well as what's normal T-Mobile which is a seasonal uptick in the second half, all in against the backdrop of real exciting tailwinds. So, that's the first piece.  And the second piece you asked about was, kind of how to think about the second half and I will say, we have burdened our plan with the activations, we think are necessary to deliver the growth that we guided. And that means, we know that gross activations will up in the second half, why I just told you that seasonally and due to COVID, churn will be up and we'll outrun that churn and the other guy's churn will be up and that's an opportunity for us.  When the other guy's churn goes up a little bit, that's when we compete. You asked about phones. I don't know. I can't comment about phones. I really hope there is a well rounded 5G phone portfolio as we exit the year. And so, I'll just leave it there and if there is, that would be a great competitive moment for us. So, hopefully, that helps, John. Yes. Let me start and then ask Neville to comment. First of all, I love the fact that some of the tower companies that are out there sort of spreading some disinformation about our pace. I just got them tell you we are in all the biggest cities in the country with 2.5Ghz 5G already. And we will be in thousands of cities and towns across this country as we exit this year with that layer gig.  So, we are \u2013 that's what where we'll be running really fast. Reason it feels tough over there at the tower companies is because both standalone T-Mobile and Sprint were planning on lots of new sites. Sprint for coverage and T-Mobile for capacity. New T-Mobile has synergies, that's called site avoidance and I know that's tough, if you are a tower company, because millions and billions of dollars of site avoidance are just the kinds of comments you are now hearing.  That doesn't affect our rate and pace we are going like crazy. And you are right, there is not only speed potential which is NPV accretive, but look, the faster we get out in front of the pack on the demonstrable customer provable network leadership, the more of the operating results start to give us the potential to start talking to you about the magnitude of synergies as well.  And the enterprise value created from outgrowing our competitors. So, Neville, why don't you tell us a little bit about the rate and pace, because I know that's on everybody's mind? And Peter, just very briefly on Brett's last part, he was asking about the operational spend and it was maybe, it sounded like it may have been a little less than he was expecting given the Q2 spend. Do you want to unpack that a little bit? Because I think that's some point people will understand. But in other words, operationally, it's rapidly growing in the second half. The operational component of our cost to achieve in Q2 is actually quite small. Most of it was deal-related transaction cost and so the \u2013 and it's all operational from here on. So, it's a big, big uptick in actual cost to achieve going through the system in the second half. Brett. Thanks a lot. Yes, nothing really has broadly changed in our aspirations and at some point by the way, you raised a good question, at some point I know what, we'll owe you an update on all that. We keep saying and I hopefully we backed it up with actual evidence and reasons why we are saying it today by giving you something to chew on.  But we keep saying, hey, we are more confident now. This two year old plan, we think it may be a little conservative. I know we owe you some more color on that, but let's say, we have one \u2013 exactly one data point for this company so far and that's today's report. So, we are going to get a little bit more a line established for you and then we'll give you a different updated way to think about the future. So, I know we owe you that. Okay. Thanks. Operator? Meanwhile Sorry, operator, who is next? Yes. You bet. And by the way I got so enamored with the second part. Tell me the first part again, what was the management Yes. So, listen, on pricing, revenues and ARPU and all that, one of the things you got, I think from our report was that we see a relatively stable outlook in the near-term. For competitors, I guess, didn't guide or give you much to go on, we felt with the new company it was important to us to just do a best efforts view and we don't see catalysts in the near-term for big changes one way or the other in ARPU.  Separately, you heard Peter start to talk about ARPA. And that we're looking at this at a household level, because we think there is, in the 5G era, there is all kinds of opportunities to develop deeper relationships with households that would be accretive to ARPA without necessarily affecting ARPU.  Thirdly, I'll say, our plan all along has been to bring a intense level of competition to this market like we have always done as the un-carrier, but now in a sustainable way backed by the long-term network plans that we have. And that's obviously going to be to the benefit of consumers and we funded that fully in our model.  How that relates to ARPU specifically and how that will unfold over the years, again, I know we have a two year old set of spots and at some point need to update that. But a few things to say. We are bringing competition into the market.  That's who we are. We've got the capacity to do it. It would be crazy not to leverage that capacity advantage to compete hard and grow top-line revenues through competition. So, that's number one. Number two, in the very near-term, we see no real catalyst one way or the other for ARPU changes. So we see it generally stable for the second half as we commented on. And then, Matt, do you want to jump into the second half? Another way of saying that and one of the reasons why we don't break down digital is that, and I know it sounds a little cakey, Mike, but, all of our customers come in through digital. And all of our customers nearly come in through retail. So, in other words, their hybrid approach is almost everyone deeply researches a rate plan and many start a cart, some finish a cart.  Even the ones that come through pure digital, the majority of those get some kind of human touch shortly thereafter. So it's a hybrid model and that hybrid model to your point is changing. It's not changing in a way that's going to bring material changes to our financials any time soon, because, right now anyway customers expect a human interaction at some point in the process and I hope that changes over time.  But as long as they do, that's where our people shine. And our people are just we won J.D. Power again. We just won the highest scores ever in the history of J.D. Power for customer care. So human interactions are real source of strength of ours and even digital customers benefit from it.  The last part of your question was about retail rationalization, about the store counts, about our reach. I can tell you that, I'll go to Jon Freier, if he is on the audio line just for a quick comment because he really engineered our Head of Consumer Markets engineered this day one with so much coordination with our communications group, our marketing group, our product and technology groups, our engineering groups.  But Jon has led the go to market approach and we've simultaneously reached more people as T-Mobile now with a deeper population reach of retail than ever before. While going faster on store rationalization that people expected. Do you want to share a couple of those stats, Jon? It looks to us at the beginning of this, like we reach about 275 million people with our distribution now, while going faster than expected on retail rationalization. So it's a win on both fronts, really terrific. Congratulations, John. Operator, let's go back to the phones. Yes, terrific. I love the fact that we are a wireless pure play with the highest capacity in the history of the wireless industry in our plan. And because that's ultimately to our advantage. Enterprises, they have a complex know you solution providers from the biggest companies in the world and what they want from our industry is a high capacity connection at a great value and to surround around that with an easy to manage set up.  And we need to be the best at doing business within this category. So we are very focused on being the winning pure play. Mike Katz and his team have done a phenomenal job. Mike got out of the gates very quickly in this merger and had his day one weeks ago with our T-Mobile for business team integrating our go to market against enterprises, public sector opportunities, et cetera.  I mentioned in my remarks that, T-Mobile for business led the way. We had to update you mid quarter on our guidance and then we just updated you again that we beat the high end of the range of our guidance. Both of those were largely, but not entirely due to some outstanding opportunities to serve businesses public sector and schools for example in this rapidly changing landscape.  Customers have reached out to us and said, hey we need help. We need a great deal. We need a high capacity service for kids. But we talked a lot in our Project 10 million about the home work gap that you recall. But that's translated. Now it's a school work gap. And it's all day, it's not just home work and T-Mobile has the capacity to serve and that's just phenomenal.  So, Mike, if you are on the line, would you want to say anything else about the opportunities ahead? Yes. I think and we've seen some signs of that. Many companies out there are looking at their long-term customers and they are going to do cost transformation programs as they prepare to maybe weather the post-COVID storm. And we've seen lots of examples that companies .... I mean, this marks kind of hiding the dynamic going on in American companies, which is everybody is looking for dollars and looking under every rock to find them.  And here we are and just that moment, with the best value and the highest capacity service. So that's really exciting. The last word I'll say, on this which is also a little bit COVID-related is, the CL, corporate liable part of our market is kind of been flat lined for a long time. And I actually think that post-COVID, there is an opportunity that the changing work styles will cause us to see growth again in that sectors, just at the time we are arriving with hyper competitiveness and able to lead the pack.  So, and the reason for that is simple, some form of home work and home officing is going to continue and some amount of that will carry on and companies will feel more of a need than in the past to take responsibility for some of the home connectivity and personal connectivity of their employees. That means enterprise corporate liable lines maybe positively responsive to this environment. That' always been a castle of AT&T's and Verizon's. But it's us to take and we are scaling the walls. Thanks, Simon. Neville, do you want to jump in? The competition and post- integration \u2013 are there any strategic acquisitions you are interested into accelerate though. Obviously, and I knew this asking, it's not that I can address directly, but I can tell you this, and I said it a little bit earlier, I like being a pure play. I like being, we are focused and we are disciplined.  And that's going to be one of the ways that we win. Wireless is where things are going. You've heard us say, John Ledger said for years, you've heard us say over and over, all content in communications of all kind of leading their linear forms and going to the internet and the internet is going mobile. Mobile is heating the internet. And so, as a mobile pure play, that's a great place to be.  Now, on the other side of it, I'll just say, while we are focused and disciplined we have a fantastic balance sheet. And an incredible source of Sprint and so, we won't be at choose to strategic opportunities if they make sense in our business model. But I think you are investing in this company, because you see that we have an opportunity to win in this huge market and we intend to focus and to do just that. And operator, why don't we do go to the phone? You heard \u2013 I'll have Peter comment on the first one. You heard in my remarks that, we moved faster than expected on so many elements of integration in the second quarter and you saw us flow the cost through for some of those things. And then, yes, that does allow us to start to see some runrate synergy impacts from those moves.  I also said that that sets us up well to invest in the next round. So, you have to kind of keep it in balance, because the bigger pieces to the earlier discussion are still in front of us. The actual operational integration spending was pretty light in Q2. You will see benefit of it flow in, but that benefit is really allowing us to move to the next base in the round of bases and swing again.  And so, in 2020 and 2021, these are big investment years and it's important we start to get some of that runrate to flow in, because that actually helps to fund us as we go along. So, I think I kind of captured that in my remarks, but, Peter, why don't you add to that and then tackle the other? And I hope you hear us saying, and we are laying down some facts to back it up now that our aspiration is to go faster and bigger. And, look, I think ultimately you are going to measure our team, based on three simple things. Did we outgrow the competition through this first timing cycle as a new company? Did we unlock the synergies bigger and faster than we promised and translate that to enterprise value? And did we set up the company for long-term success? And this management team is laser-focused on all. I am going to step out right now. But we are going to take one last question and then, Peter will wrap us up. So, from my part, thank you for this great discussion. This was a phenomenal quarter and operator, the last question please?"

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead sir.\nJud Henry: Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Braxton Carter, our CFO; and Neville Ray, our President Technology; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. Please note that, any comments on this call related to Q1 2020 results are referencing standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger with Sprint Corporation and all forward-looking statements refer to the combined post-merger company. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that include projections and statements about our future financial and operating results our plans, the benefits we expect to receive from our recently completed merger with Sprint, our business and operations in light of COVID-19 and other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current, beliefs and expectations of our management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control that could cause our actual results to differ materially, including the risk factors set forth in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed today. Reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results we discuss on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations page of our website. Let me now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Well, thanks a lot Jud, and thanks to everybody for joining in. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call coming to you live mostly from our living rooms and home offices and maybe a few kitchens across the country. And let me just start by saying, what a crazy quarter this was, and I think a really proud moment in history for our team. Over the last couple of months, we've closed one of the largest telecom mergers in history, after fighting for it for over two years. And we started by making immediate progress on our integration work to unlock the value of this combination. We transitioned our CEO office, we established a new leadership team for the company and we completely reinvented how we serve our customers, all during a global pandemic and all at an incredibly fast pace. And through it all we did it while posting some pretty fantastic business results, which is what we're here to talk with you about today. Okay. We've got a lot of ground to cover. I plan to share some early insights and thoughts about the New T-Mobile touch on the impacts of COVID-19, cover some highlights from Q1 and of course brag about some of those early wins that Neville and his team are already delivering on our network, including some really fast work the team has done to roll out our 2.5 gigahertz spectrum from Sprint in Philadelphia and in New York onto the T-Mobile network. Then Braxton will unpack the financials and we'll share some guidance for Q2. Amazingly, it's been just five weeks since finally closing our merger with Sprint and let me tell you, we're incredibly fired up about the opportunity ahead. While the process took way longer than anyone could have imagined, we took advantage of every moment during the approval process for this deal to plan for a rapid integration of these companies and we've hit the ground running. As we dig into our combined businesses, we see an opportunity to move even faster and potentially to unlock even more synergies from this combination than originally planned, opportunities like the acceleration of our retail rationalization and network integration. And we'll likely see additional upside from our increased scale in areas like procurement and potentially faster improvements in the churn rate of Sprint subscribers than planned. There's been a lot of talk about the changing landscape that we all find ourselves in right now. And I can say this about it. The value proposition and unprecedented network that we'll deliver will position New T-Mobile incredibly well to serve even more customers, particularly as the economic environment continues to change. I've said it before, and I'll say it again today, customers are not going to have to choose between a better value or a better network. With the New T-Mobile customers will finally get both. Before we dive into the results, I do want to highlight, how our company has navigated the impacts of COVID-19 so far. The way our people and this team has responded to support customers has been nothing short of heroic. And I couldn't be prouder of each and every one of them. The crisis has highlighted how crucial connectivity has become to our daily lives. And as it's unfolded in front of us, we took immediate steps to ensure our customers would continue to stay connected, while working hard to simultaneously protect the health and safety of our employees. We were one of the first to take bold steps to do our part to help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 with wide-scale temporary store closures and transitioning employees to work remotely, including 14,000 U.S.-based care employees from T-Mobile and Sprint. We utilized our digital capabilities to enable things like virtual retail, and we introduced curbside and mobile fulfillment. Through all this transition, our frontline employees have stepped up big to support our customers and continue to deliver the industry-leading customer service that makes us different. And that has translated into record-high NPS satisfaction scores. Right out of the gate, we knew that our network would see increases in demand and changes in usage patterns. So we took immediate action to increase capacity, including temporarily doubling our 600 megahertz capacity and expanding roaming for Sprint customers. Our network has performed phenomenally, delivering excellent reliability for our customers. In fact, according to OpenSignal average LTE download speeds on our 600 megahertz spectrum actually increased significantly even during this crisis, after we layered on the additional 600-megahertz capacity. We're also a proud supporter of the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge, and I really appreciate the work the Chairman, Pai and the FCC have done to bring the entire communications industry together during this crisis. As a result of our commitment, we've waived late fees and maintained service for our consumer and small business customers impacted by COVID-19, regardless of their ability to pay. Additionally, in the early phases of the crisis, we chose to lift smartphone high-speed data caps made additional smartphone mobile hotspot data available and accelerated the launch of T-Mobile Connect to support our customers, as they navigate the impacts of COVID-19. We've also donated millions of dollars through a number of initiatives to support our communities from support for Feeding America to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, local schools and programs for our frontline health care workers. I'm really proud of what this team is doing to help across the country. While this pandemic is definitely not over, we'll continue to take the necessary steps to support our customers and do what's right for our employees and communities as things start to reopen. This will result in some continued near-term impacts to our business. Stores that have been closed temporarily obviously reduced our store traffic and subsequent retail volumes. And that impacts customer additions, service revenues and equipment revenues in the very short-term. We also introduced some operational changes to help with business continuity, which has impacted our overall performance in the latter part of the first quarter and will likely continue in the second quarter. As the nation starts to emerge post COVID-19, customers across the industry will likely be looking for better value in a tougher economic environment and we'll continue to be there for our customers when they need us most. It's who we are and it's what our Un-carrier brand stands for. I expect that AT&T and Verizon customers will most certainly be looking to get out from under their high monthly bills in search of a better value. And it's likely there will also be an increase in churn from today's low levels as the carriers won't be able to keep themselves from squeezing customers who are already budget constrained. These factors will likely mean more switching across the industry as things change, and we will be there to help. We know from the past that T-Mobile does disproportionately well in an environment with larger pool of switchers. We're a proven share taker, and I intend to keep it that way. We will be there for our customers with prepaid and postpaid products that are geared to their needs, particularly in a time of constrained budgets. And we expect to consolidate our marketing and new offers under the T-Mobile brand later this summer, just as this switching opportunity starts to come to life. Okay. Time for a few T-Mobile stand-alone highlights from Q1. Let's start with our main business driver, branded postpaid phones, where we once again led the industry in growth with 452,000 net customer additions in Q1. Not that I'm counting, but that's 25 quarters in a row of leading the industry, this time with about 70% of the combined industry growth, which is approximately double the sum total of the rest of the industry combined including Big Cable. Total branded postpaid net additions were 777,000. And prepaid net losses were 128,000, yielding 649,000 total branded net adds for the quarter. One of the things I'm most proud of is our customer experience obsession at this company, which in part shows up in our branded postpaid phone churn numbers. We posted a record Q1 low of 0.86%, down 2 basis points versus last year and down 15 bps versus last quarter. I'm also really proud of our team's ability to deliver our financial results, while simultaneously taking care of our customers and employees during these difficult times. We've said it for years, investing in customers leads to customer growth, which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience, which is what started the success cycle in the first place. Our financial results in Q1 show that this winning formula continues to benefit consumers and shareholders alike. Service revenues in Q1 hit an all-time high of $8.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, more than twice the growth rate of the next best big provider. Adjusted EBITDA also hit an all-time record high of $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite the environment created by COVID-19. Free cash flow, excluding payments for merger-related costs, was $893 million, up 37% year-over-year. Now let's talk about the foundation of our New T-Mobile growth story, our network. Despite COVID-19, Neville and his team are hard at work expanding the network footprint and quality and continue making incredible progress. Our network continues to perform. And that's being amplified as we integrate Sprint's spectrum, putting us on our path to build the world's best 5G network. The whole process will take about three years to complete, but our team was able to take advantage of the extended approval cycle to get moving on a lot of the site leasing and permitting work ahead of time. Combining the spectrum holdings of T-Mobile and Sprint, the New T-Mobile controls 319 megahertz of combined low-band and mid-band spectrum nationwide, 319 megahertz. New T-Mobile's combined low and mid-band spectrum is nearly double that of AT&T and nearly triple that of Verizon. It's no wonder they spent the last two years fighting the merger behind the scenes. And while AT&T and Verizon are depending on millimeter wave spectrum for their 5G strategy. Well, we have that too with over 1,000 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum more than AT&T. We're ready to leapfrog the carriers and network capability. And you know what? They know it. In fact, we've already started deploying our 2.5-gigahertz spectrum on the T-Mobile network and Philadelphia is already live with peak speeds of over 600 megabits per second in our tests. And just yesterday we went live in New York City as well. And there will be many more other cities we'll light up in 2020 and beyond. For Sprint customers, we're delivering an enhanced network experience by significantly expanding access to the T-Mobile network to improve coverage as well as 5G availability. More than 80% of the Sprint postpaid phone base has compatible handsets today, and we are seeing a big increase in weekly roaming on the T-Mobile network as a result. Finally, we remain hard at work on all the network projects, you heard us talk about over the past year. Recall that, we launched America's first nationwide 5G network on 600-megahertz spectrum in early December, covering more than 200 million people right out of the gate. We have 215 million people covered with 5G today, recently lighting up 5G in Detroit, St. Louis, Columbus, Ohio, and just this week we turned up the Bay Area of California as well. So before I hand it over to Braxton, let me just say this. In the face of unprecedented adversity, we delivered another record setting quarter while simultaneously driving changes across our business to deliver for our customers and close one of the largest telecom mergers in history. We rose to the occasion and hit the ground running in our first five weeks as the New T-Mobile. We feel more confident than ever about our ability to unlock the massive synergy potential of this transaction and we already see opportunities for upside to our plans. Our passionate, fired-up workforce is focused on one singular mission being the absolute best at serving customers. The success of this business depends on it, and we're moving rapidly to drive innovation in this industry and supercharge competition. As we start to emerge from COVID-19 and look ahead, T-Mobile is a brand that's the best positioned to stand up for customers and deliver a great value combined with an amazing network right when they need it most. And with that, it's now time to ask our CFO, Braxton Carter to take us through the financials and guidance. Braxton take it away.\nBraxton Carter: Hey, thanks Mike. And yes, so I am proudly wearing my magenta hat out here in Washington wine country. The opportunity that lies ahead for New T-Mobile is significant. And as we look to unlock the massive synergy potential, I couldn't be more excited for what the team will deliver in the future. Let me get into some of the financial details of the quarter to best explain why. Record Q1 net income amounted to $951 million in Q1, up 5% year-over-year. And diluted earnings per share was $1.10, up 4%. Note that net income was fully burdened by the Sprint merger-related costs of $117 million as well as COVID-19-related costs of $86 million in the first quarter. Similarly, EPS was impacted by $0.14 related to the Sprint merger and $0.10 related to COVID-19. These costs $250 million combined before taxes are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to a record $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher service revenues and lower equipment sales, partially offset by higher cost of services and SG&A expenses. Cost of services as a percentage of service revenues increased by 10 basis points year-over-year in Q1, as we continued the rapid rollout of the 600-megahertz spectrum and investments to transform our 4G LTE network to 5G. SG&A as a percentage of service revenues increased by 70 basis points year-over-year in Q1 as we invested in our people and customers during this difficult time. Excluding the Sprint merger-related costs of $143 million and $117 million of supplemental employee payroll third-party commission and cleaning-related COVID-19 costs, SG&A would have been down 90 basis points year-over-year. Free cash flow increased by 18% year-over-year to $732 million in Q1, as net cash provided by operating activities increased 16% and cash CapEx decreased 9%. Free cash flow in Q1 included $161 million in payments for merger-related costs. Excluding these merger-related payments free cash flow would have been $893 million. Branded postpaid phone ARPU amounted to $45.80 in Q1, which was generally stable sequentially and year-over-year as an increase in our promotional activities including the ongoing growth in our Netflix offering, a reduction in regulatory program revenues from the continued adoption of tax inclusive plans and a reduction in certain nonrecurring charges were offset by the growing success of new customer segments and rate plans. We also reintroduced branded postpaid ARPA or average revenue per account this quarter, as we focus on growing total revenue per account, which is the real customer relationship. Branded postpaid ARPA was $129.47 in Q1 and was essentially flat year-over-year. In terms of customer quality, our results in the first quarter were impacted by the macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19. Total bad debt expense and losses from sale of receivables was $138 million or 1.24% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $108 million or 0.98% of total revenues in the first quarter of 2019. However, excluding the adoption of the new credit loss standard, which now recognizes lifetime expected credit losses upfront, bad debt would have been flat year-over-year in Q1. We are watching bad debt very closely given the current economic backdrop, which may put pressure on bad debt in the next few quarters, but we feel we are well prepared to manage through these economic conditions. One reason we feel well prepared is that subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we raised $23 billion in debt financing. I am super proud of what we achieved. When you think about it, we literally hit the market the day we closed the merger when the markets have basically been closed for weeks and we're able to issue $19 billion in investment-grade notes. Even in that market, the confidence and excitement to invest in T-Mobile led to an order book of $74 billion. And despite it being our first issuance in the investment-grade market, our 10-year notes have recently been trading inside where AT&T notes are trading. In addition, our recent merger loan syndication with another strong showing from investors effectively reopened the leverage loan market, which had been quiet since the inception of the COVID crisis. Just a remarkable execution by our team and that support from the market gives us confidence in our liquidity and our ability to go full speed ahead on the integration of Sprint and T-Mobile businesses. So let's get to guidance. Due to uncertainty around the ongoing impact of COVID-19, purchase price accounting, accounting policy alignment work we are providing guidance for the New T-Mobile for Q2 2020 at this time. We expect to provide full year 2020 guidance on our Q2 earnings call when we share the combined quarterly results of New T-Mobile and hopefully have better visibility into the COVID-19 and economic conditions for the back half of the year. For Q2, we expect postpaid net customer additions between zero and 150,000. This reflects the ongoing impact of COVID-19, including retail store closures and lower gross adds, partially offset by lower churn. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion in Q2. Our adjusted EBITDA target includes leasing revenues of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Cash purchases of the property and equipment including capitalized interest of approximately $100 million are expected to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for Q2 2020 and will ramp substantially as we get into the outer parts of the year. In Q2 2020 merger-related costs are expected to be $500 million to $600 million before taxes. These costs are excluded from adjusted EBITDA but will impact net income and cash flows. These amounts are before any incremental opportunities to accelerate synergy realization through a potential pull forward of additional spending into Q2, such as severance-related restructuring, store rationalization and network build expenses. COVID-19-related costs not included in adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $450 million to $550 million before taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities includes payments for merger-related and COVID-19-related costs and including $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps is expected to be in the range of $0.7 billion to $1 billion. Free cash flow including payments for merger-related and COVID-19-related costs but excluding $2.3 billion in gross payments for the settlement of interest rate swaps is expected to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We will continue to monitor developments regarding COVID-19 and evaluate appropriate steps we need to take as a business to align with guidelines from state, local and federal government agencies to do what is best for our employees and customers. We expect our business liquidity and financial condition as well as operating results to continue to be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the remainder of 2020 and potentially thereafter. The full impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to predict and is subject to uncertainty. Potential impacts may include lower net customer additions, equipment revenues and cost of equipment sales; and higher bad debt expense; continued cost to protect and support our employees and customers, which will increase from the costs incurred during the first quarter of 2020; and potential disruptions to our supply chains. In addition, we are in the process of reevaluating our spending across various operating areas. We are taking actions to adjust our spending given the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of any recessional impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainties related to COVID-19 may also adversely impact the Q2 guidance we provided. Now let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Hey, thanks very much. Good evening. Thanks for all the color. Mike, perhaps you could just give us a sense of what the integration, where you are so far, you've had a few weeks now to work with the Sprint team, obviously in difficult circumstances but any color around what the positives have been so far? And what are the areas where maybe you need to -- you're finding things taking longer whatever. And then for Neville, good to see the 5G lighting up. Can you give us a little bit more color on what to expect from the fixed wireless initiatives during 2020 and beyond? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Well, sure. Yes Simon, I have to say that one of the things we're most excited about is as I said in my remarks upfront is that after five weeks as one team, if anything we see more potential to go faster and to go bigger on synergy attainment and growth than we had been expecting. And there's a number of reasons for that. Among them the fact that we see opportunities to move faster on certain things like network. We had a long time to prepare for this merger. And we lift a lot of track when it comes to permitting and leasing and we're moving fast. And as we start to knock this down, it does appear that there's going to be a pace to this that may be able to stay ahead of schedule relative to our now two-year-old plans that calculated up all these synergies. Retail rationalization might go faster than expected. We had always expected to get after marketing one brand pretty quickly but getting the retail fleets rationalized due to systems issues and people issues, et cetera was something we always thought would take a little bit more time. We may be able to move faster and that could accelerate synergies. Procurement looks like an area of possibility to exceed plan. On the customer side, the churn level of Sprint customers is one of the most financially sensitive things. And we certainly have hopes that we can see faster movement there as we tackle this network integration at a faster pace. Already we've lit up more roaming for Sprint customers than we had expected to be able to do and we're starting to see how they respond to that. And you know what? They like it, which is great. So we're not in a position to guide on it or to give you anything concrete yet. I can just tell you that, five weeks in we're really optimistic. And you saw from our print today that, standalone business is very strong. You saw our Sprint subscriber numbers a couple of days ago. Those were better than most people expected. So we also walked into this with some momentum. Now as Braxton pointed out, COVID took a bite out of that for everybody. And there are temporary impacts on our business. But you know what? They're just that temporary. And our view is that if anything there's opportunity in the environment that we're going to see when social distancing lifts. As I said in my remarks, people are going to be looking for value. They're really going to be hungry to make sure they've got the right value. They're not going to drop this category. I mean, no way. This category is so important, but they might be asking if they've got the right carrier. And if switching comes and is elevated versus these low levels, we will be prepared to stand up and give customers what they're looking for. So we're feeling very optimistic. Even though it's the premise of your question, look, there's some aspects to it that have knocked everybody in this industry off their stride. Comparatively speaking, we feel very good. And over the mid and long-term, we perhaps feel even better than our deal model that we contemplated two years ago. Your second question, I think was for Neville and I might follow-up too about the network conditions and as it relates to broadband, right?\nSimon Flannery: Sure.\nNeville Ray: Yes. I'll pick it up. So, great to see Simon, and as you referenced I mean the 2.5-gigahertz rollout is absolutely key, right? I mean, that's the material spectrum advantage we now have in this mid-band 5G space. Mike outlined north of 300 megahertz of sub-6 gig spectrum for T-Mobile and nobody and the team is more eager than me and my team to get this stuff rolled out. So we didn't sit on our hands during the pendency of the deal. We've got stuff into leasing and zoning activity. And we were building 2.5 in Philly parts of New York before the deal closed actually. And so we were able to turn some of that stuff up immediately on close and that we just referenced New York and 2.5 rollout coming online this week. And to your question on broadband and fixed, I mean that 2.5-gigahertz spectrum is the critical piece. As we start to ramp that rollout that's going to build capacity specifically great 5G capacity for us to start serving our customers not just with the traditional mobility and wireless service that we're killing it with, but also one in this broadband space. And it takes some time. Obviously, we're not rolling out -- I wish we could roll out 2.5 overnight. It's going to take us months and into years to get that program fully complete across the nation. But as we do that and as capacity becomes available then we'll start to look at delivering that broadband capability to our customers as we've outlined in our deal advocacy and our business plans. It's a very material part of how we see shaping the competitive landscape as we move forward. Probably not too much this year, but I'm hopeful that we'll be making some inroads next year and beyond.\nMike Sievert: Simon the cable companies are good companies. They're good people, but it's the least competitive market in the history of man. I mean, everybody knows that. And so to us as you know you know how we're wired. I mean, we're competitors. And as Neville says, we're itching to get in there, because we've got a value proposition that I think is going to resonate with millions of people to be able to bring 5G-based home Internet access to people that have never had a choice, never one single choice for many of them. And man, that's going to be fun. So we've got to get the network in condition. As Neville said, it's more next year and beyond than this year, but we're rearing to go, and we see a very big opportunity to change that landscape in that market forever. Great. Thanks a lot.\nMike Sievert: Okay.\nJud Henry: Hope another one is coming from the phone operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : Thanks. I actually want to follow-up\nMike Sievert: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Hey, guys. I want to follow-up something Mike you were just talking about the ability to bring Sprint churn down maybe faster than you initially hoped. You alluded to one tactic, which was more rapidly making roaming onto the T-Mobile network, which has superior coverage available to them. But what else do you have to do? Is there a lot of outlets you need? Are there certain vulnerable customers who maybe aren't on the right rate plans and legacy Sprint churn on the phone side was twice legacy T-Mobile churn. I mean, what's the bogey here? Can you get it down to T-Mobile levels? What's realistic? And then just a quick one for Braxton. I don't know if you have it or not, but do you know what the pro forma cash position of the company was at closing net of all the closing fees and so forth? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Well, I'll take the first one. And yes, Brett. As you know the number one driver of churn for any carrier and particularly for Sprint is network. And that's what drives people away more than anything. Network. And then the second one is value. And then you bump those two key drivers of churn up against the value proposition that we're building, we're building the best network at the best value. No one's ever been able to offer that before, the lowest prices and the best network. And those are why people churn bar none. That's it. Those are the top two out of two. So I can't predict for you how fast that will dawn on Sprint customers, as we start to give them at their incredible rate plans, the best network in the country. But they're going to turn out, because of this merger to be some of the smartest shoppers this industry has, because we're not going to force them to change their rate plans. We're going to honor those rate plans. And yet we're going to serve them up the best network that this industry's ever seen. And so we're starting to see some benefits of that already and people like it. So that's great. But we've got a lot of work to do. To your point about rate plans, we don't think we have all that much tuning up to do. It turns out that the differences between Sprint ARPU and T-Mobile ARPU, don't have much to do with the fact that Sprint's prices are higher. It has to do with artifacts like, T-Mobile has more lines per account, and therefore more added lines on average than Sprint does, and a different penetration of business, and different numbers of unlimited customers, other artifacts, but not really a dynamic that would suggest that Sprint's prices are higher. So I can't wait to get at it. As we talked about, we're going to start to unify this summer under one T-Mobile flagship brand with an integrated retail fleet and integrated brand that we're going to do everything we can to get that network experience tuned up for Sprint customers faster than they expect. And I think we're going to like what we see from all that.\nBraxton Carter: Hey Brett on the pro forma opening cash or the actual cash for New T-Mobile we had $7.5 billion after paying all merger-related expenses on 4/1 we have a $4 billion undrawn revolver fully in place five year. So, a total of $11.5 billion of liquidity. Amazingly two years -- two and a half years ago, when we modeled the opening balance sheet, we modeled $11 billion of liquidity including a $4 billion revolver. So, we're actually $0.5 billion ahead. And I want to point out it's a great question. With the financing in place and the opening liquidity we have a fully funded business plan to do everything that we need to do to get to run rate synergies. And you heard Mike talk about our enthusiasm about acceleration of synergies which also means some acceleration of cost to achieve but getting those unlocks quicker. And especially in COVID-19 we are laser-focused on acceleration of these synergies to offset some of the impacts that we're seeing just given this unprecedented crisis for the world.\nMike Sievert: Thank you. So, let's go over to Twitter since this is a Twitter conference. And again you can send us questions #TMUS or @MikeSievert. Neville let's bring you into the conversation. Walt Piecyk has a question. Actually there's two questions you might address simultaneously. Walt says what percent of macro have 2.5 gigahertz in the city Neville. I assume he's talking about New York. And then Ronald @ronald_809, I love this one because again we launched last night. Okay. We launched last night in New York City the first example of our full-layer cake. Hey Neville when will the new T-Mobile layer cake expand to fully cover NYC like the Bronx and Queens and Staten Island didn't you leave out parts of Brooklyn? So, how about it Neville?\nNeville Ray: I wish I could say it would all happen this week. But yes to both questions I mean we're just getting started but we're delighted to make this start. I mean we are literally as Mike said earlier on; we're five weeks into this combination with Sprint. And we're already deploying. So, I think coming out -- we were determined to come out of the blocks super quick. I don't think many folks anticipated we would be deploying the 2.5-gig spectrum so quickly but we have made a start and we're starting in big cities. Here's a fun stat for you all. If you look at the square miles of just what we launched in Philly and we built and put that on air inside really the 30 days of March through the deal. But if you look at the square miles of that footprint in metro Philly, it's approximately two, two and a half times the entire footprint of Verizon's millimeter wave 5G on a nationwide basis. So, they've been rolling this 5G thing out they say for I don't know two years. But in a month I mean we more than doubled the footprint. And yes, I mean mid-band 5G versus millimeter wave we're just going to kill it from a coverage perspective. So, we're moving. We're moving quickly. I mean we're in the key markets in the Northeast that's a big focus for us. I'll give a shout out obviously to my team to the Ericsson guys who've done a great job making this happen. And more importantly, as we look forward, we will launch and build out and lay 2.5-gigahertz spectrum across thousands of sites in 2020. We're off to a great start benefiting from that work from last year which we did at risk. And the rollout of 2.5 is going to move super super-quick. So, we've managed through COVID to deal with permitting delays et cetera. Obviously our teams are working with safety and their health as a paramount and primary concern. But the federal air cover we have as a critical service provider has been key. We actually built over 1,000 sites this last month of April rolling out new spectrum onto those sites. And our plan is to ramp very heavily as we move into this month of May and on through the year. So, lots of 2.5 gig coming. New York, Philly all of the northeast markets very much in our sights as are most of the major metros across the U.S. So, a lot more moves to come and we'll keep everybody posted. New York just turned up as Mike said and Ronald asked. And there were folks running around in New York looking and testing of that I assume observing social distancing and shelter-at-home protocols but I saw some stuff on social with 600 even 700 megabit per second speeds. And so this is with a very limited volume of 2.5-gigahertz spectrum rolled out at this point in time 40 to 60 megahertz. And remember we have secured with the combination with Sprint about 150. So, we have a long way to go in terms of the performance capability, but what we have on the ground is just incredibly exciting. So, key to our deal and key to that consumer experience that we're going to roll out aggressively as we move through the balance of this year.\nMike Sievert: And Neville while you're on a roll I ask this at some risk and peril because I know you're enthusiastic. But I responded to Brett's question a little bit by discussing the roaming situation and we're getting questions now on the site. Could you tell us more about what's the roaming experience like for Sprint customers how much of it is happening? And roaming itself is kind of a funny turn because they're all our customers. But we're essentially using roaming technology while we operate two networks. Can you just very briefly touch on the day-to-day experience that Sprint customers are experiencing now that we've turned that up so extensively?\nNeville Ray: Yes absolutely. And again Mike in terms of momentum and integration work I mean kudos to John Sore [ph] and Prasad [ph] and the team I mean we turned up nationwide LTE roaming across all of our sites effectively on 4/1 data clubs. So, all the work ahead of time to make sure that could happen. And what does that mean? It means that the Sprint postpaid customer base when they -- wherever they fall off the Sprint network be that in a rural geography or in building location in Manhattan or wherever it may be, they can now see the T-Mobile network. We know that that network churn was a key driver of the overall churn within Sprint and we're seeing big uptake. I mean on a weekly basis, we're seeing approximately around 10 million unique roamers. I don't like the term roaming, but Sprint customers now leveraging the T-Mobile network. So that's more than one-third of the postpaid phone subscriber base that we have with Sprint. So a lot of uptake. And then just within the last week or so we've activated and provided access for nationwide 5G on our low band. And that footprint is growing every day 250 million pops. We just launched the Bay Area. I mean so that footprint which is the foundational layer to the layer cake of our 5G strategy that's growing like a weed. I mean the teams have been knocking it out of the park building out 600 and our Sprint customers with a 5G-capable phone and now getting access to that footprint too. So lots of dimensions very, very focused on making sure that all of our Sprint customers are getting the best they can from that combination of the Sprint and T-Mobile network.\nMike Sievert: Well, thanks everyone. That's all the time we have. Thanks for joining us today. Operator let's take the next question from the phone queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Rollins: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious, if you could just provide some additional color as you're approaching the midpoint of the quarter just in terms of this environment. A little more of what's happening to sales activity and maybe the customer payment behavior. Some companies have disclosed the number of pledges their customers have taken. And you mentioned earlier a cost for COVID-19 that will be excluded from EBITDA. I think it was about $450 million to $550 million for 2Q. Could you just expand on what would get incorporated into those expenses? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Braxton, let's start with you on the -- what's included and how to think about the cost. And then maybe Matt and I can tag team on what we're seeing in the marketplace.\nBraxton Carter: Yes, absolutely. So Mike with really busting down the COVID guidance you have about $350 million-ish of supplemental pay and paid time not worked. And we were paying hazard pay for some of the critical infrastructure that we had to put up. It's an amazing accomplishment of what happened in customer service. At the start of this crisis, everyone reported to a call center. Callie has now well over 90% of our customer service reps fully connected in the home and not working. But during that time period, we absolutely were paying hazard pay as well as supplemental pay to support and keep our team intact. That also happened in the retailer and dealer community. So that $350 million is really dissipating at this point. As Mike said, we're significantly opening up distribution as the country steps out of this. And that won't be a significant reoccurring item. The second item is facilities and cleaning and PPE. And that's roughly a $50 million ticket. Very extensive protocols in place, extremely important to protect our people and to protect our customers, and a very understandable and worthwhile expenditure. The final item on here is a range on bad debt, specifically, related to the FCC pledge. All other bad debts, of course, aren't included in here nor regular pay for people who are working. And that bad debt range is going to be somewhere in the $75 million to $125 million. What's happening is the inability to disconnect you're building up multiple layers of payments that need to be due. And at this point, this is our best estimate that we've seen that we were able to come up with about the ultimate cost of this pledge, which has now been extended through June 30 on our business. We are certainly taking mitigation items. We got a significant number of customers that are paying. But we do have customers who aren't paying and thus we anticipate that additional bad debt. So that's really the breakdown for you on that. Any other questions before we go to the other part of your question?\nMichael Rollins: That's very helpful. Thanks.\nBraxton Carter: You\u2019re welcome, Michael.\nMike Sievert: Yes. The second piece, we're a share taker. And a share taker likes a competitive environment with a certain amount of churn. Everybody's been home and churn itself has fallen quite a bit. And so obviously, we like an environment where people are able and have less friction to being able to switch providers. And notwithstanding that we've been competing very hard and finding really innovative ways to get that done. So we were killing it in January and February. And then, of course, things came to a pretty fast stop in March. We were quicker to execute slowdowns and shutdowns of our retail in March. We felt it was very important to be decisive. We're based here in Seattle where the whole thing started and we took it probably more seriously than others did. So we moved faster. And we may have been more effective in March than some. All that has equalized now. But Matt, why don't you give us a little color on what you're seeing? And then very briefly I may ask Jon to talk a little bit about virtual retail and curbside and some of the things happening to mitigate market environment from Matt Staneff.\nMatt Staneff: Yes. Thanks, Mike for the question. As Mike Sievert just said, we saw a pretty rapid slowdown in our business because we took these proactive measures around retail stores for the health and safety of our employees and customers in general. And the market had a pronounced decline right off the gate. And what you're seeing what we're seeing in the marketplace right now is generally consistent with what you're hearing in the news and in other places is that things are starting to rebound and things are starting to turn a corner. It was closed down and slowed for quite a while in the first part of the month. We're seeing generally speaking some of the categories that you naturally would expect to react in a marketplace like this so it's to rebound faster interpret that as the prepaid market is starting to rebound a little bit more. There's stimulus money in the marketplace. Consumers are coming out and starting to shop again and switch. And as Mike said, we really enjoy a marketplace where there's a lot of industry switching and that's important for us to continue to grow our net adds as we move forward. So we're starting to see some signs that the marketplace is rebounding in the areas I've talked about, but we've got a long way to go to get back to normal levels of industry switching and consumer buying behavior as we see this thing out throughout the quarter. We've also seen some particular strength in some of the other areas public sector is an example. Lots of students need connectivity on learning and things of that nature. So we've been pretty active in participating in those parts of the markets as well.\nMike Sievert: We're not waiting for the market to just return to normal. We're changing how we operate. Jon Freier just very briefly about the rapid work we've done to change what retail means in this company.\nJon Freier: Yes, Mike. Thank you. And yes on March 16th as most of you know we took this big bold decision, one of the quickest decisions in our space to close the majority of our retail stores about 80% of our company-owned stores. And rather than just kind of sit there on the sideline and just let nature take its course, we went into action to take a number of our retail employees and convert them to virtual retail mobile experts, meaning that when you go to tmobile.com, you can chat from a -- click a button chat with an expert and be able to learn more about T-Mobile, be able to add lines to your account. We had a lot of people that, of course, in a remote learning environment and a virtual learning environment a number of people had to take action to support those learning environments for children on that home. So we wanted to continue to be there while our stores were closed. We saw a 500% increase in the number of people that we typically have in virtual retail by converting our mobile experts that typically work in stores to that virtual retail environment and continue to serve customers in that way. And then also from a curbside delivery perspective we didn't have that capability prior to COVID-19 and working with Toni Stanford [ph] and his product and technology team, we were able to kind of stand up this curbside delivery capability within all of our company-owned stores that we have up and running today. And that is, okay, I can continue to talk to T-Mobile through the app through chat and be able to walk through a transaction and be able to pick that up at a store in a contactless kind of a way. So I couldn't be more proud of these capabilities that got turned in a rapid fashion to continue to serve customers. And I got to tell you our team in all of our stores, Callie Field's team and all of customer care, we've said this once and probably million times, but let me just say million and one times. We just had the best frontline teams in the entire country maybe even on the face of the planet. I just couldn't be more proud of the heroism of our teams to move fast continue to be there to serve customers and keep the business continuity of this company going.\nJud Henry: Well, terrific. Well, operator, let\u2019s go back to the phone for next question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS.\nMike Sievert : Hey, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Hey, how are you doing Mike? Thanks for the question. I guess, first on that postpaid net add guidance for 2Q for New T-Mobile zero to 150,000. Typically postpaid phones are a subset of that number. So I know you don't typically guide to phones, but should we understand that how the stores are closed that you guys might actually lose postpaid phones in the second quarter? And then maybe if there's sort of some background in terms of what are your assumptions within that number in terms of bringing those stores back online? And then question for Neville. Could you talk about the deployment of the 600-megahertz spectrum you guys are to grant from DISH? I'd imagine that you'd deploy that with your LTE network. What kind of performance, are you getting from that extra spectrum? And any thoughts on outlook in terms of your ability to secure that on a longer term basis? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. I'm going to try to hit those pretty fast. So first of all on the first piece, no, we expect postpaid phones to be positive, not negative. And we're seeing nice trends develop. So we gave the guidance that we gave. I'm very hopeful that we'll see strength through the rest of the quarter. And it does assume that we continue to see some increasing momentum slowly happening through the quarter as social distancing ebbs a bit. But it doesn't assume a wholesale change in customer behavior. We would assume that June would have more going on than May and May more than April, but not step changes. And Neville, do you want to hit the second one very quickly?\nBraxton Carter: Let me just add really quick too. John, you know our playbook. And our playbook has not changed. We're conservative in the way we position to The Street. We got an impeccable track record of doing what we said we were going to do and nothing has changed about that. Neville?\nNeville Ray: Yes. So thanks John. We doubled our speeds. I mean, I think the additional 600 was great the kind of country and our customers needed it during COVID-19. We've, obviously, extended our pledge commitment. We are working with many of those 600 providers to see if they will extend. I'm hopeful they will and continue to enable us to better serve our customers during this period. So more capacity and more speed is exactly what was needed and allowed us to deal with a lot of peaks and increases in traffic that we saw on the network during a very difficult time. So big shout out and thank you to the FCC and Chairman Pai and also the holders that loaned us their spectrum. And as I said, we're hopeful they'll extend a little longer with us as the pledge continues.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you.\nJud Henry: All right. Let\u2019s go back to the phone, operator.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Phil.\nPhilip Cusick: Congratulations again on getting the deal done and Mike on your promotion. Great. First Braxton assuming your EBITDA was stable from 1Q to 2Q at T-Mobile, the guide would imply Sprint EBITDA ex-leasing of about $1.4 billion to $1.55 billion. So about $6 billion run rate, which is about what we expected maybe a little lower. Do you expect to restate EBITDA that Sprint's doing from this methodology? Or is this guide a good way to look at the run rate going forward?\nBraxton Carter: Yes. It's a great question Phil. We are in the process of aligning over 200 accounting policies that are disparate. And you can be informed on the significant items in the pro formas that we put out. So, we know the material ins and outs and those are certainly embedded in here. But there's a lot of miscellaneous stuff that we're working through. We also have the very significant exercise of the purchase price allocation. And what assets, how do we value the assets are going to create differences that are not known at this point throughout the geography of the income statement. We don't anticipate any material deviations from the purchase price accounting on the EBITDA numbers that are already baked into this guidance. But what we haven't worked through is all the valuation of the assets including capitalized lease devices things like the wireline business, so on and so forth. And that can create some issues when it comes to what the valuation and what the depreciation run rate is. But we're not providing net add or EPS, but there will be changes that come out of this. We also have a significant KPI alignment to the T-Mobile policies. And in our disclosures, as you pour through everything, you will see that we have specifically mentioned that there will be significant adjustments to the Sprint subscriber base. And until we finish that work, we're not in a position to quantify it. It will be significant. It will be reductions in multiple categories. And of course that will have impacts on various KPIs as we're looking at the business. Hopefully that's helpful.\nPhilip Cusick: That is helpful. But as I -- just to go back to the guidance, since you're putting out guidance on total EBITDA and then ex leasing is it fair to say that any of the changes that you mentioned wouldn't be enough to push it outside of this range that you've given?\nBraxton Carter: We got an impeccable track record here and we're conservative in the way that we guide. And -- but we fully believe that its material representation or we wouldn't have given it.\nPhilip Cusick: Great. And then just last thing quickly, I didn't hear you quantify the number of subscribers in the FCC pledge category. Can you give that to us?\nMike Sievert: Yes. We did -- yes, I was just going to jump in. We didn't quantify it but that's because we work with every customer. A big piece of how we operate is -- and this may be different for us than some of our competitors because part of our core competency is working with people on very tight budgets and who occasionally have difficult circumstances. And a part of our normal is having to deal with every customer and find a way to meet their needs and we've carried on doing that. Callie Field and team have carried on doing that while having to move 15,000 people to work from home, 92% of our workforce. And so we're honoring the pledge and it's costly. I'm not trying to say it's not incremental. It is costly. But it's hard to count every individual customer because a big part of this is you treat those customers. And we're not going to disconnect them but we are going to encourage them not to stack up bills that they can't afford and to make sure they're on a product and service that they can afford. And our team of customer care heroes are just fantastic at that. And they've stepped up and found new ways of working under Callie's leadership. I'm so proud of them. But it's very difficult for us to quantify in those kinds of numbers. What we have done is make sure you understand the total potential financial tally. Let's go to Twitter and then two more from the phone. And just fair warning for everybody, I will have to step away for the last few minutes of the call. Braxton will be emceeing for us. But I don't want to ignore Twitter. And for example Bill Ho is asking about enterprise, looking ahead to integrating and ramping up T-Mobile Business Group. Mike Katz, Mike Sievert what's the thinking on Enterprise segment growth and competition? Is it low-hanging fruit? By the way we keep talking about day one being mid-summer. We're talking about consumer for that part. Mike Katz and his enterprise team have already achieved day 1 integrating an entire combined Sprint and T-Mobile selling force behind one value proposition under the T-Mobile brand. That was achieved just this week. We're getting off to the races. I'm really proud of what the team's doing and how fast they're forming to capture this opportunity. And Mike I don't know if you want to very briefly give a little bit of color on what you're seeing.\nMike Katz: Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes I think one thing that's important is at stand-alone T-Mobile we already had a lot of momentum coming into the integration. We had record quarters in enterprise and large government for the last couple of years every single quarter, so a lot of momentum. So now this larger now integrated team has a lot to work with. And this trade-off that Mike talked about at the beginning of the call customers historically having to trade between great network and great price and service experience that is as important to enterprise customers as it is to consumers. And what we're seeing so far is we interact with enterprises. And they're really, really responding to that. And I think the timing for it couldn't be better as we're in the middle of COVID and big macroeconomic impacts as a result of COVID. We're seeing many enterprises going through big cost transformation exercises including what they spend and how they structure their spend in this category. And we think that positions us for a lot of opportunity considering that AT&T and Verizon control 90% of the revenue in the enterprise space. So, we think it's a big, big growth opportunity for us and we're really well positioned post-merger.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks for taking the questions. Braxton, is this the last earnings call, we get you on?\nBraxton Carter: Mike, are you still on? That's a question...\nJonathan Chaplin: That's why I asked.\nBraxton Carter: Okay. Let me tell you -- let me put it this way that I was supposed to retire two years ago. I've extended three times. We have nothing to announce today. Ultimately whatever capacity, I love this company. I'm not going anywhere. And in some form, I will definitely be part of the future. Just stay tuned for future announcements.\nJonathan Chaplin: Rooting for a fourth extension. Just very quickly, on the -- if you guys are getting the retail integration done by sometime in the summer, does that mean there's about $1 billion in SG&A synergies that you should have captured by the end of the year?\nBraxton Carter: We're not prepared at this point to really do quantifications. If you really listen to what we were saying about guidance, we are right now operationalizing accelerations of what original plans were, specifically driven by COVID. And quite frankly, Jonathan, we just need some time to work through it and then we'll be able to provide color. And that color, we plan on providing in the second quarter earnings call, which will be the first New T-Mobile earnings call and we're just going to have to wait at this point. I don't want to give you an estimate that's not fully baked, but we're very focused on that, as we are on acceleration of other synergies and that's all good news. I want to reiterate, we are extremely confident that the opportunity is actually more than $43 billion. And some of our acceleration moves at this point is only part of that. I mean to the extent that we can accelerate during this time period, it's going to increase the NPV. But, quite frankly, we got pressures because of COVID, as you're saying. And we're super focused on addressing those pressures and making up for them and we've got a lot of material here to work with. Jon, do you want to add anything?\nJon Freier: Yes. Braxton, I will just reiterate exactly what you said. We're working this really hard. And I think Mike Sievert had an opportunity to say that, the last couple of calls that, one of the benefits of this transaction taking a little bit longer to finally getting approved and to cross the finish line is that, we've had a longer runway to plan. And that's exactly what we're seeing. We've had a number of discussions with independently owned and operated operators around store closures. We're working through that, have been working through that, have gotten through them very very quickly. Also we have a lot of integration, internal integration efforts that we're doing that we once thought would be impossible, because we're not physically together. We're having to do all of this work virtually, but I've just been incredibly pleased about the amount of interactions that we can do with the team virtually. We've got tens of thousands of employees across the country in retail between the two legacy companies that we're bringing together. And that's just gone incredibly well thus far, in terms of having people do the necessary training, getting people up to speed on installing our systems into the legacy Sprint stores, taking legacy Sprint systems installing them into legacy Magenta stores. So that we can say, yes, we can help you no matter if you're a T-Mobile customer or a Sprint-branded customer, regardless of the store that you visit. So we are in a really good place, call it six weeks, not even six weeks, five-and-a-half weeks into this integration after close. So we're very confident. We're moving fast. We're ahead of schedule in terms of the discussions that we've had. We're very bullish on realizing our distribution-related synergies this year. And we're looking forward to showing you some results here very soon.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys.\nBraxton Carter: Okay. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Thank you taking my question.\nBraxton Carter: Hey, Jennifer.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Hi, guys. Thanks taking the questions. I wanted to ask -- maybe this is more in Neville's category. We've all been programmed to believe wireless needs wires and with that is a strong fiber element. So I think you said you're going to connect thousands of 2.5 sites this year. That requires fiber and significant backhaul. How confident are you in partners? Or would you do what one of your competitors are doing and taking on an organic fiber build? And then, if I may, just your current thoughts on DSS capabilities, it didn't seem like you were that positive last time we spoke on one of these calls. Has that changed at all?\nNeville Ray: So I'll hit these quick, Jennifer. So our model has been a leased fiber model. We generally do not build fiber to our sites. We let others do that and we get great prices from them for the services we need. And we've been scaling our backhaul for a 5G world for some time. And the performance we're seeing out of these sites we're upgrading with just limited volumes of 2.5 spectrum today are all supported by multi-gig backhaul. And so, we're in a very strong place on that and our providers will continue to drive a lot of intense competition in that space with our model. So that looks to continue on. On DSS, yes, I think, my comments last call seem to -- was there a big discussion in the industry on DSS. And do I feel a lot better? Not really. I was very clear on that call that one vendor is trailing and they're still kind of trailing. So I think the sum of it is, DSS is going to happen. We've heard from our competition and similar to us something will happen this year. But the key message Jennifer is, we're not dependent on DSS for our 5G rollout. And our nationwide footprint is there already. And it's growing at a tremendous pace, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And that's the way to rollout 5G with fiber spectrum not having to share the spectrum with LTE users of between LTE users and 5G users. And our position our wealth of spectrum provides us a wealth of that cover in terms of not having to be reliant on DSS. Now that said, we will deploy the technology. But it's still bumpy.\nJennifer Fritzsche: Great, thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay operator. We will take one final question here.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. I don't know whether we've still got Mike or not. But Mike since you mentioned it, on CNBC a little while ago, I'm wondering if you could just walk through the walk so to speak of how you get to mid-40 -- sorry mid-50s margins over the long-term in the merged company. Sort of where are the sources of the difference between your margins and say Verizon's or AT&T's today? And then how you close that gap to get to the mid-50s?\nBraxton Cart: Yes. Unfortunately Craig, Mike had to leave. That guidance that Mike was talking about was really the same guidance that we rolled out and talked about during dependency of the merger. And there are multiple aspects there. The first aspect of course is scale. When we look at the leverage on the fixed cost in this highly capital-intensive business and analyze our cost structures versus whatever transparency we can get on AT&T and Verizon, which quite frankly has been reducing with some of their changes. We believe a huge part of that is scale driven. We believe that we're actually much more efficient in many parts of our cost structure. And that scale piece of it is super important. Of course, with the completion of this merger, we just had a significant increase in our scale. And this is a growth company. And even though, we're in this crazy pandemic time period, we will continue being a growth company. And our Q1 was on fire, until we hit the early part of March, in social distancing and everything that went in place just drove all the traffic to an essential stop. But as Mike said, this will be temporary. So we will continue to organically scale with the combined assets. And then the second part of the equation, it is really the efficiencies that we gained from the merger. By shutting down the duplicate network, having a significant reduction in the overall fixed costs associated with this business, is the second major component for massive margin expansion. And you've heard us have extreme confidence on this. And you've also heard on this call that we're doing everything we can to accelerate that. I mean, I'm just amazed that Neville has been able to make the progress that he's made with his team so quickly. And we'll be giving you a lot more color and readouts as time goes on, about how much focus and aggressiveness, we're chasing these synergies. And that's ultimately going to create a lot of goodness there.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you, Braxton.\nBraxton Cart: You're welcome.\nJud Henry: Okay. I want to really thank everybody for tuning in. I hope everybody's families are safe. Our thoughts are with you during these very, very difficult times. And we very much look forward to the first New T-Mobile earnings call for the second quarter, and sharing with you the first set of results and results of a lot of the things that we're working on here. And it's going to be very, very exciting, Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile U.S. First Quarter 2020, Earnings Call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Katz",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Mike. Yes I think one thing that's important is at stand-alone T-Mobile we already had a lot of momentum coming into the integration. We had record quarters in enterprise and large government for the last couple of years every single quarter, so a lot of momentum. So now this larger now integrated team has a lot to work with. And this trade-off that Mike talked about at the beginning of the call customers historically having to trade between great network and great price and service experience that is as important to enterprise customers as it is to consumers. And what we're seeing so far is we interact with enterprises. And they're really, really responding to that. And I think the timing for it couldn't be better as we're in the middle of COVID and big macroeconomic impacts as a result of COVID. We're seeing many enterprises going through big cost transformation exercises including what they spend and how they structure their spend in this category. And we think that positions us for a lot of opportunity considering that AT&T and Verizon control 90% of the revenue in the enterprise space. So, we think it's a big, big growth opportunity for us and we're really well positioned post-merger."

            "content": "Yes. Unfortunately Craig, Mike had to leave. That guidance that Mike was talking about was really the same guidance that we rolled out and talked about during dependency of the merger. And there are multiple aspects there. The first aspect of course is scale. When we look at the leverage on the fixed cost in this highly capital-intensive business and analyze our cost structures versus whatever transparency we can get on AT&T and Verizon, which quite frankly has been reducing with some of their changes. We believe a huge part of that is scale driven. We believe that we're actually much more efficient in many parts of our cost structure. And that scale piece of it is super important. Of course, with the completion of this merger, we just had a significant increase in our scale. And this is a growth company. And even though, we're in this crazy pandemic time period, we will continue being a growth company. And our Q1 was on fire, until we hit the early part of March, in social distancing and everything that went in place just drove all the traffic to an essential stop. But as Mike said, this will be temporary. So we will continue to organically scale with the combined assets. And then the second part of the equation, it is really the efficiencies that we gained from the merger. By shutting down the duplicate network, having a significant reduction in the overall fixed costs associated with this business, is the second major component for massive margin expansion. And you've heard us have extreme confidence on this. And you've also heard on this call that we're doing everything we can to accelerate that. I mean, I'm just amazed that Neville has been able to make the progress that he's made with his team so quickly. And we'll be giving you a lot more color and readouts as time goes on, about how much focus and aggressiveness, we're chasing these synergies. And that's ultimately going to create a lot of goodness there. You're welcome."

            "name": "Jon Freier",
            "content": "Yes, Mike. Thank you. And yes on March 16th as most of you know we took this big bold decision, one of the quickest decisions in our space to close the majority of our retail stores about 80% of our company-owned stores. And rather than just kind of sit there on the sideline and just let nature take its course, we went into action to take a number of our retail employees and convert them to virtual retail mobile experts, meaning that when you go to tmobile.com, you can chat from a -- click a button chat with an expert and be able to learn more about T-Mobile, be able to add lines to your account. We had a lot of people that, of course, in a remote learning environment and a virtual learning environment a number of people had to take action to support those learning environments for children on that home. So we wanted to continue to be there while our stores were closed. We saw a 500% increase in the number of people that we typically have in virtual retail by converting our mobile experts that typically work in stores to that virtual retail environment and continue to serve customers in that way. And then also from a curbside delivery perspective we didn't have that capability prior to COVID-19 and working with Toni Stanford [ph] and his product and technology team, we were able to kind of stand up this curbside delivery capability within all of our company-owned stores that we have up and running today. And that is, okay, I can continue to talk to T-Mobile through the app through chat and be able to walk through a transaction and be able to pick that up at a store in a contactless kind of a way. So I couldn't be more proud of these capabilities that got turned in a rapid fashion to continue to serve customers. And I got to tell you our team in all of our stores, Callie Field's team and all of customer care, we've said this once and probably million times, but let me just say million and one times. We just had the best frontline teams in the entire country maybe even on the face of the planet. I just couldn't be more proud of the heroism of our teams to move fast continue to be there to serve customers and keep the business continuity of this company going. Yes. Braxton, I will just reiterate exactly what you said. We're working this really hard. And I think Mike Sievert had an opportunity to say that, the last couple of calls that, one of the benefits of this transaction taking a little bit longer to finally getting approved and to cross the finish line is that, we've had a longer runway to plan. And that's exactly what we're seeing. We've had a number of discussions with independently owned and operated operators around store closures. We're working through that, have been working through that, have gotten through them very very quickly. Also we have a lot of integration, internal integration efforts that we're doing that we once thought would be impossible, because we're not physically together. We're having to do all of this work virtually, but I've just been incredibly pleased about the amount of interactions that we can do with the team virtually. We've got tens of thousands of employees across the country in retail between the two legacy companies that we're bringing together. And that's just gone incredibly well thus far, in terms of having people do the necessary training, getting people up to speed on installing our systems into the legacy Sprint stores, taking legacy Sprint systems installing them into legacy Magenta stores. So that we can say, yes, we can help you no matter if you're a T-Mobile customer or a Sprint-branded customer, regardless of the store that you visit. So we are in a really good place, call it six weeks, not even six weeks, five-and-a-half weeks into this integration after close. So we're very confident. We're moving fast. We're ahead of schedule in terms of the discussions that we've had. We're very bullish on realizing our distribution-related synergies this year. And we're looking forward to showing you some results here very soon."

            "name": "Matt Staneff",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mike for the question. As Mike Sievert just said, we saw a pretty rapid slowdown in our business because we took these proactive measures around retail stores for the health and safety of our employees and customers in general. And the market had a pronounced decline right off the gate. And what you're seeing what we're seeing in the marketplace right now is generally consistent with what you're hearing in the news and in other places is that things are starting to rebound and things are starting to turn a corner. It was closed down and slowed for quite a while in the first part of the month. We're seeing generally speaking some of the categories that you naturally would expect to react in a marketplace like this so it's to rebound faster interpret that as the prepaid market is starting to rebound a little bit more. There's stimulus money in the marketplace. Consumers are coming out and starting to shop again and switch. And as Mike said, we really enjoy a marketplace where there's a lot of industry switching and that's important for us to continue to grow our net adds as we move forward. So we're starting to see some signs that the marketplace is rebounding in the areas I've talked about, but we've got a long way to go to get back to normal levels of industry switching and consumer buying behavior as we see this thing out throughout the quarter. We've also seen some particular strength in some of the other areas public sector is an example. Lots of students need connectivity on learning and things of that nature. So we've been pretty active in participating in those parts of the markets as well."

            "content": "Yes. I'll pick it up. So, great to see Simon, and as you referenced I mean the 2.5-gigahertz rollout is absolutely key, right? I mean, that's the material spectrum advantage we now have in this mid-band 5G space. Mike outlined north of 300 megahertz of sub-6 gig spectrum for T-Mobile and nobody and the team is more eager than me and my team to get this stuff rolled out. So we didn't sit on our hands during the pendency of the deal. We've got stuff into leasing and zoning activity. And we were building 2.5 in Philly parts of New York before the deal closed actually. And so we were able to turn some of that stuff up immediately on close and that we just referenced New York and 2.5 rollout coming online this week. And to your question on broadband and fixed, I mean that 2.5-gigahertz spectrum is the critical piece. As we start to ramp that rollout that's going to build capacity specifically great 5G capacity for us to start serving our customers not just with the traditional mobility and wireless service that we're killing it with, but also one in this broadband space. And it takes some time. Obviously, we're not rolling out -- I wish we could roll out 2.5 overnight. It's going to take us months and into years to get that program fully complete across the nation. But as we do that and as capacity becomes available then we'll start to look at delivering that broadband capability to our customers as we've outlined in our deal advocacy and our business plans. It's a very material part of how we see shaping the competitive landscape as we move forward. Probably not too much this year, but I'm hopeful that we'll be making some inroads next year and beyond. I wish I could say it would all happen this week. But yes to both questions I mean we're just getting started but we're delighted to make this start. I mean we are literally as Mike said earlier on; we're five weeks into this combination with Sprint. And we're already deploying. So, I think coming out -- we were determined to come out of the blocks super quick. I don't think many folks anticipated we would be deploying the 2.5-gig spectrum so quickly but we have made a start and we're starting in big cities. Here's a fun stat for you all. If you look at the square miles of just what we launched in Philly and we built and put that on air inside really the 30 days of March through the deal. But if you look at the square miles of that footprint in metro Philly, it's approximately two, two and a half times the entire footprint of Verizon's millimeter wave 5G on a nationwide basis. So, they've been rolling this 5G thing out they say for I don't know two years. But in a month I mean we more than doubled the footprint. And yes, I mean mid-band 5G versus millimeter wave we're just going to kill it from a coverage perspective. So, we're moving. We're moving quickly. I mean we're in the key markets in the Northeast that's a big focus for us. I'll give a shout out obviously to my team to the Ericsson guys who've done a great job making this happen. And more importantly, as we look forward, we will launch and build out and lay 2.5-gigahertz spectrum across thousands of sites in 2020. We're off to a great start benefiting from that work from last year which we did at risk. And the rollout of 2.5 is going to move super super-quick. So, we've managed through COVID to deal with permitting delays et cetera. Obviously our teams are working with safety and their health as a paramount and primary concern. But the federal air cover we have as a critical service provider has been key. We actually built over 1,000 sites this last month of April rolling out new spectrum onto those sites. And our plan is to ramp very heavily as we move into this month of May and on through the year. So, lots of 2.5 gig coming. New York, Philly all of the northeast markets very much in our sights as are most of the major metros across the U.S. So, a lot more moves to come and we'll keep everybody posted. New York just turned up as Mike said and Ronald asked. And there were folks running around in New York looking and testing of that I assume observing social distancing and shelter-at-home protocols but I saw some stuff on social with 600 even 700 megabit per second speeds. And so this is with a very limited volume of 2.5-gigahertz spectrum rolled out at this point in time 40 to 60 megahertz. And remember we have secured with the combination with Sprint about 150. So, we have a long way to go in terms of the performance capability, but what we have on the ground is just incredibly exciting. So, key to our deal and key to that consumer experience that we're going to roll out aggressively as we move through the balance of this year. Yes absolutely. And again Mike in terms of momentum and integration work I mean kudos to John Sore [ph] and Prasad [ph] and the team I mean we turned up nationwide LTE roaming across all of our sites effectively on 4/1 data clubs. So, all the work ahead of time to make sure that could happen. And what does that mean? It means that the Sprint postpaid customer base when they -- wherever they fall off the Sprint network be that in a rural geography or in building location in Manhattan or wherever it may be, they can now see the T-Mobile network. We know that that network churn was a key driver of the overall churn within Sprint and we're seeing big uptake. I mean on a weekly basis, we're seeing approximately around 10 million unique roamers. I don't like the term roaming, but Sprint customers now leveraging the T-Mobile network. So that's more than one-third of the postpaid phone subscriber base that we have with Sprint. So a lot of uptake. And then just within the last week or so we've activated and provided access for nationwide 5G on our low band. And that footprint is growing every day 250 million pops. We just launched the Bay Area. I mean so that footprint which is the foundational layer to the layer cake of our 5G strategy that's growing like a weed. I mean the teams have been knocking it out of the park building out 600 and our Sprint customers with a 5G-capable phone and now getting access to that footprint too. So lots of dimensions very, very focused on making sure that all of our Sprint customers are getting the best they can from that combination of the Sprint and T-Mobile network. Yes. So thanks John. We doubled our speeds. I mean, I think the additional 600 was great the kind of country and our customers needed it during COVID-19. We've, obviously, extended our pledge commitment. We are working with many of those 600 providers to see if they will extend. I'm hopeful they will and continue to enable us to better serve our customers during this period. So more capacity and more speed is exactly what was needed and allowed us to deal with a lot of peaks and increases in traffic that we saw on the network during a very difficult time. So big shout out and thank you to the FCC and Chairman Pai and also the holders that loaned us their spectrum. And as I said, we're hopeful they'll extend a little longer with us as the pledge continues. So I'll hit these quick, Jennifer. So our model has been a leased fiber model. We generally do not build fiber to our sites. We let others do that and we get great prices from them for the services we need. And we've been scaling our backhaul for a 5G world for some time. And the performance we're seeing out of these sites we're upgrading with just limited volumes of 2.5 spectrum today are all supported by multi-gig backhaul. And so, we're in a very strong place on that and our providers will continue to drive a lot of intense competition in that space with our model. So that looks to continue on. On DSS, yes, I think, my comments last call seem to -- was there a big discussion in the industry on DSS. And do I feel a lot better? Not really. I was very clear on that call that one vendor is trailing and they're still kind of trailing. So I think the sum of it is, DSS is going to happen. We've heard from our competition and similar to us something will happen this year. But the key message Jennifer is, we're not dependent on DSS for our 5G rollout. And our nationwide footprint is there already. And it's growing at a tremendous pace, as I mentioned earlier in the call. And that's the way to rollout 5G with fiber spectrum not having to share the spectrum with LTE users of between LTE users and 5G users. And our position our wealth of spectrum provides us a wealth of that cover in terms of not having to be reliant on DSS. Now that said, we will deploy the technology. But it's still bumpy."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Well, thanks a lot Jud, and thanks to everybody for joining in. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call coming to you live mostly from our living rooms and home offices and maybe a few kitchens across the country. And let me just start by saying, what a crazy quarter this was, and I think a really proud moment in history for our team. Over the last couple of months, we've closed one of the largest telecom mergers in history, after fighting for it for over two years. And we started by making immediate progress on our integration work to unlock the value of this combination. We transitioned our CEO office, we established a new leadership team for the company and we completely reinvented how we serve our customers, all during a global pandemic and all at an incredibly fast pace. And through it all we did it while posting some pretty fantastic business results, which is what we're here to talk with you about today. Okay. We've got a lot of ground to cover. I plan to share some early insights and thoughts about the New T-Mobile touch on the impacts of COVID-19, cover some highlights from Q1 and of course brag about some of those early wins that Neville and his team are already delivering on our network, including some really fast work the team has done to roll out our 2.5 gigahertz spectrum from Sprint in Philadelphia and in New York onto the T-Mobile network. Then Braxton will unpack the financials and we'll share some guidance for Q2. Amazingly, it's been just five weeks since finally closing our merger with Sprint and let me tell you, we're incredibly fired up about the opportunity ahead. While the process took way longer than anyone could have imagined, we took advantage of every moment during the approval process for this deal to plan for a rapid integration of these companies and we've hit the ground running. As we dig into our combined businesses, we see an opportunity to move even faster and potentially to unlock even more synergies from this combination than originally planned, opportunities like the acceleration of our retail rationalization and network integration. And we'll likely see additional upside from our increased scale in areas like procurement and potentially faster improvements in the churn rate of Sprint subscribers than planned. There's been a lot of talk about the changing landscape that we all find ourselves in right now. And I can say this about it. The value proposition and unprecedented network that we'll deliver will position New T-Mobile incredibly well to serve even more customers, particularly as the economic environment continues to change. I've said it before, and I'll say it again today, customers are not going to have to choose between a better value or a better network. With the New T-Mobile customers will finally get both. Before we dive into the results, I do want to highlight, how our company has navigated the impacts of COVID-19 so far. The way our people and this team has responded to support customers has been nothing short of heroic. And I couldn't be prouder of each and every one of them. The crisis has highlighted how crucial connectivity has become to our daily lives. And as it's unfolded in front of us, we took immediate steps to ensure our customers would continue to stay connected, while working hard to simultaneously protect the health and safety of our employees. We were one of the first to take bold steps to do our part to help mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 with wide-scale temporary store closures and transitioning employees to work remotely, including 14,000 U.S.-based care employees from T-Mobile and Sprint. We utilized our digital capabilities to enable things like virtual retail, and we introduced curbside and mobile fulfillment. Through all this transition, our frontline employees have stepped up big to support our customers and continue to deliver the industry-leading customer service that makes us different. And that has translated into record-high NPS satisfaction scores. Right out of the gate, we knew that our network would see increases in demand and changes in usage patterns. So we took immediate action to increase capacity, including temporarily doubling our 600 megahertz capacity and expanding roaming for Sprint customers. Our network has performed phenomenally, delivering excellent reliability for our customers. In fact, according to OpenSignal average LTE download speeds on our 600 megahertz spectrum actually increased significantly even during this crisis, after we layered on the additional 600-megahertz capacity. We're also a proud supporter of the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge, and I really appreciate the work the Chairman, Pai and the FCC have done to bring the entire communications industry together during this crisis. As a result of our commitment, we've waived late fees and maintained service for our consumer and small business customers impacted by COVID-19, regardless of their ability to pay. Additionally, in the early phases of the crisis, we chose to lift smartphone high-speed data caps made additional smartphone mobile hotspot data available and accelerated the launch of T-Mobile Connect to support our customers, as they navigate the impacts of COVID-19. We've also donated millions of dollars through a number of initiatives to support our communities from support for Feeding America to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, local schools and programs for our frontline health care workers. I'm really proud of what this team is doing to help across the country. While this pandemic is definitely not over, we'll continue to take the necessary steps to support our customers and do what's right for our employees and communities as things start to reopen. This will result in some continued near-term impacts to our business. Stores that have been closed temporarily obviously reduced our store traffic and subsequent retail volumes. And that impacts customer additions, service revenues and equipment revenues in the very short-term. We also introduced some operational changes to help with business continuity, which has impacted our overall performance in the latter part of the first quarter and will likely continue in the second quarter. As the nation starts to emerge post COVID-19, customers across the industry will likely be looking for better value in a tougher economic environment and we'll continue to be there for our customers when they need us most. It's who we are and it's what our Un-carrier brand stands for. I expect that AT&T and Verizon customers will most certainly be looking to get out from under their high monthly bills in search of a better value. And it's likely there will also be an increase in churn from today's low levels as the carriers won't be able to keep themselves from squeezing customers who are already budget constrained. These factors will likely mean more switching across the industry as things change, and we will be there to help. We know from the past that T-Mobile does disproportionately well in an environment with larger pool of switchers. We're a proven share taker, and I intend to keep it that way. We will be there for our customers with prepaid and postpaid products that are geared to their needs, particularly in a time of constrained budgets. And we expect to consolidate our marketing and new offers under the T-Mobile brand later this summer, just as this switching opportunity starts to come to life. Okay. Time for a few T-Mobile stand-alone highlights from Q1. Let's start with our main business driver, branded postpaid phones, where we once again led the industry in growth with 452,000 net customer additions in Q1. Not that I'm counting, but that's 25 quarters in a row of leading the industry, this time with about 70% of the combined industry growth, which is approximately double the sum total of the rest of the industry combined including Big Cable. Total branded postpaid net additions were 777,000. And prepaid net losses were 128,000, yielding 649,000 total branded net adds for the quarter. One of the things I'm most proud of is our customer experience obsession at this company, which in part shows up in our branded postpaid phone churn numbers. We posted a record Q1 low of 0.86%, down 2 basis points versus last year and down 15 bps versus last quarter. I'm also really proud of our team's ability to deliver our financial results, while simultaneously taking care of our customers and employees during these difficult times. We've said it for years, investing in customers leads to customer growth, which leads to revenue growth, which if we run the company well leads to EBITDA and cash flow growth, which we invest right back into our customers and their network experience, which is what started the success cycle in the first place. Our financial results in Q1 show that this winning formula continues to benefit consumers and shareholders alike. Service revenues in Q1 hit an all-time high of $8.7 billion, up 5% year-over-year, more than twice the growth rate of the next best big provider. Adjusted EBITDA also hit an all-time record high of $3.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year despite the environment created by COVID-19. Free cash flow, excluding payments for merger-related costs, was $893 million, up 37% year-over-year. Now let's talk about the foundation of our New T-Mobile growth story, our network. Despite COVID-19, Neville and his team are hard at work expanding the network footprint and quality and continue making incredible progress. Our network continues to perform. And that's being amplified as we integrate Sprint's spectrum, putting us on our path to build the world's best 5G network. The whole process will take about three years to complete, but our team was able to take advantage of the extended approval cycle to get moving on a lot of the site leasing and permitting work ahead of time. Combining the spectrum holdings of T-Mobile and Sprint, the New T-Mobile controls 319 megahertz of combined low-band and mid-band spectrum nationwide, 319 megahertz. New T-Mobile's combined low and mid-band spectrum is nearly double that of AT&T and nearly triple that of Verizon. It's no wonder they spent the last two years fighting the merger behind the scenes. And while AT&T and Verizon are depending on millimeter wave spectrum for their 5G strategy. Well, we have that too with over 1,000 megahertz of millimeter wave spectrum more than AT&T. We're ready to leapfrog the carriers and network capability. And you know what? They know it. In fact, we've already started deploying our 2.5-gigahertz spectrum on the T-Mobile network and Philadelphia is already live with peak speeds of over 600 megabits per second in our tests. And just yesterday we went live in New York City as well. And there will be many more other cities we'll light up in 2020 and beyond. For Sprint customers, we're delivering an enhanced network experience by significantly expanding access to the T-Mobile network to improve coverage as well as 5G availability. More than 80% of the Sprint postpaid phone base has compatible handsets today, and we are seeing a big increase in weekly roaming on the T-Mobile network as a result. Finally, we remain hard at work on all the network projects, you heard us talk about over the past year. Recall that, we launched America's first nationwide 5G network on 600-megahertz spectrum in early December, covering more than 200 million people right out of the gate. We have 215 million people covered with 5G today, recently lighting up 5G in Detroit, St. Louis, Columbus, Ohio, and just this week we turned up the Bay Area of California as well. So before I hand it over to Braxton, let me just say this. In the face of unprecedented adversity, we delivered another record setting quarter while simultaneously driving changes across our business to deliver for our customers and close one of the largest telecom mergers in history. We rose to the occasion and hit the ground running in our first five weeks as the New T-Mobile. We feel more confident than ever about our ability to unlock the massive synergy potential of this transaction and we already see opportunities for upside to our plans. Our passionate, fired-up workforce is focused on one singular mission being the absolute best at serving customers. The success of this business depends on it, and we're moving rapidly to drive innovation in this industry and supercharge competition. As we start to emerge from COVID-19 and look ahead, T-Mobile is a brand that's the best positioned to stand up for customers and deliver a great value combined with an amazing network right when they need it most. And with that, it's now time to ask our CFO, Braxton Carter to take us through the financials and guidance. Braxton take it away. Well, sure. Yes Simon, I have to say that one of the things we're most excited about is as I said in my remarks upfront is that after five weeks as one team, if anything we see more potential to go faster and to go bigger on synergy attainment and growth than we had been expecting. And there's a number of reasons for that. Among them the fact that we see opportunities to move faster on certain things like network. We had a long time to prepare for this merger. And we lift a lot of track when it comes to permitting and leasing and we're moving fast. And as we start to knock this down, it does appear that there's going to be a pace to this that may be able to stay ahead of schedule relative to our now two-year-old plans that calculated up all these synergies. Retail rationalization might go faster than expected. We had always expected to get after marketing one brand pretty quickly but getting the retail fleets rationalized due to systems issues and people issues, et cetera was something we always thought would take a little bit more time. We may be able to move faster and that could accelerate synergies. Procurement looks like an area of possibility to exceed plan. On the customer side, the churn level of Sprint customers is one of the most financially sensitive things. And we certainly have hopes that we can see faster movement there as we tackle this network integration at a faster pace. Already we've lit up more roaming for Sprint customers than we had expected to be able to do and we're starting to see how they respond to that. And you know what? They like it, which is great. So we're not in a position to guide on it or to give you anything concrete yet. I can just tell you that, five weeks in we're really optimistic. And you saw from our print today that, standalone business is very strong. You saw our Sprint subscriber numbers a couple of days ago. Those were better than most people expected. So we also walked into this with some momentum. Now as Braxton pointed out, COVID took a bite out of that for everybody. And there are temporary impacts on our business. But you know what? They're just that temporary. And our view is that if anything there's opportunity in the environment that we're going to see when social distancing lifts. As I said in my remarks, people are going to be looking for value. They're really going to be hungry to make sure they've got the right value. They're not going to drop this category. I mean, no way. This category is so important, but they might be asking if they've got the right carrier. And if switching comes and is elevated versus these low levels, we will be prepared to stand up and give customers what they're looking for. So we're feeling very optimistic. Even though it's the premise of your question, look, there's some aspects to it that have knocked everybody in this industry off their stride. Comparatively speaking, we feel very good. And over the mid and long-term, we perhaps feel even better than our deal model that we contemplated two years ago. Your second question, I think was for Neville and I might follow-up too about the network conditions and as it relates to broadband, right? Simon the cable companies are good companies. They're good people, but it's the least competitive market in the history of man. I mean, everybody knows that. And so to us as you know you know how we're wired. I mean, we're competitors. And as Neville says, we're itching to get in there, because we've got a value proposition that I think is going to resonate with millions of people to be able to bring 5G-based home Internet access to people that have never had a choice, never one single choice for many of them. And man, that's going to be fun. So we've got to get the network in condition. As Neville said, it's more next year and beyond than this year, but we're rearing to go, and we see a very big opportunity to change that landscape in that market forever. Great. Thanks a lot. Okay. Hi, Brett. Well, I'll take the first one. And yes, Brett. As you know the number one driver of churn for any carrier and particularly for Sprint is network. And that's what drives people away more than anything. Network. And then the second one is value. And then you bump those two key drivers of churn up against the value proposition that we're building, we're building the best network at the best value. No one's ever been able to offer that before, the lowest prices and the best network. And those are why people churn bar none. That's it. Those are the top two out of two. So I can't predict for you how fast that will dawn on Sprint customers, as we start to give them at their incredible rate plans, the best network in the country. But they're going to turn out, because of this merger to be some of the smartest shoppers this industry has, because we're not going to force them to change their rate plans. We're going to honor those rate plans. And yet we're going to serve them up the best network that this industry's ever seen. And so we're starting to see some benefits of that already and people like it. So that's great. But we've got a lot of work to do. To your point about rate plans, we don't think we have all that much tuning up to do. It turns out that the differences between Sprint ARPU and T-Mobile ARPU, don't have much to do with the fact that Sprint's prices are higher. It has to do with artifacts like, T-Mobile has more lines per account, and therefore more added lines on average than Sprint does, and a different penetration of business, and different numbers of unlimited customers, other artifacts, but not really a dynamic that would suggest that Sprint's prices are higher. So I can't wait to get at it. As we talked about, we're going to start to unify this summer under one T-Mobile flagship brand with an integrated retail fleet and integrated brand that we're going to do everything we can to get that network experience tuned up for Sprint customers faster than they expect. And I think we're going to like what we see from all that. Thank you. So, let's go over to Twitter since this is a Twitter conference. And again you can send us questions #TMUS or @MikeSievert. Neville let's bring you into the conversation. Walt Piecyk has a question. Actually there's two questions you might address simultaneously. Walt says what percent of macro have 2.5 gigahertz in the city Neville. I assume he's talking about New York. And then Ronald @ronald_809, I love this one because again we launched last night. Okay. We launched last night in New York City the first example of our full-layer cake. Hey Neville when will the new T-Mobile layer cake expand to fully cover NYC like the Bronx and Queens and Staten Island didn't you leave out parts of Brooklyn? So, how about it Neville? And Neville while you're on a roll I ask this at some risk and peril because I know you're enthusiastic. But I responded to Brett's question a little bit by discussing the roaming situation and we're getting questions now on the site. Could you tell us more about what's the roaming experience like for Sprint customers how much of it is happening? And roaming itself is kind of a funny turn because they're all our customers. But we're essentially using roaming technology while we operate two networks. Can you just very briefly touch on the day-to-day experience that Sprint customers are experiencing now that we've turned that up so extensively? Well, thanks everyone. That's all the time we have. Thanks for joining us today. Operator let's take the next question from the phone queue. Hi, Mike. Braxton, let's start with you on the -- what's included and how to think about the cost. And then maybe Matt and I can tag team on what we're seeing in the marketplace. Yes. The second piece, we're a share taker. And a share taker likes a competitive environment with a certain amount of churn. Everybody's been home and churn itself has fallen quite a bit. And so obviously, we like an environment where people are able and have less friction to being able to switch providers. And notwithstanding that we've been competing very hard and finding really innovative ways to get that done. So we were killing it in January and February. And then, of course, things came to a pretty fast stop in March. We were quicker to execute slowdowns and shutdowns of our retail in March. We felt it was very important to be decisive. We're based here in Seattle where the whole thing started and we took it probably more seriously than others did. So we moved faster. And we may have been more effective in March than some. All that has equalized now. But Matt, why don't you give us a little color on what you're seeing? And then very briefly I may ask Jon to talk a little bit about virtual retail and curbside and some of the things happening to mitigate market environment from Matt Staneff. We're not waiting for the market to just return to normal. We're changing how we operate. Jon Freier just very briefly about the rapid work we've done to change what retail means in this company. Hey, John. Okay. I'm going to try to hit those pretty fast. So first of all on the first piece, no, we expect postpaid phones to be positive, not negative. And we're seeing nice trends develop. So we gave the guidance that we gave. I'm very hopeful that we'll see strength through the rest of the quarter. And it does assume that we continue to see some increasing momentum slowly happening through the quarter as social distancing ebbs a bit. But it doesn't assume a wholesale change in customer behavior. We would assume that June would have more going on than May and May more than April, but not step changes. And Neville, do you want to hit the second one very quickly? Hey, Phil. Yes. We did -- yes, I was just going to jump in. We didn't quantify it but that's because we work with every customer. A big piece of how we operate is -- and this may be different for us than some of our competitors because part of our core competency is working with people on very tight budgets and who occasionally have difficult circumstances. And a part of our normal is having to deal with every customer and find a way to meet their needs and we've carried on doing that. Callie Field and team have carried on doing that while having to move 15,000 people to work from home, 92% of our workforce. And so we're honoring the pledge and it's costly. I'm not trying to say it's not incremental. It is costly. But it's hard to count every individual customer because a big part of this is you treat those customers. And we're not going to disconnect them but we are going to encourage them not to stack up bills that they can't afford and to make sure they're on a product and service that they can afford. And our team of customer care heroes are just fantastic at that. And they've stepped up and found new ways of working under Callie's leadership. I'm so proud of them. But it's very difficult for us to quantify in those kinds of numbers. What we have done is make sure you understand the total potential financial tally. Let's go to Twitter and then two more from the phone. And just fair warning for everybody, I will have to step away for the last few minutes of the call. Braxton will be emceeing for us. But I don't want to ignore Twitter. And for example Bill Ho is asking about enterprise, looking ahead to integrating and ramping up T-Mobile Business Group. Mike Katz, Mike Sievert what's the thinking on Enterprise segment growth and competition? Is it low-hanging fruit? By the way we keep talking about day one being mid-summer. We're talking about consumer for that part. Mike Katz and his enterprise team have already achieved day 1 integrating an entire combined Sprint and T-Mobile selling force behind one value proposition under the T-Mobile brand. That was achieved just this week. We're getting off to the races. I'm really proud of what the team's doing and how fast they're forming to capture this opportunity. And Mike I don't know if you want to very briefly give a little bit of color on what you're seeing. Okay operator. We will take one final question here."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to the T-Mobile Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. It may cause \u2013 forward-looking or may cause actual results to differ materially, which we have in our SEC filings and I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our Q4 and full year results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics are all available on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Well, my buddy and I here are excited to be here today to discuss another remarkable year at T-Mobile. We shared with you a year ago that 2021 would be a foundational year for us as a merged company, a year in which we set bold goals for ourselves in terms of customer growth, profitability, network leadership and merger integration. Well, we not only exceeded our own targets, but also Wall Street's expectations. We are experiencing the greatest growth momentum in our history, setting record customer growth and service revenue growth, all because of the important investments we've made and will continue to make in our network leadership and in underpenetrated markets. This momentum sets us up for a very strong 2022 with plans to deliver another year of industry-leading postpaid growth, 10% in core adjusted EBITDA and over 30% growth in free cash flow at the midpoint of our guidance. We have big aspirations for this year, as Peter will explain more about in a minute. Our historic network build is a driving force behind our growth opportunity and it's central to unlocking our merger synergies. For the second year in a row, we set an audacious goal for Neville and the technology team, and they crushed it yet again. We set our sights on getting ultra capacity 5G to 200 million people and the team blew right past that goal, reaching 210 million in 2021. This is no small feat when you consider that it takes roughly 3x the number of cell site upgrades to get from 100 million to 200 million. And that gives you a sense of the challenge that AT&T and Verizon have ahead of them. Once they woke up to our 5G lead and differentiation, they finally began lighting up mid-band 5G POPs, but still only tens of millions compared to our hundreds of millions. According to their own build plan, it will take them multiple years to reach 200 million people, and they still won't be anywhere near the depth of mid-band spectrum that we're putting to work across our larger footprint. This demonstrates the remarkable deployment machine that we have spent years building and how hard it is to replicate. And don't forget our extended-range 5G reached 94% of all Americans at the end of 2021 with speeds double that of typical LTE. This reinforces the importance of not just having the best spectrum portfolio, but how quickly T-Mobile puts spectrum to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. We continue to add to our mid-band portfolio with our recent purchase in Auction 110. Once again, our prudent and opportunistic approach meant that we concentrated on supplementing our mid-band spectrum holdings in major urban and suburban areas, mostly aligned with our C-band purchases and importantly in places where these frequencies are well suited to the density of our network grid. That means we'll be able to deliver meaningful customer benefit with very little network capital and OpEx using existing towers, thanks to our completed agreements with American Tower and Crown Castle and we're not slowing down. We continue to extend our year's long 5G lead on the competition, and independent network experts continue to recognize this. More than 20 reports from third-party testing firms in the last year confirmed T-Mobile is tops in 5G speeding coverage. In Ookla's latest testing, T-Mobile delivered a clean suite of every category and we're not just talking about individual 5G category wins like speed and availability. This is important. T-Mobile also won for overall network performance meaning customers have a winning experience on the T-Mobile network period. Opensignal's new report published last week states that T-Mobile customers enjoy the fastest 5G speeds and can connect to 5G more often and in more places than anyone else. And the gap has only gotten wider as we keep increasing our speeds and reach. Meanwhile, AT&T somehow managed to see their 5G speeds get slower year-over-year with an LTE like 49 megabits per second. Okay. Let's talk about our industry-leading growth. Last year, we posted the best growth in our company's history. Across the entire span of our years' long Un-carrier journey, our best postpaid net add growth ever was in 2021. Our Magenta brand momentum is just incredible. And we added 1.2 million postpaid account net adds, doubling 2020's adds, the highest reported in the industry yet again. This measure of total billing relationships is the best barometer of winning the switching decisions in the industry, something we're famous for as the Un-carrier. And our highest-ever postpaid net adds were 5.5 million, leading the industry for the seventh consecutive year and exceeding the guidance that we raised again just last quarter. And our 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds were up 32% from last year, even during our accelerated Sprint customer integration. Thanks to the strength of our Magenta brand, we're delivering at best-ever levels. Our Magenta postpaid phone churn in 2021 was the lowest in the industry for the second year in a row. We exited the year with great momentum as well. In Q4, we not only had the highest phone gross adds in the industry, but also the highest in our history. This last quarter, interesting fact, our Magenta postpaid porting ratio was above 1.5x in Q4, and we're seeing those ratios trend even higher against AT&T and Verizon so far in Q1, while seeing our overall phone churn so far in Q1 move down seasonally just as expected. And to put this underlying momentum into perspective, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q4 would have been closer to 1.4 million and would represent the highest quarterly postpaid phone net adds in our history. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where T-Mobile was the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry in Q4. Let me say that again. In Q4, T-Mobile, and not Comcast, not Charter or AT&T or Verizon, posted the most broadband net adds in the industry, and we're just getting started. And mobile customers are taking our Magenta MAX plan in record numbers with over 55% of new customers choosing our best plan. This wasn't part of our playbook before and is now a tailwind as our continuously improving network perception and competitive device offers are enticing customers right to the top of our rate card. And there's still a huge potential upside here as fewer than 15% of our postpaid phone customers are on Magenta MAX or equivalent plans. This affects ARPU and ARPA. When we shared our plan with you at Analyst Day last year, we assumed postpaid phone ARPU would decline 1% every year through 2023, consistent with our historical trends and any benefit from the Magenta MAX would be upside to the plan. Well, you're already seeing that upside as we just delivered flat ARPU, actually up $0.01 in 2021. And not to steal Peter's thunder, but on the strength of this trend, we now see postpaid phone ARPU being flat to slightly up in 2022 for the first time ever. In addition, we've seen our prime mix of credit apps increase year-over-year every quarter in 2021, showing that our network and brand is consistently attracting some of the industry's best customers. We're off to a great start, bringing the same winning formula to smaller markets and rural areas. This is 40% of the country where we haven't meaningfully played before. We're growing our presence here as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. In just one year, our share has grown from approximately 13% to roughly 15%. Our share of port-ins in smaller markets and rural areas has increased multiple percentage points year-over-year, and these markets accounted for more than a third of our new accounts. This is one place our network leadership is beginning to shine. We're already the only 5G game in town for many of these communities. Our extended range 5G provides speeds more than double the average LTE and reaches nearly five times more geographic coverage than Verizon's 5G. And we're rapidly rolling out our Ultra Capacity 5G to more of these communities at an unprecedented clip, expanding our mid-band 5G coverage to five times the land area that we cover today. By the end of next year as we move from 210 million people covered to over 300 million exiting 2023. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon have finally started rolling out mid-band 5G and hope to soon be where we were almost two years ago. I'll say it again, we're two years ahead of AT&T and Verizon in 5G and two years from now will still be two years ahead. T-Mobile for Business had another great year as enterprise and government customers continue to do hands-on testing and when they do, they see the strength of our network. This differentiation on the network experience is delivering win share well above our market share. Just to put that in perspective, we're already, today, at a win share in enterprise and government that would get us to our targeted 20% market share by 2025, that's if we just hold our win share at current levels. And we've still got room to run. We're in many ways just beginning the expansion of our solutions and capabilities. Last week, others said they were still in proof-of-concept for advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks that they hope to commercialize at some point in the future. At T-Mobile, we already have commercial, revenue-generating agreements for advanced 5G solutions with multiple large corporations, including the federal government and a very large logistics company. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our ever-expanding 5G network lead. And let me just go back and touch just a little bit more on high-speed Internet. At the beginning of 2021, we were actually still in pilot. While we closed out the year with 646,000 customers, far exceeding our 500,000 target, it's abundantly clear that customers are loving the network performance and the simplicity of this 5G-based product. And with roughly 40% of high-speed Internet customers being new to T-Mobile, it creates another front door to fuel our mobile growth. We're excited about the revenue and margin contribution potential of this business as we ramp up further this year and next as our planned network capacity really hits its pace. T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is ready for its prime-time moment. And I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by how mainstream this product really is with our unique 5G network capacity to back it up. Okay, let's touch on our progress on our accelerated merger integration. While our Magenta business is firing on all cylinders, we're also successfully powering through the transition of the higher-churning Sprint customers faster than planned. At our Analyst Day last year, we laid out our post-merger plan to accelerate our integration, bringing many of our biggest milestones forward by a year or more. The Sprint customer network migration is an essential part of this integration. At the end of 2021, 64% of Sprint customers have been migrated onto the T-Mobile network, well ahead of the 60% target that we laid out back at Analyst Day. This is impressive in one year when you consider that less than 10% were migrated at the end of 2020. As we've previously said, we expect the billing migration to be relatively seamless to the customer as we begin to ramp up this final part of the integration over the course of 2022 and into the first half of 2023. As we enter the home stretch in 2022 for many of our Sprint customer integration initiatives, we believe that Q4 of 2021 was the high watermark for churn, in terms of our overall postpaid phone churn during the integration. Having seen the integration results so far, we're now confident that churn will improve because we've seen the performance of a now material cohort of migrations. As customers migrate to fully compatible devices anchored on the T-Mobile network and have a new EIP instead of leasing, they show churn rates similar to our Magenta customers. A sizable minority of Sprint customers have now hit these milestones. Completing these upgrades and migrations won't happen overnight, but the bottom line is simple. While others are temporarily padding their net adds from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short lived, which will create a growth tailwind for us, as you saw from our underlying Magenta performance while simultaneously creating a corresponding headwind for them. And we like those kinds of trends. Okay. Finally, before I wrap up, I do want to touch on our accomplishments as a leading corporate citizen in our industry. We not only set and exceeded our bold business and financial goals in 2021. We also stayed true to our commitments to use our new network, scale and resources for good, building a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for all of our stakeholders. T-Mobile was the first telecom to commit to sourcing 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy. And we're proud to announce this week that we're the first to achieve that goal, just another example of where we're leading the industry. We also further extended our leadership position in helping to bridge the digital divide. We're removing economic and geographic barriers in multiple ways. Our centerpiece is Project 10Million, which has already connected 3.2 million students with free or subsidized service. And we're expanding our high-speed Internet availability to millions of rural households, providing an important new connectivity option right where it's needed most. We also have an active participation in the government's affordable connectivity program through Metro by T-Mobile and Assurance Wireless, providing lower cost subsidized connectivity for many at a time when it's needed most. Okay. So let me sum it up. 2021 was our best year ever, and that's just because 2022 hasn't happened yet. Our positioning to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value is working while we also rushed to successfully expand into big underpenetrated segments. We saw strong ongoing growth ahead. We see it ahead in 2022 with a strategy that is really resonating with customers. Our network excellence has unlocked unprecedented growth for our Magenta brand, allowing us to move upmarket in urban and suburban areas with prime consumers and with enterprises and government. And at the same time, we've expanded our reach into smaller markets and rural areas and new product categories like high-speed Internet. We delivered big milestones in each of these areas in 2021 that really demonstrate our growth thesis with results. That customer growth helped to deliver industry-leading service revenue growth, and combined with our accelerated execution on our merger synergies, has enabled us to nearly double our free cash flow year-over-year in 2021. Only T-Mobile has this unique recipe with permission to win and room to run across multiple paths to unlock the massive shareholder value potential of this business. I'm incredibly excited to carry our momentum into 2022. This is a huge year, and there's no team I'd rather tackle it with. So, Peter, over to you.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our strong results in 2021 highlighted our unique ability to leverage our 5G network to execute our exciting growth initiatives and accelerate the merger integration. Let's start by talking about growth. We achieved our highest postpaid accounts and customer growth ever in 2021, which resulted in the best service revenue growth in company history and in the industry. We delivered strong ARPA and ARPU trends throughout 2021 with postpaid ARPA up nearly 2% from a year ago, consistent with our accounts and ARPA growth strategy we have shared with you. This postpaid ARPA growth is driven by both customer growth across both postpaid phones, including the success of our Magenta MAX offering and value-accretive postpaid other connections. We realized approximately $3.8 billion in synergies in 2021, nearly tripling year-over-year, with around $2.8 billion in P&L savings, which funded our growth initiatives and network build and roughly $1 billion in avoided costs. Through our higher service revenues and merger synergies, we reached record high core adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our recently raised guidance. Our growth in synergies have also unlocked rapid free cash flow expansion, which nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.6 billion in 2021 and it's just the beginning of our unique journey to deliver significant shareholder value. So, let's talk about how our great execution and investments in 2021 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2022. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue the accelerated Sprint customer migration. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones and continued growth in high-speed Internet. This net adds guidance does not include an expected small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint network, which will be treated as a base adjustment at the end of Q1 for CDMA and the end of Q2 for LTE. The anticipated small impact of these adjustments is fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. So, we expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $25.6 billion and $26.1 billion, up approximately 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies. And this excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to $5 billion to $5.3 billion in 2022, primarily as we unlock more network savings, particularly as we get into the second half of the year. Merger-related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. These costs will peak this year as we laid out at Analyst Day, and we expect roughly one-third of the total to occur in Q1 and another third in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs is expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year. We expect cash CapEx to be between $13 billion and $13.5 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration while also accelerating additional components of our build plan in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer experience. It is important to reiterate that our overall network capital budget remains unchanged. This acceleration further strengthens our competitive advantage by continuing the unprecedented pace of deployment, which unlocks the differentiated growth and significant cash flow generation potential of this business. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26% as 2021 included significant onetime benefits. And finally, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up again in 2022 as we execute on our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships. As Mike mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in 2022, driven by continued customer adoption of Magenta MAX. Altogether, we expect 2022 to be a year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. Our unique opportunity to unlock significant expansion in free cash flow is what we find so exciting and look forward to building on our momentum this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jud Henry for Q&A. Jud?\nJud Henry: All right. Thanks, Peter. Let\u2019s get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with the question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to our first question at this time from Phil Cusick of J.P. Morgan.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Phil.\nOperator: And one moment, please. Please go ahead, sir. Please go ahead, sir.\nPhil Cusick: Detail on the space adjustment at the end of the...\nMike Sievert: Hey, Phil, we lost you at the beginning. Can you start over?\nPhil Cusick: Sorry.\nMike Sievert: Yeah.\nPhil Cusick: Let me start over. So, thanks to the direction on postpaid phones being half of adds. What do you \u2013 can you give us more detail on how you think of this base adjustment at the end of the transition? Do you expect that these are sort of non-responsive customers that you\u2019ll treat it as an adjustment rather than people who actually leave? And how else do you think about fixed wireless broadband for 2022 within that guide? Thank you.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes.\nMike Sievert: Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Phil. So yes, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to continue on this journey and get the CDMA network shutdown and transition that technology and really unlock things for customers, particularly with 5G. In terms of what we expect there, what we\u2019re anticipating is probably in order of a couple hundred thousand phone subscribers. And really what those represent is the non-usage subscribers that we\u2019ve seen really tail off. So, it\u2019s not customers really leaving. I think it\u2019s really the tale of non-usage customers there. And of course, we\u2019ll probably see some other devices. It\u2019s a little unique. You have some end-of-life devices that really aren\u2019t practical to be replaced. So that\u2019s really there. But again, couldn\u2019t be more excited about the progress that we\u2019re making towards decommissioning these networks and both unlocking the synergies that come from that, but also putting all of that spectrum to use in the 5G space. And all of that is incorporated in the guidance that we gave you. With respect to fixed wireless, what we really see is 2022 will be a bigger year than 2021. And that\u2019s how we thought about it in the context of the guide that we gave you, but not specific figures.\nMike Sievert: And maybe Dow, you can give a little color on how it\u2019s going out there with mobile Internet and what we\u2019re seeing and why is 2022 going to be a bigger year?\nDow Draper: Yes. As we said earlier, I mean, this last year was our launch \u2013 our official launch \u2013 we did 542 \u2013 or ended the year with just under 650,000 customers. So, it\u2019s a great growth year for us. And the thing that\u2019s really exciting about this business is customer satisfaction continues to actually improve. I mean we\u2019re already three times higher than cable, and we\u2019re seeing it improve. So, the customers are liking it. We have momentum. The other exciting piece about this is that 40% of the customers we\u2019re bringing on are new to T-Mobile, which is a fantastic opportunity for us to cross-sell our wireless services. So, this continues to be the case. And our economics, as we stated back at Analyst Day, continue to be something that\u2019s really great and attractive postpaid like ARPU, much lower acquisition costs. So economically, this is a really good piece for us. So, we\u2019re seeing all the things that we had expected continue to trend as we expected even more favorably than we expected. And the penetration we\u2019re seeing across different market types also continues to be really positive. I mean the majority of our customers are coming from suburban and urban areas. And don\u2019t get me wrong, we do very well in rural areas where people are looking for even one choice of high-speed Internet. So that\u2019s been great. But the value proposition that we have, the simplicity, the price, the quality of the product, the fact that we have back it with amazing customer service, it\u2019s so easy to set up, all these are resonating with customers, whether they come from cable, which is still the majority of customers that we\u2019re bringing on or customers that are just looking for a great Internet provider. So, all these things give us great momentum in the fourth quarter, again, where we were number one in industry net adds, and we continue to \u2013 we expect to lean into that going into 2022.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Last word on home Internet, Phil. I would say \u2013 I think some people are going to be surprised. I mentioned this in my remarks at how mainstream this product really is. And you certainly saw it in our growth numbers in Q4 where we beat the industry. But more importantly, you see it in our usage profiles. Average users are using 300 to 400 gigs a month. We have a mid-single digit using more than a terabyte. And people might say, well, that\u2019s not the same as cable. Cable uses more than that. But if you look at the broad distribution of cable users, their medians are right in that range. Their averages are only higher because they have some 10%, 20% of people that use multiple terabytes. Look, we can support some of that, too, as we\u2019re demonstrating today. But we don\u2019t have to target those people. I mean 80%, 90% of the customers are right in the sweet spot of where our product performs. And that\u2019s a wide, huge TAM for us. This is a very mainstream product for one reason. Our 5G is backed by the massive capacity of our rollout advancements and our spectrum portfolio. Nobody else is anywhere close or we\u2019ll give you quite some time. Yes, please, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Mike, just a follow-up on one thing. I think that Peter said \u2013 and thanks on the fixed wireless side. That couple of hundred thousand customers, you said mostly non-usage. Is it fair to assume that the revenue associated with those are substantially less than average for those customers?\nMike Sievert: Yes. And it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have it exactly sized yet, and its low usage and no usage and lower revenue. But it\u2019s basically the people who you\u2019ve offered them a phone completely brand-new, totally free phone several times, and they haven\u2019t responded. And in many cases, they have lower revenue profiles, little or no usage. And we don\u2019t have it perfectly sized yet. But it\u2019s \u2013 what Peter is trying to get at is it\u2019s not material to either our total subscriber enrollment nor our revenues. And so, at some point, when we begin our orderly transition, which looks like it\u2019s right on track for March 31, we\u2019ll begin that orderly shutdown of CDMA we\u2019ll do a residual base adjustment, but it won\u2019t have a material impact on our financials. And certainly, whatever impact we do expect is fully embedded in the guidance we shared with you today.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks very much, guys.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Okay. Operator?\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019re going to be moving next to our question from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question and great to hear the confidence you have in the cash flow profile of the company. Going back, that\u2019s one of the principal reasons why you had expressed confidence that you would be getting to a point where you could seek approval from the Board to pursue a fairly meaningful buyback program. Could you maybe just revisit for us what are some of the conditions you would hope that the business would be in, in order to be in a position to go seek that approval? And to what extent would that be operational milestones like completing certain elements of the integration, such as the network integration versus maybe being in line with certain financial objectives, such as where you\u2019re looking to get leverage? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Of course. I\u2019ll just take you back to Analyst Day because essentially nothing\u2019s changed. We\u2019re a year smarter, but all that year has done is demonstrate that the thesis we shared with you last year is completely intact, if not better than before. And what we said back then is that it\u2019s all predicated on the massive cash flow potential of this business, particularly in the years 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. So, we set an aspiration of about a $60 billion program during those years, the possibility of starting sooner, and all of that remains intact because the thesis is intact. And you saw that we authorized a pretty good capital build for this year because we\u2019re running well ahead of schedule on integration. We want to get this thing behind us. That means next year\u2019s capital profile will be lower. We\u2019re going to see a significant step down in capital next year versus this year. We don\u2019t have any formal updates for you, but the entire thesis that that magnitude of buyback makes sense and is a great way to return value in those time frames, including the possibility of starting earlier, all of that\u2019s intact. But I can\u2019t really parse it for you any more than that in terms of our deliberations. So sorry about that.\nBrett Feldman: Well, as a follow-up for Pete. You had previously expressed the goal of getting to investment grade. I don\u2019t think that was a prerequisite for pursuing buybacks, but obviously, the rate environment has changed since I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re thinking around your balance sheet priorities have evolved at all. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: No. They haven\u2019t. And look, it\u2019s very straightforward. We are going to achieve in this time frame according to our outlooks investment grade. We are going to \u2013 according to our outlooks have the wherewithal to be able to do these buybacks. They\u2019re not in tension with one another. And there are no preset predicates to when we might pursue these things. But I don\u2019t have a formal update for you.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: And so, we\u2019ll move to our next question from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thanks. So, let\u2019s stay with \u2013 you talked a lot about fixed wireless broadband. Let\u2019s stay with the cable theme for a second. Having now seen the rapid growth that the cable operators posted in their wireless businesses. Can you talk about how you think about coexisting with cable? I\u2019m guessing they probably don\u2019t take a lot of subscribers directly from you, but they now sort of occupy a similar kind of value price that you occupy. How much do you think that affects your growth trajectory?\nMike Sievert: Well, as you know, Craig, we also posted the biggest postpaid numbers in the entire industry in that same quarter you\u2019re asking about, Q4, the one we\u2019re reporting. And the highest postpaid net adds in our history in the full year 2021, all during which we\u2019re seeing this trend on cable, which isn\u2019t new. Cable had a strong quarter in Q4, but it wasn\u2019t an outsized quarter. I mean basically, it was 10.4% of gross adds. And we\u2019ve been saying for a long time, we see them right around 10%. They\u2019ve been consistent performers. And when you have those kinds of smaller bases that you\u2019ll see a little bit more variability in nets. But their activations are very consistent. And you see how we\u2019re thriving in that environment. And one of the issues is what you talked about. We think our value proposition is distinct, and it\u2019s resonating. And I\u2019m really talking about the Magenta value proposition because that\u2019s the one we bring to the market. We talked about the fact that if Magenta churn matched Sprint churn, and they were both at the Magenta levels right now, which is certainly a long-term trend, this performance this last quarter would have been 1.4 million postpaid phone net adds, the highest in our history. And it\u2019s not meant to give you some alternate reality on Q4. It\u2019s meant to express what we see in the underlying trends of our business that don\u2019t always come through in the reports. So, look, we are coexisting with them. We\u2019ve been coexisting with them and we\u2019re really just not concerned about some step change catalyst. Great. Operator, let\u2019s go back.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to a question from Michael Rollins of Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. And good afternoon. Hi. I wanted to touch upon the flow of performance over the course of 2022. I think you mentioned earlier that the integration investments would be, I think, one-third, one-third and then the balance in the back half of the year. I\u2019m just curious how we should be thinking about the pace of churn \u2013 normal course churn or Sprint related churn over the course of the year as you\u2019re continuing with the integration, how to think about the synergy realization and whether EBITDA growth is back-end loaded for the timing of those savings and then as it relates to free cash flow.\nMike Sievert: Sure. Let me make a comment on churn, and then I\u2019ll hand it to Peter on what you can expect in terms of timing, so he can give you his usual non-answer on how it will all unfold during the year. But look, on churn, what I mentioned in my remarks is that we\u2019re, as expected, seeing a seasonal step down in churn. But we\u2019re also seeing an improvement in our relative performance with our underlying Magenta porting better so far in Q1 than in Q4, where it was already very strong. So, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019re seeing. And then underneath that, I mentioned that I believe that Q4 would be the high watermark quarter for churn overall, certainly through this multiyear integration period. And the reason why we were able to express some confidence in that is that you remember last time, I said there had been a small group of people that have sort of fully completed the migration. And we weren\u2019t sure if there was a selection bias or what was going on, but they looked exactly like or even a little better than Magenta. And now we have a significant cohort, millions that have moved across. It\u2019s still a minority. I mean, it\u2019s going to take some time because it\u2019s driven by upgrades, which are stepwise. But now we have a big material cohort of people who have a compatible device. They have one or more on their account T-Mobile payment plans or T-Mobile light payment plans, not the leasing, on a compatible device, domiciled on the T-Mobile network. And when you have those pieces in place, there are lots of pieces. But when you have those pieces in place, you see churn just like Magenta. And we have now a significant minority of Sprint customers that have that in place. And it makes sense. If you have one or more phones on your band that have to be every single one \u2013 a band is an account. If you have one or more phones that are on a new T-Mobile like payment plan, then you see how user-friendly it is versus the leases. You see how it performs on the network versus your prior product. And there\u2019s a dynamic there of having a level of commitment to the company. And so, you see that taste of Magenta and what it\u2019s like, and that corresponds to churn just like Magenta. So now we\u2019re able to say, look, we just got to get the job done. We have to sweep across all these bands, make sure that they have the experience of agenda, particularly compatible phones and compatible phone plans, and we\u2019re going to see the performance that we expect. And it\u2019s easier to predict now that we have a material cohort that\u2019s come all the way across. As to the time frames on some of the financials through the quarter, what kind of color can you share, Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. I\u2019ll try to give more than a non-answer to say, Mike. But you mentioned, Mike, on the merger-related costs, and we said out of the guide that we provided, we anticipate about a third of that in Q1 and about a third of that in Q2. And you see that, of course, as you starting to decommission the cell sites, you\u2019re going to start seeing the majority of this cost be associated with that e-com. By the way, and all of this acceleration of synergy that we provided, including beating 2021 and this 2022 guide, we\u2019re still projecting the same total amount of merger-related costs, which remember, were $15 billion. I do think now instead of the 11.5 OpEx, 3.5 CapEx, what we\u2019ll see is about 12 OpEx and 3 CapEx because the acceleration actually meant some things that we thought would be capitalized and now flipped to OpEx given the shorter time frame. So that\u2019s it with respect to merger-related costs. And those perceive the synergies. So, as I said, as you start decoming the cell sites, in particular, you\u2019re going to start seeing the network synergies build in the second half of the year. And those are the things that will give you color around how it develops with respect to core EBITDA. And of course, you have other things such as seasonality and holiday and gross add flows that will affect some of that, but at least color around merger-related cost and synergy developments throughout the course of the year.\nMichael Rollins: Okay. Sounds good. Let\u2019s go to Twitter for a couple and then come right back to the phone. So, Neville, Bill Ho asks, with Auction 110 spectrum expanding our mid-band TDD, what are the issues beyond clearing to put this new spectrum into service? And while you\u2019re at it, with 5G ultra capacity, 260 million POPs targeted by the end of this year and 300 at the end of next year, is that organic or with roaming partners or what should we expect them?\nNeville Ray: Great. Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the cue, Bill. So, Action 110, so we\u2019re very pleased with the outcome, as Mike referenced in his opening comments, a great addition for us to our mid-band spectrum position. Your question there about what are the issues, well, obviously, this is a new band. So \u2013 and it does have some complexity with coordination with the DoD to navigate. So that takes a little bit of time. The radio infrastructure is new. So that has to be brought on and made available. And obviously, supply chain can play in there. And then third, but certainly not the last issue, is handsets and devices. And so, we see kind of from the major OEMs availability on devices in this band tail end of this year, early next. So, for T-Mobile, our plan is to look at starting deployment of that 110 spectrum in 2023 in conjunction with the C-band spectrum that we purchased last year. And that\u2019s a one and done for us. That\u2019s a single radio. Unlike the AT&T approach you\u2019ve heard about, which is two radios kind of integrated together. So, for us, I mean, we\u2019re looking to deploy the spectrum at the perfect time as we move into 2023. So very pleased with the outcome there. And I think the other important piece, as Mike referenced, we purchased spectrum in key areas of the country where the spectrum is most suited for deployment and capacity use. On the target for 260 million POPs by the end of 2022 and then 300 million by the end of 2023, nobody more excited about those numbers than me. That\u2019s one hell of a footprint and looks to really extend the powerful lead we have today. And are we going to be using roaming partners? I think they\u2019re going to be very few and far between. I think the question out there, Bill, is how many folks are going to be coming to T-Mobile and asking if they can roam on our great 5G with all of that footprint and capacity and capability that\u2019s out there. So, it\u2019s an organic build. I won\u2019t say 100%, but effectively, it\u2019s a T-Mobile build, so excited on both those.\nJud Henry: Okay. Back to the phones in a minute. But first, Roger Entner, Mike Katz, he asked, can you talk about progress in the business segment, both for phone and for fixed wireless. So, a little color on the quarter and maybe what you see ahead in 2022?\nMike Katz: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Roger. And look, I\u2019m very, very proud of the progress that we made in business this last year. As you heard Mike talked about at the beginning of the call, we left 2021 in with a win rate and a corresponding net add velocity, that gets us to the 20% target share target that we talked about at Analyst Day in 2025. So, I\u2019m really thrilled with the momentum that we\u2019re building there. And we left the year with a lot of momentum. Last time we were here together, I talked about it being the best quarter that we\u2019ve had in enterprise. Q4 bested Q3 in enterprise. So, we\u2019ve left 2021 with a lot of momentum. And one of the things that we\u2019re seeing is the size of the wins that we\u2019re getting. It\u2019s not just new companies picking us, but it\u2019s the depth of wins. And it\u2019s really well demonstrated by one of the ones we announced this last quarter with Alaska Airlines picking us to not just be a partner but be their primary wireless provider. And those are the kinds of partnerships that we see striking, both in enterprise and government throughout the course of 2021. The wins are coming both in phone, but also in postpaid other, the latter of which we\u2019re really excited about, because we are seeing CLVs on other connectivity that are greater than phone in enterprise and governance. So, it\u2019s really profitable business for us. And in that part of the business, we led the industry in growth there. So, it\u2019s coming both simultaneously from phone and postpaid other. On fixed wireless, Dow will tell you that part of the growth that we had this year certainly came from business customers, and I see that as one of the big growth vectors for us this coming year. Certainly, in small business where they \u2013 we talk about the lack of choices that consumers have in fixed wireless. Just think about how rough it is for small businesses. Man, they get gouged. They have very few choices and the choices they have, they really get gouged. So, we think there\u2019s a big growth opportunity in small business. And we think there\u2019s opportunities across other business segments as well, including large enterprise, where we can provide both primary and redundant service in certain use cases. So, Dow and I worked closely on that, and I see that as one of our big growth opportunities as we roll into 2022.\nJud Henry: Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Okay, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Chaplin of New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two quick ones, one for Peter. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context for what you\u2019re assuming in your net add guidance for the industry. Is it another year of 9 million adds to the industry? Are we heading back towards a sort of a pre-pandemic trend of maybe 5.5, 6? And then maybe for Mike, sticking with the fixed wireless broadband theme, I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on the pricing environment in broadband and a sense for other markets where you\u2019re up against Verizon\u2019s fixed wireless broadband product. And if so, how does your message around 5G resonate against their $30 pricing?\nMike Sievert: Terrific. Okay. First to Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. And look, Jonathan, I think the important thing is, at some point, this industry will probably normalize more to pre-pandemic levels, right? That\u2019s no doubt about it that it will happen at some point. It might come in ebbs and flows. The most important thing is in what we provided you from a net add guidance and what we, of course, delivered in 2021 that you have to ask yourself is, who really has a clearly articulated strategy backed up with proof points in terms of how they\u2019re going to generate the growth. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about the guide that we gave you because of all the underpenetrated opportunities that we have, smaller markets and rural areas, you just heard Mike Katz talk about enterprise and government, of course, what we have in terms of high-speed Internet, and we\u2019re going into all of these areas while we\u2019re building a completely differentiated network that is going to stay ahead. And that's going to fuel the opportunity to bring the best product and the best value, fuel the growth that we're seeing and the momentum and the stats that you've heard, whether it's from smaller markets and rural areas that are generating the account growth. We're just tremendously excited about it. And so, despite what the industry does in 2022, we feel very confident in the guide that we gave because of, again, the product differentiation on the network and our ability and traction and growth opportunities in these underrepresented areas.\nMike Sievert: Yes. And on mobile broadband or fixed wireless, no, we're not really running into that. But remember, we're just operating at a different scale. So, in Q4, we delivered more net adds than Verizon has delivered in the entire time frame they've been swinging the bat on fixed wireless, three-years plus. So, we're operating at completely different scales. And you have to remember that while they're starting with mid-band 5G, they're starting with very small amount of geographic coverage and concentrating POPs in urban areas where it's easiest to do deploy. We started planning our mid-band 5G in 2018 with permitting and licensing and started rolling it out in earnest over two-years ago so \u2013 or about two years ago. So, we know that's a different opportunity. So, we're not really running into that much. As to their pricing, it's interesting what to see, where that goes. I\u2019ll tell you this, the response we're getting to our offers is phenomenal, the idea being able to have a product with massive capacity and mainstream usage, across vast class of this country for $50.0 including all taxes and fees, and no promotional like our wired into fine Verizon offers. That\u2019s really cool and that\u2019s resonating and we\u2019re not really not out to respond to other people\u2019s initiative, we\u2019re out the like customers with an offer with product. The think I think they will see is that it\u2019s backed by this massive capacity network, others \u2013 it just kind of shows a time-to-market advantage. Others do have massive capacity in a few places with millimeter wave, but they're also demonstrated issues there with self-install and other complications. And so, we feel like we've got the right sweet spot and we're just heads down executing our strategy and really not worrying about all the noise.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We'll move next to Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about some of the key priorities for the CapEx program. I think we were a little bit surprised last month when the guide \u2013 or in December when the guide went up year-over-year given that you've achieved the $210 million already, so any color around that? And also, color around the dispute with the FAA around the C-band availability and maybe also pivoting to Mike, does that give you an opportunity to do more with enterprises that rely on connectivity around airports. How and when do you think this issue will be resolved? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: You do capital, I'll do the FAA.\nNeville Ray: Sure. Yes. We'll split the two. Yes. Thanks, Simon. So obviously, this is a year with this powerful lead that we just talked about, we really want to press that home in 2022. And Mike referenced earlier, how this is our time. We've built a very, very high-performing deployment machine. It's not just deployment, its supply chain logistics, radio features, there's so much to pulling together this type of deployment at this pace, which is record breaking. So, while we have that wind in our sales, it's a great opportunity for us to really push the envelope and gap our competition. For Verizon to come close to what we're delivering, it's a multiyear task. And AT&T with their announced strategy have really said meaningful for our 5G customer \u2013 meaningful experience for our 5G customers, it kind of may start in 2023, maybe. So, they've almost put another year on the clock for themselves. So, they're also way behind. So, it's a perfect opportunity where we have such a high-performing machine. There's a bunch of other pieces in there, Simon. Obviously, we continue to expand and increase our coverage. We're working hard on in building and supporting Mike and the team on the TFB side. That's another area of growth for us. And we want to wrap up on this integration. Part of that program is upgrading a high volume of Sprint sites that we always said we would integrate and combine into the T-Mobile network, adding coverage and capacity. And part of the pull forward is to get all of that work done inside the 2022 envelope as well. So, lots of things ongoing, but we have incredible momentum. We have the crews, the equipment, the team, the process. And so, this is a great year for us to really look to extend that leadership we've now established.\nMike Sievert: Simon, just to double down on what Neville said. Neville's plan respects and understands that there's a lot more to a customer's network assessment than just our massive 5G lead. They also want coverage everywhere it matters to them. And we have such a great coverage footprint, but we've always talked about in our merger plan the idea of 10,000 incremental sites going after smaller markets and rural areas and pursuing great business opportunities for us in underpenetrated segments. And our thought is, let's get after that now and get it done. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the capital, but you don't see a different goal on the POP coverage other than around the margins on 5G because a big part of this is about chasing meaningful coverage for consumers and, as Neville said, for businesses. And we think that's very important to our overall competitive story. As it relates to the controversy, we see AT&T and Verizon embroiled in, first of all, it would be awfully tempting to sit on the outside of a controversy like that and take pot shots. But honestly, we think that in the final analysis after the work has been done, the studies have been completed, we think the wireless industry, AT&T, Verizon, the FCC positions will be validated. And we think they're right. So, these are different frequencies than what radio altimeters operate in. And a properly functioning radio altimeter, I think, will ultimately be shown not to be interfered with by C-band. I regret that this has been so widely reported as a 5G issue and that we've been a little left out of the story there. It would be great if what sold clicks for the press was to say, and by the way, T-Mobile is already nationwide with a frequency that has nothing to do with this controversy. But that doesn't really sell page views, and so it's not showing up in a lot of the reports. But as I said, when this \u2013 when everything is said and done and the assessments are completed this year and people take a breath because of the importance of this issue, I think the positions of AT&T, Verizon and the FCC will be validated. And that's our company's view. Obviously, we've taken interest in this because we hope to deploy C-band down the road. We're not in a rush. But to me, that's very important. And if it's ultimately found that some old or faulty radio altimeters are picking up stray signals, then I'm sure that the country will deal with that. I for one would prefer to have a world where there aren't old and faulty radio altimeters out there. So, look, we'll see how it all unfolds. But I think the positions of the industry and the FCC will ultimately be validated.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And we'll go next to a question from John Hodulik of UBS.\nMike Sievert: Hi, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Hi, Mike. A couple of questions, first on fixed wireless. Do you guys have a sense of where those customers are coming from? I mean, whether it's cable or maybe start fixed services or customers move the category? And then in terms of the ramp, I mean, at what point \u2013 how long does it take to get to sort of the run rate in net adds where you think you're sort of going full speed now the logistics worked out and then the business model sort of clicking? And then my quick question, a follow-up to the buyback, I think that obviously is a big focus of investors. Is there any chance that you could see the buyback, given the potential magnitude of this over the next few years, starting in the second half of the year, given it really looks like, as really Peter called out, you'll be really largely through or really starting to see the sort of the end of the integration at that point? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. Well, Dow, let's go back to you on some of these statistics on urban and suburban or on cable switchers, new to T-Mobile and what you're seeing also the ramp rate for this year next.\nDow Draper: Yes. So, I mean, the great thing about our position here and what Neville and his team have built is we're all across the country in all different markets, all different types of markets. So \u2013 and we're seeing wins \u2013 customer wins across all of those. So, we're certainly seeing a small percentage of people who have never had wireless before coming to us. And we certainly do very well. And as you would imagine, in rural and small-town America where they have either no or a choice and that choice isn't very good, and so we're doing well there. The thing that's been also validating for us is that we are also winning well in urban and suburban markets. In fact, the majority of our customers come from suburban and urban markets, and the majority of those are coming from cable and fiber and other things. I know you might say, well, why is that? And look, quite frankly, we're half the price in a lot of cases against cable companies when you add in their fees and all the different charges they have. Also, it's simplistic. We don't have price hikes. I mean, customers are generally very unhappy with the cable industry. So that tends to be why we see people coming to us from all different types of geographies, all different providers, especially cable and fiber, is it's just a better value proposition. They get treated right and it's a good product. And in terms of the trajectory, remember, we are really following the network build. And so, as you're seeing, Neville is covering the country in terms of coverage. We're adding capacity, and that capacity just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger over the next several years. And so, I think our business will continue to grow and scale along with that build, at least that's our plan as more availability, more capacity and supportability arise.\nMike Sievert: Great. And then on the share buyback, I think what you're getting at, is there a preconceived milestone? And no, there's no particular preconceived milestone that we're looking for. And beyond that, I can't really update you on our deliberations and our Board's deliberations other than to repeat what I said a minute ago, which is that when we put out this thesis a year ago, we saw a future that of rapidly accelerating cash flow, massive value creation opportunity and the wherewithal to do $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 with the possibility of starting sooner. And everything we saw then is still intact and obviously, many of the underlying trends, as you saw with our great cash flow beat this year, if anything, are improving.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thanks guys.\nMike Sievert: Operator, let\u2019s go back to the next caller.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go to our next caller, Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Well, thanks so much. Sorry to follow-up on broadband, but I'm just curious if you're able to offer any context on business versus residential, but also relative to the follow \u2013 the build-out of the network, is there any reason why the fourth quarter isn't the right growth pace to look at for fixed wireless net adds in 1Q and beyond? That would be interesting. And then separately, just your comment on premiums like Netflix and Apple TV+ and Paramount+, how have those impacted marketing? Would you look to add more services? Has that been efficient for you? That would be helpful.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Well, first of all, as it relates to the trends that Dow was saying, we see 2022 significantly bigger than 2021, and we see 2023 bigger than 2022. So, we do see a ramp-up happening. We probably fixed wireless is such a new industry, and we're by far the leaders in the U.S. I don't think there's a seasonality trend well established yet for this part of the industry. And so, look, we're going into places informed by our capital and our network capacity and where we're able to market. And there's so much great opportunity in smaller markets and rural areas, which I think we should talk about, both for mobile and for fixed. So, it's going to be a year of, I think, increasing momentum as essentially, we follow that network build. You remember in 2021, including Q4 with this record performance. We're still in the process of allocating capacity to the Destination Network. We're still in the height of an integration, and that capacity starts to massively increase and that opens up more and more doors for us because all of our opportunity in fixed wireless is centered around our excess capacity model being able to offer fixed wireless services in places where our analysis says mobile capacity won't take it up. As it relates to the second piece on marketing, I'll ask Jon Freier to comment on what he's seeing. And a big piece of this, Jon, is as consumers are trying to get to know us in smaller markets and rural areas and our brand differentiation with the Un-carrier, things like Netflix on us, Apple TV+ for a year, all of the things that we provide, some of which we're talking about in this question, what are people in smaller markets and rural areas nationwide seeing as it relates to our value proposition.\nJon Freier: Yes. So, thank you for the question. I got to tell you, we are just incredibly excited about what's happening with this space. Like Mike said, we pioneered this entire space of having content that people love and get into the very best value with Netflix On Us that we introduced back in 2017 and then followed up with YouTube TV and a discount on YouTube TV and Filo and Apple TV+ on us for a period of 12 months on us and then also with what we announced in Q4 on Paramount+ on us for 12 months as well. So, all of that is going incredibly well because it is the very best content that you can get that is at \u2013 is brought to you at the very best value. And so, when you look at all of that put together, we love how that's working. And like Mike said, in the smaller markets in rural area space, people are just loving that because you got to remember, these people \u2013 and just let me just back up 140 million people, 50 million households, 40% of the entire country have been looking at these T-Mobile television commercials for years and years and years and see what the Un-carrier is doing and wishing they could have some of that. And now what we're being able to do is bring them that, that incredible value, that incredible offer set that they haven't been able to get before. And what Neville was talking about a little while ago with this network pull forward, it's given us a huge opportunity to go after this space. I'm really proud with what we've done so far in 2021, 13% market share increased to 15% market share. That's fantastic. But we really see a much bigger opportunity in front of us because when you think about the markets that we have a permission to win in, we've taken all of our markets and kind of dice them up into 770 pipe markets across the country. And when you \u2013 and we're looking at them from a full network superiority position all the way to \u2013 we need to make some investment and there's a few a few steps along the way. But when you look at the markets where we have a permission to win across the 775 markets and smaller markets and rural areas, it's about a third. It's about a third. So, we're moving this market share position of 13% to 15% by playing really only about a third of the markets in smaller markets and rural areas. And that's why this coverage expansion is so incredibly important so as we can continue to get more and more markets with the permission to win, and we can follow that with our infamous sales and marketing playbook that the Un-carrier is famous for, we see huge opportunities here. And just remember, these are places that from a wireless perspective, it's really kind of a page of the 1990s with really kind of two choices, and it's like high cost and higher costs. Those are the two choices that are in those particular areas. So, with us bringing our value proposition and a superior 5G network declaration in these markets, we think we have a huge opportunity to continue to bring this winning formula across the entire country.\nDoug Mitchelson: Helpful. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Well then great. Let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: And we'll go to our next question from David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess just one quick numbers question, guys. Obviously, last year with the DISH announcement with the relationship with AT&T, the closing of the Verizon TracPhone announcement, high-margin wholesale revenue is kind of this unknown quantity as we look into 2022. Could you kind of share with us \u2013 you said in the past you expected this trajectory to go to zero over time? But can you kind of give us more color as to kind of how you think this is going to unfold into 2022? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sure. In that particular question, I think you were talking about DISH because we sure don't see wholesale going to zero but that's always been our plan with DISH is that ultimately, they would build their own network and wouldn't need ours. And as you know, the AT&T deal that they struck last year looked to us like it would accelerate that. And that's fully embedded in our guidance. So, I think we've previously disclosed that in 2021, our revenues from DISH were under $2 billion. The guidance we gave you today assumes that in 2022, it's a lot less than that, material step down in 2022. And \u2013 but at the same time, that means there's a materially less usage of our network from DISH, and that opens up other opportunities. First of all, in wholesale, we recently struck a deal to make sure we have a thoughtful transition with TracFone over multiple years, and that's something I think is very productive for both us and for Verizon. We have been able to strike a multiyear exclusive agreement with Google for the Google Offer, and that's very exciting. And we're in discussions with several other opportunities, both renewals and greenfield. So, and that's just in the wholesale area. The other opportunity, of course as these millions of customers come off our network is increased capacity for us to pursue our core business. And our core business is on fire. If there's nothing else, we've gotten across on this call, including the fixed wireless that's subject of so much interest today because that's a consumptive product, and it's all driven on a detailed excess capacity model. So as capacity frees up, that frees up new eligible households. So, lots of opportunity, but I wanted to be clear on at least what the guidance that Peter shared with you today assumed. And hopefully, that helps.\nDavid Barden: Thanks guys.\nJud Henry: Alright, we got time for one final question.\nMike Sievert: Wow. Is it that time already? Okay. Great. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go to that last question from Peter Supino of Bernstein.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Supino: Hi, thank you. So, time flies when you're having fun, right? I just wanted to ask a very long-term oriented questions, so please expand your aperture out many years. T-Mobile has about 27 million accounts. The market is trending towards \u2013 albeit just recently \u2013 towards a more bundled relationship with consumers in your fixed wireless broadband initiative looks extremely timely in that context. But one question we get often from investors is, how does T-Mobile thrive over the long run? How does T-Mobile keep a valuation multiple when it has a finite ability to sell fixed wireless in a converging marketplace? And I'd love to know your thoughts on that. Is that \u2013 does that get solved by densification, by ad spectrum? What's the long-term plan for that?\nMike Sievert: Yes. It's a great question. Well, first of all, I would say that the question presumes some things about convergence, which I don't know how they will apply in the United States. One broad trend, if we're going macro, that we certainly keep in mind is the underlying health and vitality of mobile. The broad trends are that all content and communications of all kinds are leaving and have left their prior linear forms and landing on the Internet, and eyeball time and usage and customers on the Internet are going mobile. So, the broad trend is from linear to Internet to mobile. And we're the country's leading pure-play mobile Internet Company, and that is a great place to be. And we're backed by a differentiated asset base that really does have the ability to deliver massive capacity. We don't talk much about our second best in the industry millimeter wave portfolio, the years' long lead we have deploying spectrum against our mid-band leadership portfolio. And all of this builds to a position of massive potential capacity that we can use to create businesses. And those businesses may be pure connectivity or they may be things that surround connectivity as we're already starting to see in the enterprise space. In my remarks earlier, I said that we're entering actual revenue agreements for advanced 5G services with major organizations, including the Federal Government itself, not trials, but major agreements. And so, there's lots of opportunity when you have a differentiated asset base, a strong balance sheet, a killer brand, a creative, fast and entrepreneurial team and the wherewithal to be able to turn those things into businesses. What I can tell you is that we thought it through at a level deeper than that for the five- or six-year picture. And we see the trends that we've been describing to you pretty clearly within that time frame. And it gives us a lot of confidence in the massive shareholder value creation that we see ahead. I hope that helps.\nPeter Supino: Thanks so much.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great, Peter. Well, Jud, anything \u2013 any final words?\nJud Henry: No, I just appreciate everybody joining us today. Obviously, we look forward to speaking with you again soon and telling you more of this exciting journey in 2022. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team or the media relations team. And again, we look forward to speaking again soon. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Bye, everybody.\nOperator: And so, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Investor Relations Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Again, if you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media department. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Mike Katz",
            "content": "Yes. No, thanks for the question, Roger. And look, I'm very, very proud of the progress that we made in business this last year. As you heard Mike talked about at the beginning of the call, we left 2021 in with a win rate and a corresponding net add velocity, that gets us to the 20% target share target that we talked about at Analyst Day in 2025. So, I'm really thrilled with the momentum that we're building there. And we left the year with a lot of momentum. Last time we were here together, I talked about it being the best quarter that we've had in enterprise. Q4 bested Q3 in enterprise. So, we've left 2021 with a lot of momentum. And one of the things that we're seeing is the size of the wins that we're getting. It's not just new companies picking us, but it's the depth of wins. And it's really well demonstrated by one of the ones we announced this last quarter with Alaska Airlines picking us to not just be a partner but be their primary wireless provider. And those are the kinds of partnerships that we see striking, both in enterprise and government throughout the course of 2021. The wins are coming both in phone, but also in postpaid other, the latter of which we're really excited about, because we are seeing CLVs on other connectivity that are greater than phone in enterprise and governance. So, it's really profitable business for us. And in that part of the business, we led the industry in growth there. So, it's coming both simultaneously from phone and postpaid other. On fixed wireless, Dow will tell you that part of the growth that we had this year certainly came from business customers, and I see that as one of the big growth vectors for us this coming year. Certainly, in small business where they \u2013 we talk about the lack of choices that consumers have in fixed wireless. Just think about how rough it is for small businesses. Man, they get gouged. They have very few choices and the choices they have, they really get gouged. So, we think there's a big growth opportunity in small business. And we think there's opportunities across other business segments as well, including large enterprise, where we can provide both primary and redundant service in certain use cases. So, Dow and I worked closely on that, and I see that as one of our big growth opportunities as we roll into 2022."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our strong results in 2021 highlighted our unique ability to leverage our 5G network to execute our exciting growth initiatives and accelerate the merger integration. Let's start by talking about growth. We achieved our highest postpaid accounts and customer growth ever in 2021, which resulted in the best service revenue growth in company history and in the industry. We delivered strong ARPA and ARPU trends throughout 2021 with postpaid ARPA up nearly 2% from a year ago, consistent with our accounts and ARPA growth strategy we have shared with you. This postpaid ARPA growth is driven by both customer growth across both postpaid phones, including the success of our Magenta MAX offering and value-accretive postpaid other connections. We realized approximately $3.8 billion in synergies in 2021, nearly tripling year-over-year, with around $2.8 billion in P&L savings, which funded our growth initiatives and network build and roughly $1 billion in avoided costs. Through our higher service revenues and merger synergies, we reached record high core adjusted EBITDA of $23.6 billion, exceeding the high end of our recently raised guidance. Our growth in synergies have also unlocked rapid free cash flow expansion, which nearly doubled year-over-year to $5.6 billion in 2021 and it's just the beginning of our unique journey to deliver significant shareholder value. So, let's talk about how our great execution and investments in 2021 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2022. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue the accelerated Sprint customer migration. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones and continued growth in high-speed Internet. This net adds guidance does not include an expected small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint network, which will be treated as a base adjustment at the end of Q1 for CDMA and the end of Q2 for LTE. The anticipated small impact of these adjustments is fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. So, we expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $25.6 billion and $26.1 billion, up approximately 10% at the midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies. And this excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to $5 billion to $5.3 billion in 2022, primarily as we unlock more network savings, particularly as we get into the second half of the year. Merger-related costs not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. These costs will peak this year as we laid out at Analyst Day, and we expect roughly one-third of the total to occur in Q1 and another third in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs is expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year. We expect cash CapEx to be between $13 billion and $13.5 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration while also accelerating additional components of our build plan in order to capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer experience. It is important to reiterate that our overall network capital budget remains unchanged. This acceleration further strengthens our competitive advantage by continuing the unprecedented pace of deployment, which unlocks the differentiated growth and significant cash flow generation potential of this business. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.6 billion. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26% as 2021 included significant onetime benefits. And finally, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up again in 2022 as we execute on our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships. As Mike mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in 2022, driven by continued customer adoption of Magenta MAX. Altogether, we expect 2022 to be a year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. Our unique opportunity to unlock significant expansion in free cash flow is what we find so exciting and look forward to building on our momentum this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Jud Henry for Q&A. Jud? Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Phil. So yes, we couldn't be more excited to continue on this journey and get the CDMA network shutdown and transition that technology and really unlock things for customers, particularly with 5G. In terms of what we expect there, what we're anticipating is probably in order of a couple hundred thousand phone subscribers. And really what those represent is the non-usage subscribers that we've seen really tail off. So, it's not customers really leaving. I think it's really the tale of non-usage customers there. And of course, we'll probably see some other devices. It's a little unique. You have some end-of-life devices that really aren't practical to be replaced. So that's really there. But again, couldn't be more excited about the progress that we're making towards decommissioning these networks and both unlocking the synergies that come from that, but also putting all of that spectrum to use in the 5G space. And all of that is incorporated in the guidance that we gave you. With respect to fixed wireless, what we really see is 2022 will be a bigger year than 2021. And that's how we thought about it in the context of the guide that we gave you, but not specific figures. Yes, absolutely. I'll try to give more than a non-answer to say, Mike. But you mentioned, Mike, on the merger-related costs, and we said out of the guide that we provided, we anticipate about a third of that in Q1 and about a third of that in Q2. And you see that, of course, as you starting to decommission the cell sites, you're going to start seeing the majority of this cost be associated with that e-com. By the way, and all of this acceleration of synergy that we provided, including beating 2021 and this 2022 guide, we're still projecting the same total amount of merger-related costs, which remember, were $15 billion. I do think now instead of the 11.5 OpEx, 3.5 CapEx, what we'll see is about 12 OpEx and 3 CapEx because the acceleration actually meant some things that we thought would be capitalized and now flipped to OpEx given the shorter time frame. So that's it with respect to merger-related costs. And those perceive the synergies. So, as I said, as you start decoming the cell sites, in particular, you're going to start seeing the network synergies build in the second half of the year. And those are the things that will give you color around how it develops with respect to core EBITDA. And of course, you have other things such as seasonality and holiday and gross add flows that will affect some of that, but at least color around merger-related cost and synergy developments throughout the course of the year. Yes, absolutely. And look, Jonathan, I think the important thing is, at some point, this industry will probably normalize more to pre-pandemic levels, right? That's no doubt about it that it will happen at some point. It might come in ebbs and flows. The most important thing is in what we provided you from a net add guidance and what we, of course, delivered in 2021 that you have to ask yourself is, who really has a clearly articulated strategy backed up with proof points in terms of how they're going to generate the growth. And that's why we're so excited about the guide that we gave you because of all the underpenetrated opportunities that we have, smaller markets and rural areas, you just heard Mike Katz talk about enterprise and government, of course, what we have in terms of high-speed Internet, and we're going into all of these areas while we're building a completely differentiated network that is going to stay ahead. And that's going to fuel the opportunity to bring the best product and the best value, fuel the growth that we're seeing and the momentum and the stats that you've heard, whether it's from smaller markets and rural areas that are generating the account growth. We're just tremendously excited about it. And so, despite what the industry does in 2022, we feel very confident in the guide that we gave because of, again, the product differentiation on the network and our ability and traction and growth opportunities in these underrepresented areas."

            "content": "Yes. As we said earlier, I mean, this last year was our launch \u2013 our official launch \u2013 we did 542 \u2013 or ended the year with just under 650,000 customers. So, it's a great growth year for us. And the thing that's really exciting about this business is customer satisfaction continues to actually improve. I mean we're already three times higher than cable, and we're seeing it improve. So, the customers are liking it. We have momentum. The other exciting piece about this is that 40% of the customers we're bringing on are new to T-Mobile, which is a fantastic opportunity for us to cross-sell our wireless services. So, this continues to be the case. And our economics, as we stated back at Analyst Day, continue to be something that's really great and attractive postpaid like ARPU, much lower acquisition costs. So economically, this is a really good piece for us. So, we're seeing all the things that we had expected continue to trend as we expected even more favorably than we expected. And the penetration we're seeing across different market types also continues to be really positive. I mean the majority of our customers are coming from suburban and urban areas. And don't get me wrong, we do very well in rural areas where people are looking for even one choice of high-speed Internet. So that's been great. But the value proposition that we have, the simplicity, the price, the quality of the product, the fact that we have back it with amazing customer service, it's so easy to set up, all these are resonating with customers, whether they come from cable, which is still the majority of customers that we're bringing on or customers that are just looking for a great Internet provider. So, all these things give us great momentum in the fourth quarter, again, where we were number one in industry net adds, and we continue to \u2013 we expect to lean into that going into 2022. Yes. So, I mean, the great thing about our position here and what Neville and his team have built is we're all across the country in all different markets, all different types of markets. So \u2013 and we're seeing wins \u2013 customer wins across all of those. So, we're certainly seeing a small percentage of people who have never had wireless before coming to us. And we certainly do very well. And as you would imagine, in rural and small-town America where they have either no or a choice and that choice isn't very good, and so we're doing well there. The thing that's been also validating for us is that we are also winning well in urban and suburban markets. In fact, the majority of our customers come from suburban and urban markets, and the majority of those are coming from cable and fiber and other things. I know you might say, well, why is that? And look, quite frankly, we're half the price in a lot of cases against cable companies when you add in their fees and all the different charges they have. Also, it's simplistic. We don't have price hikes. I mean, customers are generally very unhappy with the cable industry.

They get treated right and it's a good product. And in terms of the trajectory, remember, we are really following the network build. And so, as you're seeing, Neville is covering the country in terms of coverage. We're adding capacity, and that capacity just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger over the next several years.

So, Action 110, so we're very pleased with the outcome, as Mike referenced in his opening comments, a great addition for us to our mid-band spectrum position. Your question there about what are the issues, well, obviously, this is a new band. So \u2013 and it does have some complexity with coordination with the DoD to navigate. So that takes a little bit of time. The radio infrastructure is new. So that has to be brought on and made available. And obviously, supply chain can play in there. And then third, but certainly not the last issue, is handsets and devices. And so, we see kind of from the major OEMs availability on devices in this band tail end of this year, early next. So, for T-Mobile, our plan is to look at starting deployment of that 110 spectrum in 2023 in conjunction with the C-band spectrum that we purchased last year. And that's a one and done for us. That's a single radio. Unlike the AT&T approach you've heard about, which is two radios kind of integrated together. So, for us, I mean, we're looking to deploy the spectrum at the perfect time as we move into 2023. So very pleased with the outcome there. And I think the other important piece, as Mike referenced, we purchased spectrum in key areas of the country where the spectrum is most suited for deployment and capacity use. On the target for 260 million POPs by the end of 2022 and then 300 million by the end of 2023, nobody more excited about those numbers than me. That's one hell of a footprint and looks to really extend the powerful lead we have today. And are we going to be using roaming partners? I think they're going to be very few and far between. I think the question out there, Bill, is how many folks are going to be coming to T-Mobile and asking if they can roam on our great 5G with all of that footprint and capacity and capability that's out there. So, it's an organic build. I won't say 100%, but effectively, it's a T-Mobile build, so excited on both those. Sure. Yes. We'll split the two. Yes. Thanks, Simon. So obviously, this is a year with this powerful lead that we just talked about, we really want to press that home in 2022. And Mike referenced earlier, how this is our time. We've built a very, very high-performing deployment machine. It's not just deployment, its supply chain logistics, radio features, there's so much to pulling together this type of deployment at this pace, which is record breaking. So, while we have that wind in our sales, it's a great opportunity for us to really push the envelope and gap our competition. For Verizon to come close to what we're delivering, it's a multiyear task. And AT&T with their announced strategy have really said meaningful for our 5G customer \u2013 meaningful experience for our 5G customers, it kind of may start in 2023, maybe. So, they've almost put another year on the clock for themselves. So, they're also way behind. So, it's a perfect opportunity where we have such a high-performing machine. There's a bunch of other pieces in there, Simon. Obviously, we continue to expand and increase our coverage. We're working hard on in building and supporting Mike and the team on the TFB side. That's another area of growth for us. And we want to wrap up on this integration. Part of that program is upgrading a high volume of Sprint sites that we always said we would integrate and combine into the T-Mobile network, adding coverage and capacity. And part of the pull forward is to get all of that work done inside the 2022 envelope as well. So, lots of things ongoing, but we have incredible momentum. We have the crews, the equipment, the team, the process. And so, this is a great year for us to really look to extend that leadership we've now established."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Well, my buddy and I here are excited to be here today to discuss another remarkable year at T-Mobile. We shared with you a year ago that 2021 would be a foundational year for us as a merged company, a year in which we set bold goals for ourselves in terms of customer growth, profitability, network leadership and merger integration. Well, we not only exceeded our own targets, but also Wall Street's expectations. We are experiencing the greatest growth momentum in our history, setting record customer growth and service revenue growth, all because of the important investments we've made and will continue to make in our network leadership and in underpenetrated markets. This momentum sets us up for a very strong 2022 with plans to deliver another year of industry-leading postpaid growth, 10% in core adjusted EBITDA and over 30% growth in free cash flow at the midpoint of our guidance. We have big aspirations for this year, as Peter will explain more about in a minute. Our historic network build is a driving force behind our growth opportunity and it's central to unlocking our merger synergies. For the second year in a row, we set an audacious goal for Neville and the technology team, and they crushed it yet again. We set our sights on getting ultra capacity 5G to 200 million people and the team blew right past that goal, reaching 210 million in 2021. This is no small feat when you consider that it takes roughly 3x the number of cell site upgrades to get from 100 million to 200 million. And that gives you a sense of the challenge that AT&T and Verizon have ahead of them. Once they woke up to our 5G lead and differentiation, they finally began lighting up mid-band 5G POPs, but still only tens of millions compared to our hundreds of millions. According to their own build plan, it will take them multiple years to reach 200 million people, and they still won't be anywhere near the depth of mid-band spectrum that we're putting to work across our larger footprint. This demonstrates the remarkable deployment machine that we have spent years building and how hard it is to replicate. And don't forget our extended-range 5G reached 94% of all Americans at the end of 2021 with speeds double that of typical LTE. This reinforces the importance of not just having the best spectrum portfolio, but how quickly T-Mobile puts spectrum to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. We continue to add to our mid-band portfolio with our recent purchase in Auction 110. Once again, our prudent and opportunistic approach meant that we concentrated on supplementing our mid-band spectrum holdings in major urban and suburban areas, mostly aligned with our C-band purchases and importantly in places where these frequencies are well suited to the density of our network grid. That means we'll be able to deliver meaningful customer benefit with very little network capital and OpEx using existing towers, thanks to our completed agreements with American Tower and Crown Castle and we're not slowing down. We continue to extend our year's long 5G lead on the competition, and independent network experts continue to recognize this. More than 20 reports from third-party testing firms in the last year confirmed T-Mobile is tops in 5G speeding coverage. In Ookla's latest testing, T-Mobile delivered a clean suite of every category and we're not just talking about individual 5G category wins like speed and availability. This is important. T-Mobile also won for overall network performance meaning customers have a winning experience on the T-Mobile network period. Opensignal's new report published last week states that T-Mobile customers enjoy the fastest 5G speeds and can connect to 5G more often and in more places than anyone else. And the gap has only gotten wider as we keep increasing our speeds and reach. Meanwhile, AT&T somehow managed to see their 5G speeds get slower year-over-year with an LTE like 49 megabits per second. Okay. Let's talk about our industry-leading growth. Last year, we posted the best growth in our company's history. Across the entire span of our years' long Un-carrier journey, our best postpaid net add growth ever was in 2021. Our Magenta brand momentum is just incredible. And we added 1.2 million postpaid account net adds, doubling 2020's adds, the highest reported in the industry yet again. This measure of total billing relationships is the best barometer of winning the switching decisions in the industry, something we're famous for as the Un-carrier. And our highest-ever postpaid net adds were 5.5 million, leading the industry for the seventh consecutive year and exceeding the guidance that we raised again just last quarter. And our 2.9 million postpaid phone net adds were up 32% from last year, even during our accelerated Sprint customer integration. Thanks to the strength of our Magenta brand, we're delivering at best-ever levels. Our Magenta postpaid phone churn in 2021 was the lowest in the industry for the second year in a row. We exited the year with great momentum as well. In Q4, we not only had the highest phone gross adds in the industry, but also the highest in our history. This last quarter, interesting fact, our Magenta postpaid porting ratio was above 1.5x in Q4, and we're seeing those ratios trend even higher against AT&T and Verizon so far in Q1, while seeing our overall phone churn so far in Q1 move down seasonally just as expected. And to put this underlying momentum into perspective, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q4 would have been closer to 1.4 million and would represent the highest quarterly postpaid phone net adds in our history. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where T-Mobile was the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry in Q4. Let me say that again. In Q4, T-Mobile, and not Comcast, not Charter or AT&T or Verizon, posted the most broadband net adds in the industry, and we're just getting started. And mobile customers are taking our Magenta MAX plan in record numbers with over 55% of new customers choosing our best plan. This wasn't part of our playbook before and is now a tailwind as our continuously improving network perception and competitive device offers are enticing customers right to the top of our rate card. And there's still a huge potential upside here as fewer than 15% of our postpaid phone customers are on Magenta MAX or equivalent plans. This affects ARPU and ARPA. When we shared our plan with you at Analyst Day last year, we assumed postpaid phone ARPU would decline 1% every year through 2023, consistent with our historical trends and any benefit from the Magenta MAX would be upside to the plan. Well, you're already seeing that upside as we just delivered flat ARPU, actually up $0.01 in 2021. And not to steal Peter's thunder, but on the strength of this trend, we now see postpaid phone ARPU being flat to slightly up in 2022 for the first time ever. In addition, we've seen our prime mix of credit apps increase year-over-year every quarter in 2021, showing that our network and brand is consistently attracting some of the industry's best customers. We're off to a great start, bringing the same winning formula to smaller markets and rural areas. This is 40% of the country where we haven't meaningfully played before. We're growing our presence here as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. In just one year, our share has grown from approximately 13% to roughly 15%. Our share of port-ins in smaller markets and rural areas has increased multiple percentage points year-over-year, and these markets accounted for more than a third of our new accounts. This is one place our network leadership is beginning to shine. We're already the only 5G game in town for many of these communities. Our extended range 5G provides speeds more than double the average LTE and reaches nearly five times more geographic coverage than Verizon's 5G. And we're rapidly rolling out our Ultra Capacity 5G to more of these communities at an unprecedented clip, expanding our mid-band 5G coverage to five times the land area that we cover today. By the end of next year as we move from 210 million people covered to over 300 million exiting 2023. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon have finally started rolling out mid-band 5G and hope to soon be where we were almost two years ago. I'll say it again, we're two years ahead of AT&T and Verizon in 5G and two years from now will still be two years ahead. T-Mobile for Business had another great year as enterprise and government customers continue to do hands-on testing and when they do, they see the strength of our network. This differentiation on the network experience is delivering win share well above our market share. Just to put that in perspective, we're already, today, at a win share in enterprise and government that would get us to our targeted 20% market share by 2025, that's if we just hold our win share at current levels. And we've still got room to run. We're in many ways just beginning the expansion of our solutions and capabilities. Last week, others said they were still in proof-of-concept for advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks that they hope to commercialize at some point in the future. At T-Mobile, we already have commercial, revenue-generating agreements for advanced 5G solutions with multiple large corporations, including the federal government and a very large logistics company. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our ever-expanding 5G network lead. And let me just go back and touch just a little bit more on high-speed Internet. At the beginning of 2021, we were actually still in pilot. While we closed out the year with 646,000 customers, far exceeding our 500,000 target, it's abundantly clear that customers are loving the network performance and the simplicity of this 5G-based product. And with roughly 40% of high-speed Internet customers being new to T-Mobile, it creates another front door to fuel our mobile growth. We're excited about the revenue and margin contribution potential of this business as we ramp up further this year and next as our planned network capacity really hits its pace. T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is ready for its prime-time moment. And I think a lot of people are going to be surprised by how mainstream this product really is with our unique 5G network capacity to back it up. Okay, let's touch on our progress on our accelerated merger integration. While our Magenta business is firing on all cylinders, we're also successfully powering through the transition of the higher-churning Sprint customers faster than planned. At our Analyst Day last year, we laid out our post-merger plan to accelerate our integration, bringing many of our biggest milestones forward by a year or more. The Sprint customer network migration is an essential part of this integration. At the end of 2021, 64% of Sprint customers have been migrated onto the T-Mobile network, well ahead of the 60% target that we laid out back at Analyst Day. This is impressive in one year when you consider that less than 10% were migrated at the end of 2020. As we've previously said, we expect the billing migration to be relatively seamless to the customer as we begin to ramp up this final part of the integration over the course of 2022 and into the first half of 2023. As we enter the home stretch in 2022 for many of our Sprint customer integration initiatives, we believe that Q4 of 2021 was the high watermark for churn, in terms of our overall postpaid phone churn during the integration. Having seen the integration results so far, we're now confident that churn will improve because we've seen the performance of a now material cohort of migrations. As customers migrate to fully compatible devices anchored on the T-Mobile network and have a new EIP instead of leasing, they show churn rates similar to our Magenta customers. A sizable minority of Sprint customers have now hit these milestones. Completing these upgrades and migrations won't happen overnight, but the bottom line is simple. While others are temporarily padding their net adds from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short lived, which will create a growth tailwind for us, as you saw from our underlying Magenta performance while simultaneously creating a corresponding headwind for them. And we like those kinds of trends. Okay. Finally, before I wrap up, I do want to touch on our accomplishments as a leading corporate citizen in our industry. We not only set and exceeded our bold business and financial goals in 2021. We also stayed true to our commitments to use our new network, scale and resources for good, building a more connected, equitable and sustainable future for all of our stakeholders. T-Mobile was the first telecom to commit to sourcing 100% of our total electricity usage with renewable energy. And we're proud to announce this week that we're the first to achieve that goal, just another example of where we're leading the industry. We also further extended our leadership position in helping to bridge the digital divide. We're removing economic and geographic barriers in multiple ways. Our centerpiece is Project 10Million, which has already connected 3.2 million students with free or subsidized service. And we're expanding our high-speed Internet availability to millions of rural households, providing an important new connectivity option right where it's needed most. We also have an active participation in the government's affordable connectivity program through Metro by T-Mobile and Assurance Wireless, providing lower cost subsidized connectivity for many at a time when it's needed most. Okay. So let me sum it up. 2021 was our best year ever, and that's just because 2022 hasn't happened yet. Our positioning to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value is working while we also rushed to successfully expand into big underpenetrated segments. We saw strong ongoing growth ahead. We see it ahead in 2022 with a strategy that is really resonating with customers. Our network excellence has unlocked unprecedented growth for our Magenta brand, allowing us to move upmarket in urban and suburban areas with prime consumers and with enterprises and government. And at the same time, we've expanded our reach into smaller markets and rural areas and new product categories like high-speed Internet. We delivered big milestones in each of these areas in 2021 that really demonstrate our growth thesis with results. That customer growth helped to deliver industry-leading service revenue growth, and combined with our accelerated execution on our merger synergies, has enabled us to nearly double our free cash flow year-over-year in 2021. Only T-Mobile has this unique recipe with permission to win and room to run across multiple paths to unlock the massive shareholder value potential of this business. I'm incredibly excited to carry our momentum into 2022. This is a huge year, and there's no team I'd rather tackle it with. So, Peter, over to you. Hi, Phil. Hey, Phil, we lost you at the beginning. Can you start over? Yeah. Peter? And maybe Dow, you can give a little color on how it's going out there with mobile Internet and what we're seeing and why is 2022 going to be a bigger year? Yes. Last word on home Internet, Phil. I would say \u2013 I think some people are going to be surprised. I mentioned this in my remarks at how mainstream this product really is. And you certainly saw it in our growth numbers in Q4 where we beat the industry. But more importantly, you see it in our usage profiles. Average users are using 300 to 400 gigs a month. We have a mid-single digit using more than a terabyte. And people might say, well, that's not the same as cable. Cable uses more than that. But if you look at the broad distribution of cable users, their medians are right in that range. Their averages are only higher because they have some 10%, 20% of people that use multiple terabytes. Look, we can support some of that, too, as we're demonstrating today. But we don't have to target those people. I mean 80%, 90% of the customers are right in the sweet spot of where our product performs. And that's a wide, huge TAM for us. This is a very mainstream product for one reason. Our 5G is backed by the massive capacity of our rollout advancements and our spectrum portfolio. Nobody else is anywhere close or we'll give you quite some time. Yes, please, Phil. Yes. And it's \u2013 we don't have it exactly sized yet, and its low usage and no usage and lower revenue. But it's basically the people who you've offered them a phone completely brand-new, totally free phone several times, and they haven't responded. And in many cases, they have lower revenue profiles, little or no usage. And we don't have it perfectly sized yet. But it's \u2013 what Peter is trying to get at is it's not material to either our total subscriber enrollment nor our revenues. And so, at some point, when we begin our orderly transition, which looks like it's right on track for March 31, we'll begin that orderly shutdown of CDMA we'll do a residual base adjustment, but it won't have a material impact on our financials. And certainly, whatever impact we do expect is fully embedded in the guidance we shared with you today. You bet. Okay. Operator? Of course. I'll just take you back to Analyst Day because essentially nothing's changed. We're a year smarter, but all that year has done is demonstrate that the thesis we shared with you last year is completely intact, if not better than before. And what we said back then is that it's all predicated on the massive cash flow potential of this business, particularly in the years 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond. So, we set an aspiration of about a $60 billion program during those years, the possibility of starting sooner, and all of that remains intact because the thesis is intact. And you saw that we authorized a pretty good capital build for this year because we're running well ahead of schedule on integration. We want to get this thing behind us. That means next year's capital profile will be lower. We're going to see a significant step down in capital next year versus this year. We don't have any formal updates for you, but the entire thesis that that magnitude of buyback makes sense and is a great way to return value in those time frames, including the possibility of starting earlier, all of that's intact. But I can't really parse it for you any more than that in terms of our deliberations. So sorry about that. No. They haven't. And look, it's very straightforward. We are going to achieve in this time frame according to our outlooks investment grade. We are going to \u2013 according to our outlooks have the wherewithal to be able to do these buybacks. They're not in tension with one another. And there are no preset predicates to when we might pursue these things. But I don't have a formal update for you. Well, as you know, Craig, we also posted the biggest postpaid numbers in the entire industry in that same quarter you're asking about, Q4, the one we're reporting. And the highest postpaid net adds in our history in the full year 2021, all during which we're seeing this trend on cable, which isn't new. Cable had a strong quarter in Q4, but it wasn't an outsized quarter. I mean basically, it was 10.4% of gross adds. And we've been saying for a long time, we see them right around 10%. They've been consistent performers. And when you have those kinds of smaller bases that you'll see a little bit more variability in nets. But their activations are very consistent. And you see how we're thriving in that environment. And one of the issues is what you talked about. We think our value proposition is distinct, and it's resonating. And I'm really talking about the Magenta value proposition because that's the one we bring to the market. We talked about the fact that if Magenta churn matched Sprint churn, and they were both at the Magenta levels right now, which is certainly a long-term trend, this performance this last quarter would have been 1.4 million postpaid phone net adds, the highest in our history. And it's not meant to give you some alternate reality on Q4. It's meant to express what we see in the underlying trends of our business that don't always come through in the reports. So, look, we are coexisting with them. We've been coexisting with them and we're really just not concerned about some step change catalyst. Great. Operator, let's go back. Sure. Let me make a comment on churn, and then I'll hand it to Peter on what you can expect in terms of timing, so he can give you his usual non-answer on how it will all unfold during the year. But look, on churn, what I mentioned in my remarks is that we're, as expected, seeing a seasonal step down in churn. But we're also seeing an improvement in our relative performance with our underlying Magenta porting better so far in Q1 than in Q4, where it was already very strong. So, we're really pleased with the progress that we're seeing. And then underneath that, I mentioned that I believe that Q4 would be the high watermark quarter for churn overall, certainly through this multiyear integration period. And the reason why we were able to express some confidence in that is that you remember last time, I said there had been a small group of people that have sort of fully completed the migration. And we weren't sure if there was a selection bias or what was going on, but they looked exactly like or even a little better than Magenta. And now we have a significant cohort, millions that have moved across. It's still a minority. I mean, it's going to take some time because it's driven by upgrades, which are stepwise. But now we have a big material cohort of people who have a compatible device. They have one or more on their account T-Mobile payment plans or T-Mobile light payment plans, not the leasing, on a compatible device, domiciled on the T-Mobile network. And when you have those pieces in place, there are lots of pieces. But when you have those pieces in place, you see churn just like Magenta. And we have now a significant minority of Sprint customers that have that in place. And it makes sense. If you have one or more phones on your band that have to be every single one \u2013 a band is an account. If you have one or more phones that are on a new T-Mobile like payment plan, then you see how user-friendly it is versus the leases. You see how it performs on the network versus your prior product. And there's a dynamic there of having a level of commitment to the company. And so, you see that taste of Magenta and what it's like, and that corresponds to churn just like Magenta. So now we're able to say, look, we just got to get the job done. We have to sweep across all these bands, make sure that they have the experience of agenda, particularly compatible phones and compatible phone plans, and we're going to see the performance that we expect. And it's easier to predict now that we have a material cohort that's come all the way across. As to the time frames on some of the financials through the quarter, what kind of color can you share, Peter? Terrific. Okay. First to Peter. Yes. And on mobile broadband or fixed wireless, no, we're not really running into that. But remember, we're just operating at a different scale. So, in Q4, we delivered more net adds than Verizon has delivered in the entire time frame they've been swinging the bat on fixed wireless, three-years plus. So, we're operating at completely different scales. And you have to remember that while they're starting with mid-band 5G, they're starting with very small amount of geographic coverage and concentrating POPs in urban areas where it's easiest to do deploy. We started planning our mid-band 5G in 2018 with permitting and licensing and started rolling it out in earnest over two-years ago so \u2013 or about two years ago. So, we know that's a different opportunity. So, we're not really running into that much. As to their pricing, it's interesting what to see, where that goes. I'll tell you this, the response we're getting to our offers is phenomenal, the idea being able to have a product with massive capacity and mainstream usage, across vast class of this country for $50.0 including all taxes and fees, and no promotional like our wired into fine Verizon offers. That's really cool and that's resonating and we're not really not out to respond to other people's initiative, we're out the like customers with an offer with product. The think I think they will see is that it's backed by this massive capacity network, others \u2013 it just kind of shows a time-to-market advantage. Others do have massive capacity in a few places with millimeter wave, but they're also demonstrated issues there with self-install and other complications. And so, we feel like we've got the right sweet spot and we're just heads down executing our strategy and really not worrying about all the noise. You do capital, I'll do the FAA. Simon, just to double down on what Neville said. Neville's plan respects and understands that there's a lot more to a customer's network assessment than just our massive 5G lead. They also want coverage everywhere it matters to them. And we have such a great coverage footprint, but we've always talked about in our merger plan the idea of 10,000 incremental sites going after smaller markets and rural areas and pursuing great business opportunities for us in underpenetrated segments. And our thought is, let's get after that now and get it done. And so that's one of the reasons why you see the capital, but you don't see a different goal on the POP coverage other than around the margins on 5G because a big part of this is about chasing meaningful coverage for consumers and, as Neville said, for businesses. And we think that's very important to our overall competitive story. As it relates to the controversy, we see AT&T and Verizon embroiled in, first of all, it would be awfully tempting to sit on the outside of a controversy like that and take pot shots. But honestly, we think that in the final analysis after the work has been done, the studies have been completed, we think the wireless industry, AT&T, Verizon, the FCC positions will be validated. And we think they're right. So, these are different frequencies than what radio altimeters operate in. And a properly functioning radio altimeter, I think, will ultimately be shown not to be interfered with by C-band. I regret that this has been so widely reported as a 5G issue and that we've been a little left out of the story there. It would be great if what sold clicks for the press was to say, and by the way, T-Mobile is already nationwide with a frequency that has nothing to do with this controversy. But that doesn't really sell page views, and so it's not showing up in a lot of the reports. But as I said, when this \u2013 when everything is said and done and the assessments are completed this year and people take a breath because of the importance of this issue, I think the positions of AT&T, Verizon and the FCC will be validated. And that's our company's view. Obviously, we've taken interest in this because we hope to deploy C-band down the road. We're not in a rush. But to me, that's very important. And if it's ultimately found that some old or faulty radio altimeters are picking up stray signals, then I'm sure that the country will deal with that. I for one would prefer to have a world where there aren't old and faulty radio altimeters out there. So, look, we'll see how it all unfolds. But I think the positions of the industry and the FCC will ultimately be validated. Hi, John. Sounds great. Well, Dow, let's go back to you on some of these statistics on urban and suburban or on cable switchers, new to T-Mobile and what you're seeing also the ramp rate for this year next. Great. And then on the share buyback, I think what you're getting at, is there a preconceived milestone? And no, there's no particular preconceived milestone that we're looking for. And beyond that, I can't really update you on our deliberations and our Board's deliberations other than to repeat what I said a minute ago, which is that when we put out this thesis a year ago, we saw a future that of rapidly accelerating cash flow, massive value creation opportunity and the wherewithal to do $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 with the possibility of starting sooner. And everything we saw then is still intact and obviously, many of the underlying trends, as you saw with our great cash flow beat this year, if anything, are improving. Operator, let's go back to the next caller. You bet. Well, first of all, as it relates to the trends that Dow was saying, we see 2022 significantly bigger than 2021, and we see 2023 bigger than 2022. So, we do see a ramp-up happening. We probably fixed wireless is such a new industry, and we're by far the leaders in the U.S. I don't think there's a seasonality trend well established yet for this part of the industry. And so, look, we're going into places informed by our capital and our network capacity and where we're able to market. And there's so much great opportunity in smaller markets and rural areas, which I think we should talk about, both for mobile and for fixed. So, it's going to be a year of, I think, increasing momentum as essentially, we follow that network build. You remember in 2021, including Q4 with this record performance. We're still in the process of allocating capacity to the Destination Network. We're still in the height of an integration, and that capacity starts to massively increase and that opens up more and more doors for us because all of our opportunity in fixed wireless is centered around our excess capacity model being able to offer fixed wireless services in places where our analysis says mobile capacity won't take it up. As it relates to the second piece on marketing, I'll ask Jon Freier to comment on what he's seeing. And a big piece of this, Jon, is as consumers are trying to get to know us in smaller markets and rural areas and our brand differentiation with the Un-carrier, things like Netflix on us, Apple TV+ for a year, all of the things that we provide, some of which we're talking about in this question, what are people in smaller markets and rural areas nationwide seeing as it relates to our value proposition. Well then great. Let's go back to the phone. Sure. In that particular question, I think you were talking about DISH because we sure don't see wholesale going to zero but that's always been our plan with DISH is that ultimately, they would build their own network and wouldn't need ours. And as you know, the AT&T deal that they struck last year looked to us like it would accelerate that. And that's fully embedded in our guidance. So, I think we've previously disclosed that in 2021, our revenues from DISH were under $2 billion. The guidance we gave you today assumes that in 2022, it's a lot less than that, material step down in 2022. And \u2013 but at the same time, that means there's a materially less usage of our network from DISH, and that opens up other opportunities. First of all, in wholesale, we recently struck a deal to make sure we have a thoughtful transition with TracFone over multiple years, and that's something I think is very productive for both us and for Verizon. We have been able to strike a multiyear exclusive agreement with Google for the Google Offer, and that's very exciting. And we're in discussions with several other opportunities, both renewals and greenfield. So, and that's just in the wholesale area. The other opportunity, of course as these millions of customers come off our network is increased capacity for us to pursue our core business. And our core business is on fire. If there's nothing else, we've gotten across on this call, including the fixed wireless that's subject of so much interest today because that's a consumptive product, and it's all driven on a detailed excess capacity model. So as capacity frees up, that frees up new eligible households. So, lots of opportunity, but I wanted to be clear on at least what the guidance that Peter shared with you today assumed. And hopefully, that helps. Wow. Is it that time already? Okay. Great. Operator? Hi, Peter. Yes. It's a great question. Well, first of all, I would say that the question presumes some things about convergence, which I don't know how they will apply in the United States. One broad trend, if we're going macro, that we certainly keep in mind is the underlying health and vitality of mobile. The broad trends are that all content and communications of all kinds are leaving and have left their prior linear forms and landing on the Internet, and eyeball time and usage and customers on the Internet are going mobile. So, the broad trend is from linear to Internet to mobile. And we're the country's leading pure-play mobile Internet Company, and that is a great place to be. And we're backed by a differentiated asset base that really does have the ability to deliver massive capacity. We don't talk much about our second best in the industry millimeter wave portfolio, the years' long lead we have deploying spectrum against our mid-band leadership portfolio. And all of this builds to a position of massive potential capacity that we can use to create businesses. And those businesses may be pure connectivity or they may be things that surround connectivity as we're already starting to see in the enterprise space. In my remarks earlier, I said that we're entering actual revenue agreements for advanced 5G services with major organizations, including the Federal Government itself, not trials, but major agreements. And so, there's lots of opportunity when you have a differentiated asset base, a strong balance sheet, a killer brand, a creative, fast and entrepreneurial team and the wherewithal to be able to turn those things into businesses. What I can tell you is that we thought it through at a level deeper than that for the five- or six-year picture. And we see the trends that we've been describing to you pretty clearly within that time frame. And it gives us a lot of confidence in the massive shareholder value creation that we see ahead. I hope that helps. Okay. Great, Peter. Well, Jud, anything \u2013 any final words? Bye, everybody."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Michael Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements that contain a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review.  Our earnings release Investor Fact Book and other documents related to our Q3 results, as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020, represents standalone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. I would also like to note, that we are now in the quiet period for auction 110 and will not comment on that today. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\nMichael Sievert: Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody, it's so great to be here to share this quarter's results with you, and as you might have noticed, we are entering the home stretch for 2021, and our team, is feeling more confident than ever. We've exceeded not only Wall Street expectations, but even our own targets at this stage of our integration journey in terms of customer growth, profitability, and synergies. And with that success, we are once again increasing our guidance expectations, across the board today.  The un -carrier is about solving pain points. And you may remember that when we closed our merger last year, we said that our combined assets meant that we would end the biggest pain point of all, that age-old problem of having to choose between the best network and the best value. We said we'd be in a unique position as the new un -carrier, with our unique assets and financial position in the 5G era to end that trade-off and deliver both.  Well, let me tell you, this differentiated playbook that has never been done before in wireless is already contributing to our results, and creating market-leading profitable growth where it counts in top-line postpaid customers and revenues, and in cash flows at the bottom line. Only T-Mobile provides the best value proposition, with truly unlimited plans, fairly priced on the best 5G network and with award-winning service.  This combination is differentiating our model from the other guys and uniquely positioning T-Mobile in significant ways that have long-term implications. In Q3, we led the industry in postpaid net adds and postpaid service revenue growth. Again, just as we've done every quarter since we closed the merger, we also led the industry in core EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth.  Let's talk about a few of the highlights that are driving all of this growth. Smaller markets and rural areas are already contributing about one-third of our new accounts, and brand equities are up across the board. And we're still in the very early innings of our distribution expansion and ultra-capacity build-out in smaller markets. In enterprise, we delivered our highest ever gross adds and net adds because organizations really understand our 5G leadership better than anyone.  For 5G high-speed Internet, we delivered our highest-ever net adds in Q3, more than Tableau (ph) Verizon, and two-thirds of our net adds came from urban and suburban markets. In other words, cable territory. All right. Coming back to my point on how T-Mobile is uniquely positioned in our industry, I understand that many of you have raised questions about the promotional environment and also about the source and sustainability of recent industry growth. And some have actually question whether 5G really matters to consumers.  While I do believe this is a healthy and growing industry, I understand that the actions of some of our peers may have soured sentiment on our category for some. So today, I'm purposely focused on addressing these perceptions head-on and sharing my view of how our approach and competitive position is differentiated, both for customers and for T-Mobile's business. The first question I'm sure it's top of mind, is the promotional intensity in this industry. Listen, as I've said before, at T-Mobile, we actually like healthy competition. Because we historically win, when customers start shopping around, our competitors are leaning into device offers. And while I can't really explain what they're up to, I can't imagine it's out of abject fear that were coming to take all their customers, because they don't have compelling pricing or a competitive 5G network or significant under-penetrated growth factors like T-Mobile has, so they are trying to temporarily buy-down churn while they sell off assets and come up with a plan. In contrast, our competitive push into device offers is strategic. Listen, we have a once in a decade opportunity to leap ahead and stay ahead of everyone else as customers embrace 5G.  We're years ahead on 5G, as you know, and we're positioned to stay ahead. And we're, therefore, incented to get people on 5G so they can experience that advantage. Every time we upgrade a customer from 4G to 5G, we take them from a device that works similarly on all three big networks, to a device that works way, way better at T-Mobile.  And secondly, we are laser-focused on completing our merger integration ahead of schedule. This is huge because of the significant churn opportunity that we have, which is why we're putting device offers in place to bring Sprint customers to T-Mobile as quickly as possible. And unlike some, we generally pay for all of this in our P&L as we go along. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon are running expensive promotions to put 5G devices in their customers' hands even though they are unlikely to find a much faster 5G signal or notice a difference in speeds most of the time.  In fact, every time they upgrade a customer from a 4G device to a 5G device, they're playing right into our strength and spending a fortune to do it. And in AT&T 's case, racking up billions of dollars of future impacts on their Balance Sheet. How do their customers feel when they take that shiny new 5G phone home, only to realize that most of the time it works just like their 4G phone. At T-Mobile, those devices work demonstrably better, with ultra capacity 5G reaching more than half the country today, rocking speeds of 400 megabits per second on average. Every one of those competitive customers being upgraded to 5G, at great expense, is a potential future T-Mobile customer. The second question is around the source and sustainability of recent customer growth in the industry. This one would be easier to answer if everyone in our industry was as transparent as T-Mobile such as disclosing accounts or what adjustments are being made, etc.  What I do know is that T-Mobile has a diversified growth opportunity in underpenetrated and new markets that's unmatched in this industry. One way to cut to the chase is to look at accounts instead of lines. Our postpaid net new accounts in Q3 doubled year-over-year with our highest Q3 account growth in 7 years, even while in the thick of our integration. We're up more than 1 million net new accounts year-over-year.  We did this while Verizon had no account growth year-over-year, and AT&T didn't disclose accounts. And what's more, we see significant opportunities ahead, in smaller markets and rural areas. We're leading America into the 5G era, as we march toward covering 300 million people, with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2023, a time by which others only aspire to cover a 175 million to 200 million people. The difference in geographic coverage between 200 million and 300 million people is huge, roughly 5 times the land area, giving us a big competitive advantage in smaller markets and rural areas. Listen, as the Un -carrier in smaller markets, we are combining a suddenly much stronger network with disruptive value and the best customer service. Does that sound familiar? It should. Newly competitive network combined with disruptive value and customer experience. That's exactly the Un -carrier playbook we ran over the last few years in the tab markets. We're bringing the same playbook to smaller markets and rural areas that took us from number 4 to number 1 in the major metros, except in the smaller markets, we're not just bringing a competitive network.  Our goal is to bring a superior one, anchored by our advantage in 5G. And let's not forget that in major markets, we have room to run. We're not just defending our castle. We got to our current leadership position without being perceived as having a network advantage. Now, we have the opportunity to appeal to millions more customers in the larger markets as well, who shop primarily on network, reach, speed, and capacity. In enterprise and government markets, another big opportunity where our 5G leadership has already opening new doors.  We've already seen an increase in our win share for traditional postpaid services, and we're well-positioned to capture advanced 5G services with the widest built-out 5G network and the only standalone 5G core, which is exactly why many large enterprises are in active trials with T-Mobile for advanced capabilities like mobile edge compute and private networks. And let me remind you, that these advanced 5G services represent upside to our plan. Bottom line, our competitors are broadly distributed today. They're already in smaller markets in rural areas and they already have outsized share in enterprise.  And they're overpriced with little 5G to show for it, making it tough for them to defend their flanks when we come in with a better network and a better value. I say all this, not to bash anybody, but to make it clear that as competition heats up, you shouldn't paint us all with the same brush. T-Mobile is executing and demonstrating that these profitable growth opportunities are real and they are differentiated. As part of that industry growth debate, I hear misperceptions out there that T-Mobile's growth has slowed relative to our pre -merger momentum.  And I'd love to set the record straight on this one. What we look out proudly is our Magenta performance as a signal of our future success. We delivered our highest ever postpaid phone net adds on the Magenta brand, year-to-date through Q3. Our highest ever in Company history happening now. This year, even after normalizing for Sprint transfers into Magenta, the uncarrier strategy is in full force and we're competing smartly, and the result is high quality, profitable, industry-leading growth.  With our Magenta business firing on all cylinders, we're also working rapidly through the integration of the higher churning Sprint base. Just to put this in perspective, if the Sprint base had the same churn as our Magenta base, our phone net adds in Q3 would've been about 1.2 million way ahead of anyone else in the industry. That shows you the potential future tailwind to our growth engine as we work to get Sprint churn down to Magenta churn levels. And it reinforces that our gross adds flows are right where we want them to be, at least for this point in our journey.  While others are temporarily benefiting from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short-lived. With over 1/2 of Sprint customers, at least partly migrated, we continue to execute our playbook to finish the integration in a compressed time frame. Which does have temporary impacts, but brings forward the time frames when both the customer experience and our business results, have the benefit of integration being behind us. I'm so proud of how the team is executing to get all this done way ahead of schedule. And we're particularly encouraged by what we see from Sprint customers, that have made the full migration to the T-Mobile value proposition.  As they already have churn on par with Magenta customers. Changing gears. I've seen some media articles and analysts notes commenting on how consumers should be indifferent between 5G and 4G, given the limited availability and similar performance. While they're absolutely right when they look at AT&T and Verizon. Those companies have much more geographically distributed customer bases and only a small percentage of their customers are seeing big benefits from 5G, and nor are a high percentage of them likely to see a benefit from their early C-band deployments.  At T-Mobile, 5G is a distinct differentiator. Here's a fun fact for you, over 75% of T-Mobile 5G customers are within our ultracapaciy 5G coverage area that now reaches 190 people. Well, over half of the country, enjoying blazing fast speeds of around 10 times faster than 4G. Ask AT&T and Verizon what percentage of their customer bases are in the footprint of their fastest 5G. And at T-Mobile -- and T-Mobile's 5G leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. We see this demonstrated in several areas.  The first area where we see our network leadership resonating is in perception metrics among non-customers, or in other words, potential future customers. According to our pulling, perception for overall network reliability has increased over 20% year-over-year and is now higher than AT&T. Our recognition as the 5G leader among potential customers has increased over 80% from a year ago. 80%, matching Verizon, while Verizon scores are flat to down, and we scored three times higher than AT&T. Potential customers are taking notice of our lead.  The second aspect is the adoption of Magenta MAX, the best plan on the best 5G network. Take rates continue to exceed our expectations, and we now see more of that half of new customers choosing MAX. The engagement that we have seen just reinforces our belief that the 5G smartphone is the first killer app of the 5G era. From video calling, which has taken off as a primary means of communication, to TikTok and mixed reality and emerging metaverse applications, T-Mobile's network is unlocking a differentiated smartphone experience in this industry today.  We see this not only in the take rates that I mentioned, but also in the way that customers are taking advantage of this differentiated experience using 35 gigabytes a month on average when pairing Magenta MAX with a 5G smartphone. 35 gigs a month all ready, that's roughly tripled the average 4G usage in the industry and an experience that AT&T and Verizon will be hard pressed to support from a capacity perspective. And did you see those new offers from the cable guys? Cable is constructing 4G offers in a 5G world, and they will be challenged without wireless owner's economics.  Never mind the fact that they are on the smallest 5G network, Verizon. They already automatically throttle anyone using more than 20 gigs and they are quite limited, so-called unlimited plan today. That might barely cut it with some consumers for a very short time, but not where this industry is quickly going. And the final question I want to address is around the quality of earnings in this industry. Sure, there are geography differences and some maybe aren't reflecting the full magnitude of their promotional spending in their EBITDA. at the end of the day cash is key.  And real value creation should be measured by the conversion of service revenues into free cash flow. T-Mobile has unmatched potential, because of our industry-leading growth and synergy back to model. And we've guided to deliver a significant CAGR of 45% from 2021 to 2024. From our perspective, the current market valuation of our Company based on our guided free cash flow, would suggest that there is significant potential shareholder value not yet reflected.  Before I wrap up, I do want to comment on the cyber-attack we experienced last quarter. As we previously reported and updated in our filings today, we promptly located and closed to the unauthorized access to our systems after becoming aware of this criminal cyber-attack against T-Mobile and our customers. And we conducted a forensic investigation, with the assistance of world leading cybersecurity experts.  That's now complete. We also undertook extensive efforts to support and protect our customers and to further enhance our cybersecurity practices throughout this process. Protecting our customer's data is a top priority for the Company, which is why we've taken a number of steps to respond to this incident. And I've created a Cyber Transformation Office, reporting directly to me, elevating our cybersecurity team in this work accordingly. We're further building a security forward mindset into our work and our culture, and we're partnering with the best and the brightest like Mandiant and KPMG to help us do it right.  Now, before I turn it over to Peter to take us through a few financial highlights and our outstanding guidance, I want to express how proud I am of this team. We executed another terrific quarter leading the industry and postpaid customer growth while delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid subscribers. postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. All while further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. Overall, our strategy is absolutely working and we clearly have the best hand of cards to win in the years ahead. All right, Peter, over to you.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered strong results yet again in Q3 as we executed our winning playbook and exceeded expectations across the board. Let's start by talking about growth, where we doubled our postpaid account net adds from a year ago, adding 268,000. And as Mike mentioned, that is the highest account net adds for Q3 in 7 years.  We also delivered industry-leading postpaid net adds of 1.3 million including 673,000 postpaid phone net adds. This growth contributed to our record service revenue, including industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 6% year-over-year.  And we were the only national provider to grow margins year-over-year. We delivered record high core adjusted EBITDA and our Forex increase on free cash flow from a year ago is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey, and the unlocking of significant shareholder value. I'm also extremely proud of the team as we continue to work with the rating agencies.  And in August, all 3 agencies upgraded us based on the Company's continued strong financial results and momentum with Fitch moving to an investment-grade corporate family rating. These upgrades will provide us with significant incremental flexibility to further optimize our capital structure. Let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beaten raise quarter.  We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.1 and 5.3 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities, from increased switching activity expected in Q4. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23.4 and $23.5 billion. Primarily driven by service revenue growth and higher merger synergies, which are now expected to be between $3.2 billion, as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization.  We expect merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between 2.8% and $3 billion before taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities including merger payments is now expected to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.0 billion. We expect cash capex to be between $12.1 billion and $12.3 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration.  Together, this results in a free cash flow including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. Our Q3 effective tax rate was materially below our prior 2021 guide of 24% to 26% primarily due to state tax benefits associated with certain legal entity reorganizations. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in Q4, which would put us at about a 15% to 17% rate for the full year.  One last guidance item that I'll note is that we now expect full-year postpaid phone ARPU to be relatively flat to the 47, 74 full-year rate in 2020. This is driven by the fact that Q4 ARPU is trending flat to Q3 as a result of benefits from continued Magenta MAX adoption amongst our customers and converting device insurance products for our Sprint customers to the equivalent Magenta products, which have higher revenue recorded and higher EBITDA contribution. Both of which are expected to offset the typical seasonal promotional ARPU impact in Q4.  And we expect full-year ARPA to be up more than $2 from last year, driven by our strategy to continuously expand our revenue within our account relationships. Before I wrap up, I'd like to come back to Mike's points on addressing questions out there. Some have questioned the real drivers of service revenue growth in the industry, which for some has been supported by grossing up third-party content and cable MVNO growth. At T-Mobile, our growth is primarily driven by our retail business, as evidenced by an industry bet, 6% growth in postpaid service revenue. And our content costs are treated as contra revenue. That's a reduction to our ARPU.  And 1 final point around the quality of earnings in the industry. Several analysts have written about how AT&T has rung up over $4 billion of promotions on their Balance Sheet, and how pressure their ARPU and margins for years to come. However, I think the industry has been unfairly painted with a broad brush based on the actions of one player. At T-Mobile, we take most of our promotional expenses upfront with only a minimal amount amortized through the balance sheet. No point in kicking the can on expenses when you are a sustainable growth Company.  Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A. Jud?\nJud Henry: All right. Let's get to your questions. [ Operator instructions] All right. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.\nMichael Sievert: Hi, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. Appreciate it. Let's talk about the CDMA slowdown impact. I know you're thinking of planning to shut down LTE at the end of next year, anyway. How should we think about the CDMA a little bit delayed. And then second, can you just talk about the -- with everything going on in the base, whether it's Dish and AT&T and everything else, but your confidence in growing EBITDA by double digits next year. Is that a reasonable expectation for the industry? Thank you.\nMichael Sievert: Thanks, Phil. I'll start with the first one, and maybe hand it to Peter and he'll go ahead and guide you on '22, three months in advance. On CDMA, yeah, I think most of what we had to say was in our disclosure at the time. We've been in talks with all the other parties involved, including the Department of Justice. And following those talks, we just decided to take upon ourselves to voluntarily move that date out by 3 months and plan to sunset the CDMA network at the end of March.  And we did that after carefully looking at our own plans and determining that there wouldn't be a material impact from doing that to our outlook or our financials, our ability to deliver use synergies as expected. But we did want to make sure that everyone involved had the time that they needed to make sure that we meet the Department of Justice.  What I know is, is there\u2019s a goal in the public interest, which is to make sure that every single customer out there has the opportunity and is given the opportunity to switch to the superior network in time. Now, as we've said all along, we believe that December 31 provides that ample time, and we've given everybody involved well over a year way more notice than they needed. But when we look at the actual run rates, it looked to us like even at the current rates, an extra 3 months would be something that everyone would appreciate.  And so, I'd like our partners to be moving faster, they don't appear to be, and because we just took that voluntary action on our own. And we think this is based on everything we're seeing, we think this is all that would be necessary, and so that's something that we we\u2019re pleased to be able to do. As it relates to all the pros and cons and effects on EBITDA for next year, we're looking forward to an exciting '22, but I doubt Peter will give you a much on it, but I\u2019d hand to my friend Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Phil, we'll certainly provide a full update and guide you as part of our year-end call. But let me give you a couple of points around how we think about '22. First, I know there's been questions around what's the potential impact of DISH, and I think we highlighted it well at our Q2 earnings call. DISH revenue is already under $2 billion in '21. And as we look about how the business momentum is continuing, we said that was always part of the plan.  Again, we took DISH on their word and always assumed that they would become a full facilities player, and during the duration of the LRP, that revenue would go away, and you heard us recommit and we're doing it again today around the \u201823 and the \u201926 service revenue guidance, given the underlying strength for the business. And so, that is probably the area where I'm most excited. I mean, you saw the results today, you've seen the net account additions and the real growth around not just postpaid phone but postpaid other.  One of the areas of the business that I would like to highlight for '22 is probably ARPU, and with the momentum that we've seen in our updated guide just now to be relatively flat full-year '21 to full-year '22, I see a path with Magenta MAX and the excitement there from our customer base to be less than 1% dilution in '22. And remember, that's off of a higher base in 2021, which is now going to be flat to 2020. The other area, I'd say is really where we're excited is free cash flow.  And you see what's happening are continually raising our guide this year as you look into the 10-Q you also see it's allowed us to take opportunity and do significant prepayments with certain vendors and generate flexibility and savings. And that working capital is already fully contemplated in our updated guide today. So, as we think about '22, I'm very excited about the opportunity for free cash flow. And as Mike said, that really is the ultimate expression of value creation in how you take that service revenue and translate it into cash flow.\nJud Henry: Perfect, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Pete.\nJud Henry: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman : Thanks. Maybe just to start off with a follow-up question. Thank you for giving us some of that insight into next year. Why would postpaid ARPU still have dilution next year? The sequential trend has obviously been pretty positive as you've been moving customers into the MAX plan and you're deeper into the integration, so any other puts and takes that really just would play out over the next few quarters, would be appreciated.  And then the comment you made about how strong your phone net adds would've been if Sprint churn was aligned with legacy Magenta churn, implies you're losing a couple of a hundred thousand Sprint subs a quarter still at this stage in the integration with 90% of the Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network and over half those customers having been moved over, what's your experience been with the point at which a Sprint customer takes on the characteristics of a legacy Magenta customer. In other words, at what point could we see a material positive inflection in the aggregate Sprint losses? Thank you.\nMichael Sievert: Terrific. I'll start with the second one and then maybe hand it to Peter on the first one, and I'll ask Jon if he has anything to add on the first one. On Sprint churn, listen we're really pleased with what we're seeing, but you have to bear in mind that what we're doing in this strategy is we're compressing integration into a tighter time frame, and that means that whatever Sprint churn is going to happen as a function of integration is going to happen in a shorter period of time and affect the integration periods to a greater extent. And our Sprint customers are showing us a tremendous number of patients as we give them a much better 5G network experience and get them migrated over. But still as anybody who follows this industry knows, when you have an integration during that period of integration, there can be puts and takes for customers. And we're trying to do our best to give every customer a great experience. As it relates to what we're seeing, when somebody comes across from Sprint to Magenta in what we call a full migration, and there aren't that many that have a full migration yet. So, there could be some selection bias here.  That means you're fully on the T-Mobile network. You're fully on the T-Mobile biller. You're engaged with the T-Mobile brand. You've moved to T-Mobile tax inclusive rate plans and you're experiencing T-Mobile team of expert service. So, where we're going? Where we're going very quickly for everyone. Those customers that have come all the way across are showing so far this about the same churn profile as Magenta customers, and that's very exciting because Magenta is on par with anybody out there and many time periods has been the best in the industry. So that's really promising.  Now, I think while we have the opportunity because we're compressing the time frames and we're only seeing somewhat elevated churn to actually come through this integration with less overall losses than we would have expected from the Sprint side, because it's happening during a compressed time frame. We are very pleased with those trends and we're -- you'll see us in our actions with things like our Sprint forward initiative and things like our device offers moving to get Sprint customers the handsets they need, particularly 600 megahertz compatible handsets, as well as everything else they need to take full advantage of their Magenta network.  And before we go on to ARPU, I know John, if you'd like to add anything to what you're seeing and what your team is seeing with Sprint customers because it's one of the most important questions I think we'll talk about today. Because as you saw, the underlying Magenta performance is unbelievably great and we just have to get through the synergy. What are you seeing, John?\nJud Henry: Well Mike, you -- I think you hit on a number of things that we're seeing within our team here. And Mike, what you said is that we've got to make sure that we bring this full experience, and we've done this integration in the last 18 months in disparate parts, with rate plans for one, two, moving traffic and changing our SIM cards. But really bringing the full experience together, like Mike said, great T-Mobile, tax inclusive plans, 1, 2, having the latest and greatest devices with the full network capabilities associated with those licenses, namely 600 megahertz.  Because if you don't have a 600-megahertz device on the T-Mobile network, it's like the T-Mobile network from 2015, so it's really important that we do that. And then of course, the award-winning team of experts, customer experience, and bringing all that together, not being enough. Still in a Sprint application, you're logging the sprint.com, you're going through a Sprint app, moving the whole experience over to T-Mobile, that's the big on lot for us.  That's what we're really focused on. We've been putting a lot of effort and a lot of work starting in Q3 on moving the full accounts over and not doing that in discrete events, but we started that an earnest in Q3. We've seen great results from that, so far. When you take a look at the customers that we're porting out from Sprint and they were coming back in a T-Mobile, we've seen dramatic increases since we put a number of initiatives in place back in August of this year, and in Q3 and that we're still running so far in Q4.  I'm really pleased about that. We continue to be bullish, like Mike said. It's going to be a compressed overall timeframe during that. For any of you who -- I have been covering this business for a long time. Integration of migrations and those things are tough, are always a little bit painful and are always a little bit grilling, but as I take a look at my 27 years in this business in terms of how we've been handling, this migration and overall integration, I would say it's first-in-class and best-in-class.  We got a lot of work still to do in front of us, no question about that, but we're well on track to do what we need to do in 2022 and beyond. I hope you understand why we see Tailwinds ahead. Because obviously we're in the height of this integration right now. And we have a lot of work left to do. We have a lot of keeps sites that need to come over on the Magenta side still that there's still on the Sprint side. We have a lot of handset migrations to do so, people can take full advantage of that destination network. And we have lots of migrations that we need to do on customer service, on rate plans, on the full picture.  A lot of work ahead and -- but our goal is to get it all done at least a year ahead of schedule. We're very focused on that and you've seen us show up each time with updates telling you we're going faster than expected. Brett, the second part of your question, I can roughly paraphrase as -- Peter, you promised us negative 1% ARPU this year, and we're going to pull into the station sounds like with flat ARPU after all. So why isn't that going to happen again next year?\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. Brett. Let me -- as you know, right? Underpinned assumption under the LRP was 1% dilution year-over-year through the end of 2023 because the plan was really always focused on how do you get account growth and how do you expand those relationships and have ARPA growth. So, as we look forward to next year, there's a number of things that could impact, and certainly we talked about the great momentum from Magenta MAX and other value-add services that will be a tailwind to ARPU.  But as you think about some of the growth opportunity areas for you, and I'll give you one example which would be large enterprise in government, where our actual phone ARPU maybe lower than our blended base, and so you're going into a new account relationship and enterprise or government where that might be ARPU dilutive, but certainly a very strong ARPA type of relationship.  And typically, you also see a lot of the postpaid other, the other connected devices where in many cases, the CLV amongst those are much stronger than the phone business in and of itself. So that's one area where you could see ARPU dilution and yet tremendously value accretive to T-Mobile from a whole account relationship. So, I'm not going to give you all the puts and takes. You got to let you leave me something to guide you on at year-end earnings instead of Q3. But certainly, great momentum and again, focused on ARPA expansion throughout the course of this plan.\nBrett Feldman : That's great. Thank you.\nJud Henry: Okay. Brett. Okay, operator, we'll get back to the phone and then just to prepare the team, if you can call out one or two, you see on the Twitter feed that be great, we'll do that after this next one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett : Hi. Two questions for you, if I could. One, now, that we've seen your numbers and everybody else's, the industry growth rate is now pushing even higher to a total phone subscription, prepaid and postpaid combined, to almost 3%. So now, what 7 times population, I wonder if you could just talk about what you're seeing there.  Is that [Indiscernible] or what is making the industry grow the way it is? And then second, there's been a lot of talk about convergence from your competitors about what they can do with fiber and their wireless plans. I wonder if you could just talk about how you see the role of combined offers of wireless and wireline and whether you think that that or fixed wireless and whether you think that's critical to be competitive.\nMichael Sievert: Terrific, well I'll start with the first one. I don't think we have all the answers as to what's driving account growth or line growth over at all of our competitors and you don't see quite the same amount of transparency. It's one of the reasons why we decided to start talking much more about accounts and about ARPA because there's no ambiguity in that. Our 268,000 net new accounts relationships on the postpaid side was the largest in 7 years for a Q3.  And you see ARPA rising and so it shows you the quality of that business. One of the things we didn't talk about is that our prime percentage is up several points from a year ago. I mean we're getting more and more prime, not surprisingly, because we have a better and better network. So, attract -- where it's starting to attract to higher levels the best customers in the industry.  And so, for us, it's not some of the things that you might expect. It's not EBB because we have no material EBB in our numbers. Generally, that program is over on our lifelines side, which isn't in our subscriber goals, but is for our competitors in to a certain extent. It's not due to subprime, it might be for our competitors, but our prime mix continues to improve.  It\u2019s not due to some weirdness of lines underneath the accounts because you see account growth and ARPA growth, very healthy. And you see that flowing through to industry-leading postpaid EBITDA growth, as well as industry-leading cash flow growth. And so, look, I don't know how sustainable it is. Prepaid is about flat, so there's certainly been some amount of transference there from what you would've expected to be an organic rate.  I don't know how sustainable it is. But what investors should ask themselves is if it doesn't become sustainable, who's going to win? and who has a reliable ongoing strategy that will be able to deliver growth in all the different time periods? And look, for us, we have a strategy and a set of assets. It's going after majorly under-penetrated segments, like small markets in rural areas which are 40% of the country. Like enterprise, like home broadband, your second question. These are huge places where we don't play and the other guys do.  And so that -- between that and our massive lead in 5G, we're 2 years ahead on the 5G race and I'm here to tell you that in 2 years from now we'll be 2 years or more ahead in the 5G race. And that's going to translate as well to opportunity for us. And so, look, I think there is some amount of temporary that's happening with the other guys. They're feeding to a small extent on our integration driven Sprint churn, investors will have to ask themselves whether you believe that's going to be very short-lived and not only not be a tailwind for them anymore, but will turn around.  We'll see how that goes, but we're really pleased with where things are going and what's the underlying trends. Now your second question is about convergence and about home broadband. First, I want to talk about how we're doing as being a multi category player with our push into home broadband and then maybe we can talk about the question on fiber, etc.\nPeter Osvaldik: So, question on convergence is, we'll have to see. But one thing we do know is that consumers are beginning to realize that there are choices. And they aren't having to put up with what they get today. What we're seeing is that while there are a lot of places, there are very limited choices in terms of what their cable or fiber offering are, and those offerings are typically very punitive.  They start out with promotions, they explode those, they end up paying very, very high prices, fees for modems, the other taxes, other charges that customers don't like. What's translating for us in that is that we're seeing customers, the majority of our customers, are not only coming as Mike mentioned, from urban and suburban areas, but they're also coming from cable and fiber providers.  And why is that? Well, a big part of that is customers want a good product and a great price, and that's what they're getting with our products. And so, we're seeing people come in and say, this is a product that actually works. And you know what, I'm paying an amount that doesn't explode, I'm paying a very fair amount, and I don't have to be extremely irritated about having my existing cable companies gouge me on these things.  And so, for us, this has resulted in what we've seen is our highest net add quarter since we launched the product. And we see continued momentum from people coming from cable fiber. And quite frankly, even other sources, DSL, satellite, etc., and rural markets. So as our 5G ultra capacity network gets built, more and more, we're going to continue to follow that and begin giving more and more customers choice. We're still very excited about this product.\nMichael Sievert: Perfect. Okay. Well, let's go -- Jud, let's see what's on Twitter and then we'll come back to the phones after that.\nJud Henry: Sounds good. We've got a great question here. Can you talk about potential enterprise 5G use case opportunities?\nMichael Sievert: Let's go right to my [Indiscernible]\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Perfect. Well, as Mike talked about the beginning, let's not forget that the first big 5 -- killer 5G use case is core connectivity, smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices, and I'm really proud to say that we have seen our win rate continue to improve in that area, and our win rate is trending well above what our market share is, and continuing to improve like we saw in Q3.  And that's resulting in huge growth. If you just look at what's happened over the course of the last 2 years from 2020 to now, our growth in core connectivity is more than 50% better than Verizon 's. in the business space. So, we're seeing that the correlation of us as T-Mobile emerging as the 5G leader correlate with this big growth in core connectivity in business. But your question around these additional 5G use cases.  One of the things that we talked a little bit about in last earnings is we're involved in multiple trials with enterprise and government customers. And we think we're really well-positioned to bring these new enterprise advanced network services to market because of the way that we've delivered our 5G network. Mike has talked a lot about the scale of our network covering a 190 million people with our ultra -- our mid-band 5G network.  But we also have some other key features that we've built our 5G network around that are really positioning us well to differentiate on these 5G use cases, like the fact that we've got a dedicated 5G network core. So, our 5G traffic isn't running through our 4G network first. It's -- we have a dedicated network core that's delivering better performance for customer and customer applications. And also gives us the ability to bring really cool features to market like network slicing that we think is going to be a big opportunity for us with enterprise and government customers in the future.  We have a highly distributed network of data centers so we can help customers process data closer to their application on average than our competitors can. And so, we've got a number of these trials going with customers right now. And these are big, even though you don't see us doing press releases every single week about this, we have big customers with big significant use cases like for instance, we're working with one of the largest airlines in America right now on a mobile edge use-case application that allows them to process data faster, under-weighing, and improve their on-ground operations at one of their major hubs.  We're working with one of the largest U.S auto OEMs to help support a bunch of self-driving use cases and autonomous fleet that they're building. So, we're working with some of the biggest companies in the world helping co-innovate these solutions with them. And we think we're really well positioned because of the engineering decisions that Neville, and his team made to differentiate on these advanced 5G network use cases for our enterprise and business customers going forward.\nJud Henry: Terrific. Operator, let's go back to the thump.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Mike, your SOGA is the lowest it's been in the third quarter since you guys close the merger. And I understand that sort really a flare -- I stare measure based, given that you guys said earlier in the year on the second quarter call, that you're really saving your dry powder for the period of the year where switching is going to be high, presumably that's now -- and so I'm wondering if you can give us some insights into what you think has happened to your share of decisions since the iPhone and launched in September?\nMichael Sievert: Yes, one of the things that we've talked about, and I think you heard in Peter's earlier remarks, is that after listen, we did see to the first question and impact from the data breach that happened in August, and there was a muted effect there because of that, I was quoted early in the Fourth Quarter saying that we finished much stronger and we were seeing nice trends as we entered the Fourth Quarter. And that shows that this was while a big event and something were very-very sorry happened. Something that customers have generally prepared themselves to move on from. And so that's good.  On the other hand, look, our model, one of the things I pointed out was that if you were to normalize our churn and look at what it may look like after we are finished with this integration. And just for a minute, I don't know if it will look like this, but just for a minute to say, what if all of our churn was at the Magenta levels. Our net adds this quarter, with that SOGA figure you talked about, would've been 1.2 million on the postpaid phones side. By far the biggest in the category and outsized versus time periods in our history as well.  And it really shows you that SOGA level that we're getting is reliable, sustainable, and about where we want it for this point in our journey. What you don't see us doing, Jonathan, that you may see elsewhere is kind of knee-jerk reactions and lurches into unanticipated, very expensive promotions, etc. etc. With no strategic apparent linkage behind it. And we've got a plan we consistently deliver.  We -- in any given period, we can take more gross ad share, but we want to make sure that we're also delivering the industry-leading EBITDA growth, and industry-leading cash flow growth, and we're creating the wherewithal to make this a sustainable journey as we go penetrate all these underpenetrated segments that our competitors don't have. And that takes consistency and reliability rather than chasing that last couple of points of SOGA like the other guys are doing. And we're very pleased with this execution and we think investors ought to be too when. They look at the big picture.\nJonathan Chaplin: Mike, f I can just quickly follow up on that. It also -- you guys have mentioned a couple of times how complex and an enormous the integration process is and how this integration is going far better than any integration of comparable scale ever in the industry at least that we've seen.  When you say that at this point in your journey you're happy with the circle that you've got, is it a function or just all of the complexity that needs to be managed in the business right now. And once you get through the integration, that's the churn benefits on the Sprint side aside, you'll have more management bandwidth and resources to focus on increasing the pace at which you take share. Is that maybe say focusing on [Indiscernible] right now just unfairly given the complexity in the business?\nMichael Sievert: I don't think it's about management bandwidth, but resources are certainly a relevant point. One of the things we're doing, as you see is we're spending heavily into this integration and outpacing our expectations on the timeframes for our costs to achieve plan. So that we can get this integration done more quickly. And we think that's by far the right strategy. The customers get the benefit sooner, the shareholders get the benefits sooner.  Probably the magnitude of the benefits is positively affected by the rate and pace. But during that sausage making, it takes a lot of resources and we want to be able to reliably deliver cash flows to you and down payments as we go along, I think asking the market for a giant leap of trust for us to plow deeply into our cash flow plan in a different way than you expected just because we're ahead on integration, that wouldn't be I think a great trade-off for us to ask investors to ride along with.  So, we're paying for this as we go, and we're delivering the amount of SOGA and investing accordingly in SOGA that allows us to deliver high quality, prime customers that deliver outpacing EBITDA and cash flow growth, even during the height of this integration. Which is something I'm very pleased about.  But to your point, the underlying Magenta business, which is all we're going to have as we get into a major part of '23 is performing beautifully. And it shows you the power of this brand and that the un -carrier is in full force and effect. We are tackling the biggest pain point of all. That trade-off that people have always had to make between quality and price. We're delivering both, and they're noticing like never before. And those trends, I think bond (ph.) very well for us on the back side of this integration.\nPeter Osvaldik: And I would just add, Jonathan --\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys.\nPeter Osvaldik: -- I know you were thinking ahead to what happens post integration. And you've got to remember, we're delivering this SOGA while we're still expanding distribution and building the network around smaller markets in rural area. So, this is the SOGA that we're delivering before we're fully deployed the Un -carrier machine in 40% of the population. And when -- you heard Mike talk about just how differentiated that experience is going to be.  We're bringing everything that made us so successful to date, except doing it with a fully differentiated network experience that is just going to blow the other guy's away in that 100 million covered pops that is going to be a 4G, I don't know 5G experience relative to ultra capacity with T-Mobile, with all of the uncarrier goodness that comes from the last eight years bringing it there. So just that's another area as you look forward, as we bring this machine to that 40% of how it could impact SOGA.\nJonathan Chaplin: That's a great point. Thanks Peter. Thanks, Mike.\nPeter Osvaldik: You bet.\nJud Henry: Let's go to the next question, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you, we'll take our next question from John Hodulik of UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. A couple of quick questions for you. First on cash EBITDA, it has been decelerating for the last few quarters, grew 4.5% this quarter, but the guidance for the year, so there's suggests growth of over 5%. I mean, first of all, is that the way to think of it that this is the bottom in terms of cash EBITDA growth. And then maybe the [Indiscernible] to it because I see him sitting over there by himself.  Do you guys have visibility in terms of the synergies coming through with the sprint network that it's a sort of linear growth from here in terms of the acceleration of cash EBITDA, as you pulled down that Sprint network. That's number one. And then, on fixed wireless, anything else you can tell us about the sub-based, maybe the size of the sub-base, [Indiscernible] -- I think you have that 500,000 subs by year-end target out there or anything about usage or how the networks performing in areas where you guys are selling fixed wireless service. Thanks.\nMichael Sievert: Okay. EBITDA, synergy pacing, and fixed wireless. So, Peter, let's start with you.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. John, I think you're trying to tease out of me '22 core EBITDA. So good job, again. I think you know I'll revert back to all the comments about the business and how I see '22 shaping and the excitement around free cash flow. On the 2021 guide, yeah, you're absolutely right. There was another -- not only synergy increase as a result of the integration, but also the growth from the underlying business that's allowed us to increase yet again for a third quarter in a row, core adjusted EBITDA to between 20.34 and 20.35 billion.  So tremendously excited about how that continues to grow and of course the opportunity and momentum of the business as we look out into the 23 and 26 period of LRP. And maybe I'll hand it over to Neville to talk through decommissioning, but it's not linear in terms of how you achieve the synergies or as we spoken before, how you really achieve and when you record the merger-related cost. But next year is certainly a big year in terms of decommissioning and I'll let Neville talk about that. That sets us up for such a significant portion of the synergies as we decommission the sites. Neville?\nNevilleRay: Thanks, Peter. And I'm not on my own, John, I got hope as a whole team here, we're all in the room --\nJohn Hodulik: It seems like you are a being ignored, [Indiscernible]\nNevilleRay: But very quickly on synergy and the developments and pipeline. We're already well into synergy development in, we made a good start in '20. We're making great progress in '21. As Peter just outlined, '22 is really our biggest year and it's not linear. Our goal is to substantially complete our decommissioning activity across the network inside 2022. So, we've made good progress to-date, but '22 is going to be our big year.  And unrealistically, it won't be linear during the year either, I mean things will certainly pick up and there will be a tail, a positive tail, as we move into the second half, but we're making great progress, and as we've always said, this integration, migration, decommissioning strategy is all based on building the network first and you've heard from almost everybody on the call today, the progress we're making in terms of building the capacity and scale and reach and breadth of this network is just super exciting.  We're ahead of our plan with in an arm's reach of a nationwide mid-band 5G ultra capacity network, really before the other guys, even get started. So, we're in a great place, and to the back half of your question, John, around how we performing in areas where [Indiscernible] was successfully growing in-home broadband products at a great rate. We're doing really well. The growth is strong.  There's huge demand for the product and the capacity that we can generate with this network is just phenomenal. that 200 million people by the end of the year that are covered with ultra capacity, we're targeting 100 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum across that footprint. That's more spectrum on mid-band and AT&T and Verizon will have available from C-band between them both. And so, the capacity and capability that we're generating is truly exciting, and a lot of growth for activism and great growth opportunities, including specifically in-home broadband product you referenced.\nMichael Sievert: Yeah. As for that, we didn't disclose lots of detail. I did tell you that we were running last quarter at twice the pace of Verizon, who had a three-year head start. We launched this out of beta early this year. And as well as this last quarter, the [Indiscernible] team delivered more net new home broadband customers on 5G than Verizon did on fiber and 5G combined.  Which kind of shows you that there's a lot of latent demand out there, and it also shows you the capacity of our 5G network and the kinds of things people are doing on that broadband. Hundreds of gigs a month on that 5G network, and of course we have that footprint now out there pretty widely available. So maybe now you could talk about what kind of feedback we're getting from customers.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, I know, thanks Mike. As Mike mentioned, we're seeing customers. One, we're seeing great uptake with the product. We're seeing customers use the product in several 100 gigs a month we also have many using many more and Neville's network is serving them just fine. We're -- what's great to see too is a lot of third-party recognition from like PC Magazine. And I think it's Readers\u2019 Choice -- Awards. They rated us higher than all the other cable companies and we even this last quarter, we had a record high NPS that we track internally...  Customers seem to be liking this very much and we -- initially we, at the beginning of the year, we said we aspire to be at 500,000 customers by the end of the year, we're well on track to do that. On our way to 7 million to 8 million customers by 2025, which I think we remind everyone that's only a couple of percentage points of the overall industry. This really big opportunity for us is really just a small penetration into the industry and gives us lots of opportunities, so off to a great start. I mean, it's not surprising that there's a lot of delight out there and I hope we can keep that up.  I think we will be able to, it looks like the usage while it rises is not rising as fast as our capacity, but look, we're solving problems for these customers. that's why there's so satisfied, we are either solving the problem of giving them a real viable high-speed choice where there wasn't one, and boy that would -- that change your life, or coming into a place where you're so frustrated by cable, and you want a decent deal and a fair price and a Company that will put you first and treat you right, so you can unplug that code.\nJon Freier: That's a big problem solved to $50.00 for home broadband. The kind of home broadband we have like 5% or 6% of our customers using a terabyte a month. That's solving real problems for people so, not surprisingly, those net promoter scores are high. We're so excited about this business.\nMichael Sievert: Thanks John, let's go back to the Operator and then maybe they want to prepare us 1 more Jud from this big screen of Twitter feed.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have comes from Q - David Barden of Bank of America.\nDavid Barden : Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I guess, the first would be, I think Mike you talked about more than 50% of the customers are taking Magenta MAX at the margin. Obviously, Verizon need a kick through a lot of the opportunity to migrate metered to unlimited. I was wondering if you could share where Magenta MAX stands as a percentage of the base. And relative to the base, what kind of ARPU lift are you getting? And then the second question I have, if I could, is just related to, again, the Sprint network shutdown and its importance to the realization of synergies.  And Mike, some of your comments about how you sat down with all the interested parties related to the network shutdown and decided to extend the deadline to March 31st. In the blog post that went out, you said it would have no financial impact, at least if we went that far. Are we convinced that we're ready to just end this and begin to get the network shutdown and we're comfortable saying March 31st it's the last concession, we're making? Thanks.\nMichael Sievert: Let me start with the second one, Dave, and then we'll talk about Magenta MAX. We just don't see any cause for a further delay. And this getting people upgraded to the right side of the digital dividing, getting a high capacity 4G, 5G network in the hands of people who need it most as urgent it's certainly also important for our business.  And when we look at the run rates of upgrades and we study the run rates and the declining based on CDMA, all the curves pointed they just wouldn't be caused to delay it further. So, I wouldn't expect a further delay for that reason. I certainly wouldn't expect a further delay that would have any impact on our financials our ability to go execute the plan that we promised you, and nor does this one. We looked at it carefully.  We found a way to do this because we wanted to do the right thing for a partner that was asking us, even though we don't feel that they needed it, and we're pleased we were able to do it. And we are pleased we were able to be responsive to our conversations with the Department of Justice to do this on a voluntary basis, so no, we just don't see that there would be cause to delay it further, and then back to Magenta MAX, no, I can't give you too much on the base here, it's all very competitively sensitive. But the premise of your question is really interesting, which is the other guys might be starting to exhaust their opportunities.  Man, we're just getting started. The base, there's lots of room to run in the base and this is the very best expression of the best 5G network in the market. And no wonder, it's popular. When people have been able to get amazing handset deals by signing up for this plan, and that's been a catalyst. They're using 35 gigs a month. What we think is on its way to 80 gigs a month that this network will be able to handle, no problem. And that shows you -- the Magenta MAX experience shows you, as Mike said a little while ago, that the smartphone is the first killer app of 5G.  We see huge usage in video, and social media growth, and mobile hotspot growth. Our Magenta MAX customers don't walk into a building and look around for the Wi - Fi signal and ask you for the Wi - Fi password. They provide the Wi - Fi, and that's where this world's going. So, we're so excited about what we're seeing, but can't really parse it too much other than I agree with the premise of your question which is, do we have room to run on the base here? Yes, we do.\nDavid Barden : Thanks, Mike, really appreciate it.\nPeter Osvaldik: If you put that 35 gigs into context on Magenta MAX, that's three times the industry on what you're seeing in 4G LTE. It's just incredible in terms of the consumption on Magenta MAX when you compare with the industry's best in leading 5G network.  It certainly helps to put cable competition into perspective. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, you see \"unlimited offers\" that throttle you. We're not talking about prioritization if the network is busy, we are talking about you throttled after 20 gigs.  First of all, why are you calling that an unlimited plan. And second of all, that's a 4G plan in a 5G world. And with where we're going, I don't know where they go. I don't think that they're going to be able to have the owner's economics in wireless to truly compete on value on the wireless side. And I don't think that AT&T and Verizon have the wherewithal or the plans to compete with us on the quality of the 5G network that we're building. and so, we really like the hand of cards for that reason strategically.\nDavid Barden : Thank you, guys.\nPeter Osvaldik: Thanks, Dave. Do we want to go one more on the -- did you find?\nJud Henry: Yes, we've got a quick one here from Bill Ho. So, he asked with the recent Best Buy and Walmart distribution relationships, what's the view on these channels driving 4Q '21 and the future years growth relative to the past. John on if you want to hit on that quickly and something announcements recently on that distribution front?\nJon Freier: You bet, we're so excited about this. You made a couple of announcements just in the last 30 days, 45 days or so where we have --\nPeter Osvaldik: we're going to be expanding our T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile products. Not [Indiscernible] we have expanded them into Walmart and across 2,300 stores on Walmart and a lot of those in smaller markets and rural areas, of course. And then also have launched T-Mobile and Best Buy across 900 stores. We're incredibly excited about this. I think when you look at what Walmart has done and what Best Buy has done in the pandemic and how they have completely revolutionized their particular companies. Walmart is the place to go shop in rural America. It is incredible what Walmart has done digital transformation and then when you look at Best Buy as a premier consumer electronics retailer across the U.S, those are attractive opportunities for us.\nPeter Osvaldik: You've got to remember too is that we haven't really played in national retail in these large national retailers in a very long time. As matter of fact, just in the last quarter, we quadrupled with these announcements, our number of national retail locations. So, we see those as big opportunities for our Company to be in the customer basis of Walmart and in Best Buy and see significant switching opportunities in those spaces as well. So, we're very attracted to what Walmart is doing, what Best Buy is doing.  Clearly, they are attracted to the industry's best 5G network and all of the opportunity that our Company represents over the next several years. So, we're very bullish on that. I don't have numbers exactly by channel to give you in Q4 or the years beyond. But I'll just tell you that we're very bullish about these opportunities. We've got great strategic relationships with Walmart and Best Buy, we've been engaged in a lot of conversations over the last several months, and we're very excited about the future and very confident in our approach there.\nMichael Sievert: Well, terrific. I'm going to wrap it up here in a second. First of all, I want to thank you for all these great questions and I know we gave you some long answers and so apologies to the people that might have been in the queue we didn't get to. We are always available to you. I know Jud and team are anxious to talk to you and answer questions in an FD-compliant way, following this meeting. But I really like the kind of questions that we had.  And as you noticed, I prepared my remarks to try to address what I see is some of the big questions out there about our sector and we get a lot of people saying, man, is it getting competitive? What's going on? Are you guys still the growth leader? And the answer to that is an emphatic yes, we like it competitive. We execute incredibly well when it's competitive.  And the question for investors is, who has the situation and the hand of cards and the assets and the team to sustainably deliver in a competitive marketplace with room to run. And that's what we were hoping to address in a high-quality way today, and your questions gave us those opportunities to address some of those topics. So, we appreciate you. Thanks for tuning. And Jud, anything final?\nJud Henry: No. Just again, thank you, everybody for your time. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations or Media Relations and we're happy to follow up. Thank you again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. And I'm not on my own, John, I got hope as a whole team here, we're all in the room -- But very quickly on synergy and the developments and pipeline. We're already well into synergy development in, we made a good start in '20. We're making great progress in '21. As Peter just outlined, '22 is really our biggest year and it's not linear. Our goal is to substantially complete our decommissioning activity across the network inside 2022. So, we've made good progress to-date, but '22 is going to be our big year.  And unrealistically, it won't be linear during the year either, I mean things will certainly pick up and there will be a tail, a positive tail, as we move into the second half, but we're making great progress, and as we've always said, this integration, migration, decommissioning strategy is all based on building the network first and you've heard from almost everybody on the call today, the progress we're making in terms of building the capacity and scale and reach and breadth of this network is just super exciting.  We're ahead of our plan with in an arm's reach of a nationwide mid-band 5G ultra capacity network, really before the other guys, even get started. So, we're in a great place, and to the back half of your question, John, around how we performing in areas where [Indiscernible] was successfully growing in-home broadband products at a great rate. We're doing really well. The growth is strong.  There's huge demand for the product and the capacity that we can generate with this network is just phenomenal. that 200 million people by the end of the year that are covered with ultra capacity, we're targeting 100 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum across that footprint. That's more spectrum on mid-band and AT&T and Verizon will have available from C-band between them both. And so, the capacity and capability that we're generating is truly exciting, and a lot of growth for activism and great growth opportunities, including specifically in-home broadband product you referenced."

            "name": "Michael Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody, it's so great to be here to share this quarter's results with you, and as you might have noticed, we are entering the home stretch for 2021, and our team, is feeling more confident than ever. We've exceeded not only Wall Street expectations, but even our own targets at this stage of our integration journey in terms of customer growth, profitability, and synergies. And with that success, we are once again increasing our guidance expectations, across the board today.  The un -carrier is about solving pain points. And you may remember that when we closed our merger last year, we said that our combined assets meant that we would end the biggest pain point of all, that age-old problem of having to choose between the best network and the best value. We said we'd be in a unique position as the new un -carrier, with our unique assets and financial position in the 5G era to end that trade-off and deliver both.  Well, let me tell you, this differentiated playbook that has never been done before in wireless is already contributing to our results, and creating market-leading profitable growth where it counts in top-line postpaid customers and revenues, and in cash flows at the bottom line. Only T-Mobile provides the best value proposition, with truly unlimited plans, fairly priced on the best 5G network and with award-winning service.  This combination is differentiating our model from the other guys and uniquely positioning T-Mobile in significant ways that have long-term implications. In Q3, we led the industry in postpaid net adds and postpaid service revenue growth. Again, just as we've done every quarter since we closed the merger, we also led the industry in core EBITDA growth and free cash flow growth.  Let's talk about a few of the highlights that are driving all of this growth. Smaller markets and rural areas are already contributing about one-third of our new accounts, and brand equities are up across the board. And we're still in the very early innings of our distribution expansion and ultra-capacity build-out in smaller markets. In enterprise, we delivered our highest ever gross adds and net adds because organizations really understand our 5G leadership better than anyone.  For 5G high-speed Internet, we delivered our highest-ever net adds in Q3, more than Tableau (ph) Verizon, and two-thirds of our net adds came from urban and suburban markets. In other words, cable territory. All right. Coming back to my point on how T-Mobile is uniquely positioned in our industry, I understand that many of you have raised questions about the promotional environment and also about the source and sustainability of recent industry growth. And some have actually question whether 5G really matters to consumers.  While I do believe this is a healthy and growing industry, I understand that the actions of some of our peers may have soured sentiment on our category for some. So today, I'm purposely focused on addressing these perceptions head-on and sharing my view of how our approach and competitive position is differentiated, both for customers and for T-Mobile's business. The first question I'm sure it's top of mind, is the promotional intensity in this industry. Listen, as I've said before, at T-Mobile, we actually like healthy competition. Because we historically win, when customers start shopping around, our competitors are leaning into device offers. And while I can't really explain what they're up to, I can't imagine it's out of abject fear that were coming to take all their customers, because they don't have compelling pricing or a competitive 5G network or significant under-penetrated growth factors like T-Mobile has, so they are trying to temporarily buy-down churn while they sell off assets and come up with a plan. In contrast, our competitive push into device offers is strategic. Listen, we have a once in a decade opportunity to leap ahead and stay ahead of everyone else as customers embrace 5G.  We're years ahead on 5G, as you know, and we're positioned to stay ahead. And we're, therefore, incented to get people on 5G so they can experience that advantage. Every time we upgrade a customer from 4G to 5G, we take them from a device that works similarly on all three big networks, to a device that works way, way better at T-Mobile.  And secondly, we are laser-focused on completing our merger integration ahead of schedule. This is huge because of the significant churn opportunity that we have, which is why we're putting device offers in place to bring Sprint customers to T-Mobile as quickly as possible. And unlike some, we generally pay for all of this in our P&L as we go along. Meanwhile, AT&T and Verizon are running expensive promotions to put 5G devices in their customers' hands even though they are unlikely to find a much faster 5G signal or notice a difference in speeds most of the time.  In fact, every time they upgrade a customer from a 4G device to a 5G device, they're playing right into our strength and spending a fortune to do it. And in AT&T 's case, racking up billions of dollars of future impacts on their Balance Sheet. How do their customers feel when they take that shiny new 5G phone home, only to realize that most of the time it works just like their 4G phone. At T-Mobile, those devices work demonstrably better, with ultra capacity 5G reaching more than half the country today, rocking speeds of 400 megabits per second on average. Every one of those competitive customers being upgraded to 5G, at great expense, is a potential future T-Mobile customer. The second question is around the source and sustainability of recent customer growth in the industry. This one would be easier to answer if everyone in our industry was as transparent as T-Mobile such as disclosing accounts or what adjustments are being made, etc.  What I do know is that T-Mobile has a diversified growth opportunity in underpenetrated and new markets that's unmatched in this industry. One way to cut to the chase is to look at accounts instead of lines. Our postpaid net new accounts in Q3 doubled year-over-year with our highest Q3 account growth in 7 years, even while in the thick of our integration. We're up more than 1 million net new accounts year-over-year.  We did this while Verizon had no account growth year-over-year, and AT&T didn't disclose accounts. And what's more, we see significant opportunities ahead, in smaller markets and rural areas. We're leading America into the 5G era, as we march toward covering 300 million people, with ultra capacity 5G by the end of 2023, a time by which others only aspire to cover a 175 million to 200 million people. The difference in geographic coverage between 200 million and 300 million people is huge, roughly 5 times the land area, giving us a big competitive advantage in smaller markets and rural areas. Listen, as the Un -carrier in smaller markets, we are combining a suddenly much stronger network with disruptive value and the best customer service. Does that sound familiar? It should. Newly competitive network combined with disruptive value and customer experience. That's exactly the Un -carrier playbook we ran over the last few years in the tab markets. We're bringing the same playbook to smaller markets and rural areas that took us from number 4 to number 1 in the major metros, except in the smaller markets, we're not just bringing a competitive network.  Our goal is to bring a superior one, anchored by our advantage in 5G. And let's not forget that in major markets, we have room to run. We're not just defending our castle. We got to our current leadership position without being perceived as having a network advantage. Now, we have the opportunity to appeal to millions more customers in the larger markets as well, who shop primarily on network, reach, speed, and capacity. In enterprise and government markets, another big opportunity where our 5G leadership has already opening new doors.  We've already seen an increase in our win share for traditional postpaid services, and we're well-positioned to capture advanced 5G services with the widest built-out 5G network and the only standalone 5G core, which is exactly why many large enterprises are in active trials with T-Mobile for advanced capabilities like mobile edge compute and private networks. And let me remind you, that these advanced 5G services represent upside to our plan. Bottom line, our competitors are broadly distributed today. They're already in smaller markets in rural areas and they already have outsized share in enterprise.  And they're overpriced with little 5G to show for it, making it tough for them to defend their flanks when we come in with a better network and a better value. I say all this, not to bash anybody, but to make it clear that as competition heats up, you shouldn't paint us all with the same brush. T-Mobile is executing and demonstrating that these profitable growth opportunities are real and they are differentiated. As part of that industry growth debate, I hear misperceptions out there that T-Mobile's growth has slowed relative to our pre -merger momentum.  And I'd love to set the record straight on this one. What we look out proudly is our Magenta performance as a signal of our future success. We delivered our highest ever postpaid phone net adds on the Magenta brand, year-to-date through Q3. Our highest ever in Company history happening now. This year, even after normalizing for Sprint transfers into Magenta, the uncarrier strategy is in full force and we're competing smartly, and the result is high quality, profitable, industry-leading growth.  With our Magenta business firing on all cylinders, we're also working rapidly through the integration of the higher churning Sprint base. Just to put this in perspective, if the Sprint base had the same churn as our Magenta base, our phone net adds in Q3 would've been about 1.2 million way ahead of anyone else in the industry. That shows you the potential future tailwind to our growth engine as we work to get Sprint churn down to Magenta churn levels. And it reinforces that our gross adds flows are right where we want them to be, at least for this point in our journey.  While others are temporarily benefiting from elevated Sprint churn today, we're working to make that very short-lived. With over 1/2 of Sprint customers, at least partly migrated, we continue to execute our playbook to finish the integration in a compressed time frame. Which does have temporary impacts, but brings forward the time frames when both the customer experience and our business results, have the benefit of integration being behind us. I'm so proud of how the team is executing to get all this done way ahead of schedule. And we're particularly encouraged by what we see from Sprint customers, that have made the full migration to the T-Mobile value proposition.  As they already have churn on par with Magenta customers. Changing gears. I've seen some media articles and analysts notes commenting on how consumers should be indifferent between 5G and 4G, given the limited availability and similar performance. While they're absolutely right when they look at AT&T and Verizon. Those companies have much more geographically distributed customer bases and only a small percentage of their customers are seeing big benefits from 5G, and nor are a high percentage of them likely to see a benefit from their early C-band deployments.  At T-Mobile, 5G is a distinct differentiator. Here's a fun fact for you, over 75% of T-Mobile 5G customers are within our ultracapaciy 5G coverage area that now reaches 190 people. Well, over half of the country, enjoying blazing fast speeds of around 10 times faster than 4G. Ask AT&T and Verizon what percentage of their customer bases are in the footprint of their fastest 5G. And at T-Mobile -- and T-Mobile's 5G leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. We see this demonstrated in several areas.  The first area where we see our network leadership resonating is in perception metrics among non-customers, or in other words, potential future customers. According to our pulling, perception for overall network reliability has increased over 20% year-over-year and is now higher than AT&T. Our recognition as the 5G leader among potential customers has increased over 80% from a year ago. 80%, matching Verizon, while Verizon scores are flat to down, and we scored three times higher than AT&T. Potential customers are taking notice of our lead.  The second aspect is the adoption of Magenta MAX, the best plan on the best 5G network. Take rates continue to exceed our expectations, and we now see more of that half of new customers choosing MAX. The engagement that we have seen just reinforces our belief that the 5G smartphone is the first killer app of the 5G era. From video calling, which has taken off as a primary means of communication, to TikTok and mixed reality and emerging metaverse applications, T-Mobile's network is unlocking a differentiated smartphone experience in this industry today.  We see this not only in the take rates that I mentioned, but also in the way that customers are taking advantage of this differentiated experience using 35 gigabytes a month on average when pairing Magenta MAX with a 5G smartphone. 35 gigs a month all ready, that's roughly tripled the average 4G usage in the industry and an experience that AT&T and Verizon will be hard pressed to support from a capacity perspective. And did you see those new offers from the cable guys? Cable is constructing 4G offers in a 5G world, and they will be challenged without wireless owner's economics.  Never mind the fact that they are on the smallest 5G network, Verizon. They already automatically throttle anyone using more than 20 gigs and they are quite limited, so-called unlimited plan today. That might barely cut it with some consumers for a very short time, but not where this industry is quickly going. And the final question I want to address is around the quality of earnings in this industry. Sure, there are geography differences and some maybe aren't reflecting the full magnitude of their promotional spending in their EBITDA. at the end of the day cash is key.  And real value creation should be measured by the conversion of service revenues into free cash flow. T-Mobile has unmatched potential, because of our industry-leading growth and synergy back to model. And we've guided to deliver a significant CAGR of 45% from 2021 to 2024. From our perspective, the current market valuation of our Company based on our guided free cash flow, would suggest that there is significant potential shareholder value not yet reflected.  Before I wrap up, I do want to comment on the cyber-attack we experienced last quarter. As we previously reported and updated in our filings today, we promptly located and closed to the unauthorized access to our systems after becoming aware of this criminal cyber-attack against T-Mobile and our customers. And we conducted a forensic investigation, with the assistance of world leading cybersecurity experts.  That's now complete. We also undertook extensive efforts to support and protect our customers and to further enhance our cybersecurity practices throughout this process. Protecting our customer's data is a top priority for the Company, which is why we've taken a number of steps to respond to this incident. And I've created a Cyber Transformation Office, reporting directly to me, elevating our cybersecurity team in this work accordingly. We're further building a security forward mindset into our work and our culture, and we're partnering with the best and the brightest like Mandiant and KPMG to help us do it right.  Now, before I turn it over to Peter to take us through a few financial highlights and our outstanding guidance, I want to express how proud I am of this team. We executed another terrific quarter leading the industry and postpaid customer growth while delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid subscribers. postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. All while further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. Overall, our strategy is absolutely working and we clearly have the best hand of cards to win in the years ahead. All right, Peter, over to you. Hi, Phil. Thanks, Phil. I'll start with the first one, and maybe hand it to Peter and he'll go ahead and guide you on '22, three months in advance. On CDMA, yeah, I think most of what we had to say was in our disclosure at the time. We've been in talks with all the other parties involved, including the Department of Justice. And following those talks, we just decided to take upon ourselves to voluntarily move that date out by 3 months and plan to sunset the CDMA network at the end of March.  And we did that after carefully looking at our own plans and determining that there wouldn't be a material impact from doing that to our outlook or our financials, our ability to deliver use synergies as expected. But we did want to make sure that everyone involved had the time that they needed to make sure that we meet the Department of Justice.  What I know is, is there's a goal in the public interest, which is to make sure that every single customer out there has the opportunity and is given the opportunity to switch to the superior network in time. Now, as we've said all along, we believe that December 31 provides that ample time, and we've given everybody involved well over a year way more notice than they needed. But when we look at the actual run rates, it looked to us like even at the current rates, an extra 3 months would be something that everyone would appreciate.  And so, I'd like our partners to be moving faster, they don't appear to be, and because we just took that voluntary action on our own. And we think this is based on everything we're seeing, we think this is all that would be necessary, and so that's something that we we're pleased to be able to do. As it relates to all the pros and cons and effects on EBITDA for next year, we're looking forward to an exciting '22, but I doubt Peter will give you a much on it, but I'd hand to my friend Peter. Terrific. I'll start with the second one and then maybe hand it to Peter on the first one, and I'll ask Jon if he has anything to add on the first one. On Sprint churn, listen we're really pleased with what we're seeing, but you have to bear in mind that what we're doing in this strategy is we're compressing integration into a tighter time frame, and that means that whatever Sprint churn is going to happen as a function of integration is going to happen in a shorter period of time and affect the integration periods to a greater extent. And our Sprint customers are showing us a tremendous number of patients as we give them a much better 5G network experience and get them migrated over. But still as anybody who follows this industry knows, when you have an integration during that period of integration, there can be puts and takes for customers. And we're trying to do our best to give every customer a great experience. As it relates to what we're seeing, when somebody comes across from Sprint to Magenta in what we call a full migration, and there aren't that many that have a full migration yet. So, there could be some selection bias here.  That means you're fully on the T-Mobile network. You're fully on the T-Mobile biller. You're engaged with the T-Mobile brand. You've moved to T-Mobile tax inclusive rate plans and you're experiencing T-Mobile team of expert service. So, where we're going? Where we're going very quickly for everyone. Those customers that have come all the way across are showing so far this about the same churn profile as Magenta customers, and that's very exciting because Magenta is on par with anybody out there and many time periods has been the best in the industry. So that's really promising.  Now, I think while we have the opportunity because we're compressing the time frames and we're only seeing somewhat elevated churn to actually come through this integration with less overall losses than we would have expected from the Sprint side, because it's happening during a compressed time frame. We are very pleased with those trends and we're -- you'll see us in our actions with things like our Sprint forward initiative and things like our device offers moving to get Sprint customers the handsets they need, particularly 600 megahertz compatible handsets, as well as everything else they need to take full advantage of their Magenta network.  And before we go on to ARPU, I know John, if you'd like to add anything to what you're seeing and what your team is seeing with Sprint customers because it's one of the most important questions I think we'll talk about today. Because as you saw, the underlying Magenta performance is unbelievably great and we just have to get through the synergy. What are you seeing, John? Terrific, well I'll start with the first one. I don't think we have all the answers as to what's driving account growth or line growth over at all of our competitors and you don't see quite the same amount of transparency. It's one of the reasons why we decided to start talking much more about accounts and about ARPA because there's no ambiguity in that. Our 268,000 net new accounts relationships on the postpaid side was the largest in 7 years for a Q3.  And you see ARPA rising and so it shows you the quality of that business. One of the things we didn't talk about is that our prime percentage is up several points from a year ago. I mean we're getting more and more prime, not surprisingly, because we have a better and better network. So, attract -- where it's starting to attract to higher levels the best customers in the industry.  And so, for us, it's not some of the things that you might expect. It's not EBB because we have no material EBB in our numbers. Generally, that program is over on our lifelines side, which isn't in our subscriber goals, but is for our competitors in to a certain extent. It's not due to subprime, it might be for our competitors, but our prime mix continues to improve.  It's not due to some weirdness of lines underneath the accounts because you see account growth and ARPA growth, very healthy. And you see that flowing through to industry-leading postpaid EBITDA growth, as well as industry-leading cash flow growth. And so, look, I don't know how sustainable it is. Prepaid is about flat, so there's certainly been some amount of transference there from what you would've expected to be an organic rate.  I don't know how sustainable it is. But what investors should ask themselves is if it doesn't become sustainable, who's going to win? and who has a reliable ongoing strategy that will be able to deliver growth in all the different time periods? And look, for us, we have a strategy and a set of assets. It's going after majorly under-penetrated segments, like small markets in rural areas which are 40% of the country. Like enterprise, like home broadband, your second question. These are huge places where we don't play and the other guys do.  And so that -- between that and our massive lead in 5G, we're 2 years ahead on the 5G race and I'm here to tell you that in 2 years from now we'll be 2 years or more ahead in the 5G race. And that's going to translate as well to opportunity for us. And so, look, I think there is some amount of temporary that's happening with the other guys. They're feeding to a small extent on our integration driven Sprint churn, investors will have to ask themselves whether you believe that's going to be very short-lived and not only not be a tailwind for them anymore, but will turn around.  We'll see how that goes, but we're really pleased with where things are going and what's the underlying trends. Now your second question is about convergence and about home broadband. First, I want to talk about how we're doing as being a multi category player with our push into home broadband and then maybe we can talk about the question on fiber, etc. Perfect. Okay. Well, let's go -- Jud, let's see what's on Twitter and then we'll come back to the phones after that. Let's go right to my [Indiscernible] Yes, one of the things that we've talked about, and I think you heard in Peter's earlier remarks, is that after listen, we did see to the first question and impact from the data breach that happened in August, and there was a muted effect there because of that, I was quoted early in the Fourth Quarter saying that we finished much stronger and we were seeing nice trends as we entered the Fourth Quarter. And that shows that this was while a big event and something were very-very sorry happened. Something that customers have generally prepared themselves to move on from. And so that's good.  On the other hand, look, our model, one of the things I pointed out was that if you were to normalize our churn and look at what it may look like after we are finished with this integration. And just for a minute, I don't know if it will look like this, but just for a minute to say, what if all of our churn was at the Magenta levels. Our net adds this quarter, with that SOGA figure you talked about, would've been 1.2 million on the postpaid phones side. By far the biggest in the category and outsized versus time periods in our history as well.  And it really shows you that SOGA level that we're getting is reliable, sustainable, and about where we want it for this point in our journey. What you don't see us doing, Jonathan, that you may see elsewhere is kind of knee-jerk reactions and lurches into unanticipated, very expensive promotions, etc. etc. With no strategic apparent linkage behind it. And we've got a plan we consistently deliver.  We -- in any given period, we can take more gross ad share, but we want to make sure that we're also delivering the industry-leading EBITDA growth, and industry-leading cash flow growth, and we're creating the wherewithal to make this a sustainable journey as we go penetrate all these underpenetrated segments that our competitors don't have. And that takes consistency and reliability rather than chasing that last couple of points of SOGA like the other guys are doing. And we're very pleased with this execution and we think investors ought to be too when. They look at the big picture. I don't think it's about management bandwidth, but resources are certainly a relevant point. One of the things we're doing, as you see is we're spending heavily into this integration and outpacing our expectations on the timeframes for our costs to achieve plan. So that we can get this integration done more quickly. And we think that's by far the right strategy. The customers get the benefit sooner, the shareholders get the benefits sooner.  Probably the magnitude of the benefits is positively affected by the rate and pace. But during that sausage making, it takes a lot of resources and we want to be able to reliably deliver cash flows to you and down payments as we go along, I think asking the market for a giant leap of trust for us to plow deeply into our cash flow plan in a different way than you expected just because we're ahead on integration, that wouldn't be I think a great trade-off for us to ask investors to ride along with.  So, we're paying for this as we go, and we're delivering the amount of SOGA and investing accordingly in SOGA that allows us to deliver high quality, prime customers that deliver outpacing EBITDA and cash flow growth, even during the height of this integration. Which is something I'm very pleased about.  But to your point, the underlying Magenta business, which is all we're going to have as we get into a major part of '23 is performing beautifully. And it shows you the power of this brand and that the un -carrier is in full force and effect. We are tackling the biggest pain point of all. That trade-off that people have always had to make between quality and price. We're delivering both, and they're noticing like never before. And those trends, I think bond (ph.) very well for us on the back side of this integration. Okay. EBITDA, synergy pacing, and fixed wireless. So, Peter, let's start with you. Yeah. As for that, we didn't disclose lots of detail. I did tell you that we were running last quarter at twice the pace of Verizon, who had a three-year head start. We launched this out of beta early this year. And as well as this last quarter, the [Indiscernible] team delivered more net new home broadband customers on 5G than Verizon did on fiber and 5G combined.  Which kind of shows you that there's a lot of latent demand out there, and it also shows you the capacity of our 5G network and the kinds of things people are doing on that broadband. Hundreds of gigs a month on that 5G network, and of course we have that footprint now out there pretty widely available. So maybe now you could talk about what kind of feedback we're getting from customers. Thanks John, let's go back to the Operator and then maybe they want to prepare us 1 more Jud from this big screen of Twitter feed. Let me start with the second one, Dave, and then we'll talk about Magenta MAX. We just don't see any cause for a further delay. And this getting people upgraded to the right side of the digital dividing, getting a high capacity 4G, 5G network in the hands of people who need it most as urgent it's certainly also important for our business.  And when we look at the run rates of upgrades and we study the run rates and the declining based on CDMA, all the curves pointed they just wouldn't be caused to delay it further. So, I wouldn't expect a further delay for that reason. I certainly wouldn't expect a further delay that would have any impact on our financials our ability to go execute the plan that we promised you, and nor does this one. We looked at it carefully.  We found a way to do this because we wanted to do the right thing for a partner that was asking us, even though we don't feel that they needed it, and we're pleased we were able to do it. And we are pleased we were able to be responsive to our conversations with the Department of Justice to do this on a voluntary basis, so no, we just don't see that there would be cause to delay it further, and then back to Magenta MAX, no, I can't give you too much on the base here, it's all very competitively sensitive. But the premise of your question is really interesting, which is the other guys might be starting to exhaust their opportunities.  Man, we're just getting started. The base, there's lots of room to run in the base and this is the very best expression of the best 5G network in the market. And no wonder, it's popular. When people have been able to get amazing handset deals by signing up for this plan, and that's been a catalyst. They're using 35 gigs a month. What we think is on its way to 80 gigs a month that this network will be able to handle, no problem. And that shows you -- the Magenta MAX experience shows you, as Mike said a little while ago, that the smartphone is the first killer app of 5G.  We see huge usage in video, and social media growth, and mobile hotspot growth. Our Magenta MAX customers don't walk into a building and look around for the Wi - Fi signal and ask you for the Wi - Fi password. They provide the Wi - Fi, and that's where this world's going. So, we're so excited about what we're seeing, but can't really parse it too much other than I agree with the premise of your question which is, do we have room to run on the base here? Yes, we do. Well, terrific. I'm going to wrap it up here in a second. First of all, I want to thank you for all these great questions and I know we gave you some long answers and so apologies to the people that might have been in the queue we didn't get to. We are always available to you. I know Jud and team are anxious to talk to you and answer questions in an FD-compliant way, following this meeting. But I really like the kind of questions that we had.  And as you noticed, I prepared my remarks to try to address what I see is some of the big questions out there about our sector and we get a lot of people saying, man, is it getting competitive? What's going on? Are you guys still the growth leader? And the answer to that is an emphatic yes, we like it competitive. We execute incredibly well when it's competitive.  And the question for investors is, who has the situation and the hand of cards and the assets and the team to sustainably deliver in a competitive marketplace with room to run. And that's what we were hoping to address in a high-quality way today, and your questions gave us those opportunities to address some of those topics. So, we appreciate you. Thanks for tuning. And Jud, anything final?"

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered strong results yet again in Q3 as we executed our winning playbook and exceeded expectations across the board. Let's start by talking about growth, where we doubled our postpaid account net adds from a year ago, adding 268,000. And as Mike mentioned, that is the highest account net adds for Q3 in 7 years.  We also delivered industry-leading postpaid net adds of 1.3 million including 673,000 postpaid phone net adds. This growth contributed to our record service revenue, including industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 6% year-over-year.  And we were the only national provider to grow margins year-over-year. We delivered record high core adjusted EBITDA and our Forex increase on free cash flow from a year ago is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey, and the unlocking of significant shareholder value. I'm also extremely proud of the team as we continue to work with the rating agencies.  And in August, all 3 agencies upgraded us based on the Company's continued strong financial results and momentum with Fitch moving to an investment-grade corporate family rating. These upgrades will provide us with significant incremental flexibility to further optimize our capital structure. Let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beaten raise quarter.  We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.1 and 5.3 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities, from increased switching activity expected in Q4. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23.4 and $23.5 billion. Primarily driven by service revenue growth and higher merger synergies, which are now expected to be between $3.2 billion, as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization.  We expect merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between 2.8% and $3 billion before taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities including merger payments is now expected to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.0 billion. We expect cash capex to be between $12.1 billion and $12.3 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration.  Together, this results in a free cash flow including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to between $5.5 billion and $5.6 billion and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. Our Q3 effective tax rate was materially below our prior 2021 guide of 24% to 26% primarily due to state tax benefits associated with certain legal entity reorganizations. We expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% and 22% in Q4, which would put us at about a 15% to 17% rate for the full year.  One last guidance item that I'll note is that we now expect full-year postpaid phone ARPU to be relatively flat to the 47, 74 full-year rate in 2020. This is driven by the fact that Q4 ARPU is trending flat to Q3 as a result of benefits from continued Magenta MAX adoption amongst our customers and converting device insurance products for our Sprint customers to the equivalent Magenta products, which have higher revenue recorded and higher EBITDA contribution. Both of which are expected to offset the typical seasonal promotional ARPU impact in Q4.  And we expect full-year ARPA to be up more than $2 from last year, driven by our strategy to continuously expand our revenue within our account relationships. Before I wrap up, I'd like to come back to Mike's points on addressing questions out there. Some have questioned the real drivers of service revenue growth in the industry, which for some has been supported by grossing up third-party content and cable MVNO growth. At T-Mobile, our growth is primarily driven by our retail business, as evidenced by an industry bet, 6% growth in postpaid service revenue. And our content costs are treated as contra revenue. That's a reduction to our ARPU.  And 1 final point around the quality of earnings in the industry. Several analysts have written about how AT&T has rung up over $4 billion of promotions on their Balance Sheet, and how pressure their ARPU and margins for years to come. However, I think the industry has been unfairly painted with a broad brush based on the actions of one player. At T-Mobile, we take most of our promotional expenses upfront with only a minimal amount amortized through the balance sheet. No point in kicking the can on expenses when you are a sustainable growth Company.  Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A. Jud? Yeah. Phil, we'll certainly provide a full update and guide you as part of our year-end call. But let me give you a couple of points around how we think about '22. First, I know there's been questions around what's the potential impact of DISH, and I think we highlighted it well at our Q2 earnings call. DISH revenue is already under $2 billion in '21. And as we look about how the business momentum is continuing, we said that was always part of the plan.  Again, we took DISH on their word and always assumed that they would become a full facilities player, and during the duration of the LRP, that revenue would go away, and you heard us recommit and we're doing it again today around the \u201823 and the '26 service revenue guidance, given the underlying strength for the business. And so, that is probably the area where I'm most excited. I mean, you saw the results today, you've seen the net account additions and the real growth around not just postpaid phone but postpaid other.  One of the areas of the business that I would like to highlight for '22 is probably ARPU, and with the momentum that we've seen in our updated guide just now to be relatively flat full-year '21 to full-year '22, I see a path with Magenta MAX and the excitement there from our customer base to be less than 1% dilution in '22. And remember, that's off of a higher base in 2021, which is now going to be flat to 2020. The other area, I'd say is really where we're excited is free cash flow.  And you see what's happening are continually raising our guide this year as you look into the 10-Q you also see it's allowed us to take opportunity and do significant prepayments with certain vendors and generate flexibility and savings. And that working capital is already fully contemplated in our updated guide today. So, as we think about '22, I'm very excited about the opportunity for free cash flow. And as Mike said, that really is the ultimate expression of value creation in how you take that service revenue and translate it into cash flow. Absolutely. Brett. Let me -- as you know, right? Underpinned assumption under the LRP was 1% dilution year-over-year through the end of 2023 because the plan was really always focused on how do you get account growth and how do you expand those relationships and have ARPA growth. So, as we look forward to next year, there's a number of things that could impact, and certainly we talked about the great momentum from Magenta MAX and other value-add services that will be a tailwind to ARPU.  But as you think about some of the growth opportunity areas for you, and I'll give you one example which would be large enterprise in government, where our actual phone ARPU maybe lower than our blended base, and so you're going into a new account relationship and enterprise or government where that might be ARPU dilutive, but certainly a very strong ARPA type of relationship.  And typically, you also see a lot of the postpaid other, the other connected devices where in many cases, the CLV amongst those are much stronger than the phone business in and of itself. So that's one area where you could see ARPU dilution and yet tremendously value accretive to T-Mobile from a whole account relationship. So, I'm not going to give you all the puts and takes. You got to let you leave me something to guide you on at year-end earnings instead of Q3. But certainly, great momentum and again, focused on ARPA expansion throughout the course of this plan. So, question on convergence is, we'll have to see. But one thing we do know is that consumers are beginning to realize that there are choices. And they aren't having to put up with what they get today. What we're seeing is that while there are a lot of places, there are very limited choices in terms of what their cable or fiber offering are, and those offerings are typically very punitive.  They start out with promotions, they explode those, they end up paying very, very high prices, fees for modems, the other taxes, other charges that customers don't like. What's translating for us in that is that we're seeing customers, the majority of our customers, are not only coming as Mike mentioned, from urban and suburban areas, but they're also coming from cable and fiber providers.  And why is that? Well, a big part of that is customers want a good product and a great price, and that's what they're getting with our products. And so, we're seeing people come in and say, this is a product that actually works. And you know what, I'm paying an amount that doesn't explode, I'm paying a very fair amount, and I don't have to be extremely irritated about having my existing cable companies gouge me on these things.  And so, for us, this has resulted in what we've seen is our highest net add quarter since we launched the product. And we see continued momentum from people coming from cable fiber. And quite frankly, even other sources, DSL, satellite, etc., and rural markets. So as our 5G ultra capacity network gets built, more and more, we're going to continue to follow that and begin giving more and more customers choice. We're still very excited about this product. Yeah. Perfect. Well, as Mike talked about the beginning, let's not forget that the first big 5 -- killer 5G use case is core connectivity, smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices, and I'm really proud to say that we have seen our win rate continue to improve in that area, and our win rate is trending well above what our market share is, and continuing to improve like we saw in Q3.  And that's resulting in huge growth. If you just look at what's happened over the course of the last 2 years from 2020 to now, our growth in core connectivity is more than 50% better than Verizon 's. in the business space. So, we're seeing that the correlation of us as T-Mobile emerging as the 5G leader correlate with this big growth in core connectivity in business. But your question around these additional 5G use cases.  One of the things that we talked a little bit about in last earnings is we're involved in multiple trials with enterprise and government customers. And we think we're really well-positioned to bring these new enterprise advanced network services to market because of the way that we've delivered our 5G network. Mike has talked a lot about the scale of our network covering a 190 million people with our ultra -- our mid-band 5G network.  But we also have some other key features that we've built our 5G network around that are really positioning us well to differentiate on these 5G use cases, like the fact that we've got a dedicated 5G network core. So, our 5G traffic isn't running through our 4G network first. It's -- we have a dedicated network core that's delivering better performance for customer and customer applications. And also gives us the ability to bring really cool features to market like network slicing that we think is going to be a big opportunity for us with enterprise and government customers in the future.  We have a highly distributed network of data centers so we can help customers process data closer to their application on average than our competitors can. And so, we've got a number of these trials going with customers right now. And these are big, even though you don't see us doing press releases every single week about this, we have big customers with big significant use cases like for instance, we're working with one of the largest airlines in America right now on a mobile edge use-case application that allows them to process data faster, under-weighing, and improve their on-ground operations at one of their major hubs.  We're working with one of the largest U.S auto OEMs to help support a bunch of self-driving use cases and autonomous fleet that they're building. So, we're working with some of the biggest companies in the world helping co-innovate these solutions with them. And we think we're really well positioned because of the engineering decisions that Neville, and his team made to differentiate on these advanced 5G network use cases for our enterprise and business customers going forward. And I would just add, Jonathan -- -- I know you were thinking ahead to what happens post integration. And you've got to remember, we're delivering this SOGA while we're still expanding distribution and building the network around smaller markets in rural area. So, this is the SOGA that we're delivering before we're fully deployed the Un -carrier machine in 40% of the population. And when -- you heard Mike talk about just how differentiated that experience is going to be.  We're bringing everything that made us so successful to date, except doing it with a fully differentiated network experience that is just going to blow the other guy's away in that 100 million covered pops that is going to be a 4G, I don't know 5G experience relative to ultra capacity with T-Mobile, with all of the uncarrier goodness that comes from the last eight years bringing it there. So just that's another area as you look forward, as we bring this machine to that 40% of how it could impact SOGA. You bet. Yeah. John, I think you're trying to tease out of me '22 core EBITDA. So good job, again. I think you know I'll revert back to all the comments about the business and how I see '22 shaping and the excitement around free cash flow. On the 2021 guide, yeah, you're absolutely right. There was another -- not only synergy increase as a result of the integration, but also the growth from the underlying business that's allowed us to increase yet again for a third quarter in a row, core adjusted EBITDA to between 20.34 and 20.35 billion.  So tremendously excited about how that continues to grow and of course the opportunity and momentum of the business as we look out into the 23 and 26 period of LRP. And maybe I'll hand it over to Neville to talk through decommissioning, but it's not linear in terms of how you achieve the synergies or as we spoken before, how you really achieve and when you record the merger-related cost. But next year is certainly a big year in terms of decommissioning and I'll let Neville talk about that. That sets us up for such a significant portion of the synergies as we decommission the sites. Neville? Yes, I know, thanks Mike. As Mike mentioned, we're seeing customers. One, we're seeing great uptake with the product. We're seeing customers use the product in several 100 gigs a month we also have many using many more and Neville's network is serving them just fine. We're -- what's great to see too is a lot of third-party recognition from like PC Magazine. And I think it's Readers' Choice -- Awards. They rated us higher than all the other cable companies and we even this last quarter, we had a record high NPS that we track internally...  Customers seem to be liking this very much and we -- initially we, at the beginning of the year, we said we aspire to be at 500,000 customers by the end of the year, we're well on track to do that. On our way to 7 million to 8 million customers by 2025, which I think we remind everyone that's only a couple of percentage points of the overall industry. This really big opportunity for us is really just a small penetration into the industry and gives us lots of opportunities, so off to a great start. I mean, it's not surprising that there's a lot of delight out there and I hope we can keep that up.  I think we will be able to, it looks like the usage while it rises is not rising as fast as our capacity, but look, we're solving problems for these customers. that's why there's so satisfied, we are either solving the problem of giving them a real viable high-speed choice where there wasn't one, and boy that would -- that change your life, or coming into a place where you're so frustrated by cable, and you want a decent deal and a fair price and a Company that will put you first and treat you right, so you can unplug that code. If you put that 35 gigs into context on Magenta MAX, that's three times the industry on what you're seeing in 4G LTE. It's just incredible in terms of the consumption on Magenta MAX when you compare with the industry's best in leading 5G network.  It certainly helps to put cable competition into perspective. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, you see \"unlimited offers\" that throttle you. We're not talking about prioritization if the network is busy, we are talking about you throttled after 20 gigs.  First of all, why are you calling that an unlimited plan. And second of all, that's a 4G plan in a 5G world. And with where we're going, I don't know where they go. I don't think that they're going to be able to have the owner's economics in wireless to truly compete on value on the wireless side. And I don't think that AT&T and Verizon have the wherewithal or the plans to compete with us on the quality of the 5G network that we're building. and so, we really like the hand of cards for that reason strategically. Thanks, Dave. Do we want to go one more on the -- did you find? we're going to be expanding our T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile products. Not [Indiscernible] we have expanded them into Walmart and across 2,300 stores on Walmart and a lot of those in smaller markets and rural areas, of course. And then also have launched T-Mobile and Best Buy across 900 stores. We're incredibly excited about this. I think when you look at what Walmart has done and what Best Buy has done in the pandemic and how they have completely revolutionized their particular companies. Walmart is the place to go shop in rural America. It is incredible what Walmart has done digital transformation and then when you look at Best Buy as a premier consumer electronics retailer across the U.S, those are attractive opportunities for us. You've got to remember too is that we haven't really played in national retail in these large national retailers in a very long time. As matter of fact, just in the last quarter, we quadrupled with these announcements, our number of national retail locations. So, we see those as big opportunities for our Company to be in the customer basis of Walmart and in Best Buy and see significant switching opportunities in those spaces as well. So, we're very attracted to what Walmart is doing, what Best Buy is doing.  Clearly, they are attracted to the industry's best 5G network and all of the opportunity that our Company represents over the next several years. So, we're very bullish on that. I don't have numbers exactly by channel to give you in Q4 or the years beyond. But I'll just tell you that we're very bullish about these opportunities. We've got great strategic relationships with Walmart and Best Buy, we've been engaged in a lot of conversations over the last several months, and we're very excited about the future and very confident in our approach there."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Thank you. Welcome to T-Mobile's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor factbook and other documents related to our Q2 results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed in this call can be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations website. I'd like to remind everyone that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020 represent the stand-alone T-Mobile prior to the merger with Sprint. I would also like to note that we are in the quiet period for Auction 110 and will not comment directly or indirectly on that spectrum. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. It is so great to be coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington headquarters here, all gathered together with increasing numbers of our employees with each passing week. And it's just great to feel the energy of this team. And it's no doubt fueled by this quarter's fantastic results. T-Mobile delivered another outstanding quarter of profitable and industry-leading growth, beating our numbers across the board and leading the industry in postpaid net subscriber growth and service revenue growth yet again. And we did it while simultaneously delivering record core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow above expectations, all of this while accelerating the transition of Sprint customer traffic onto the T-Mobile network, further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. And these results all culminate in a 16% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, 16%, which is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey and the unlocking of massive shareholder value. Listen, we're just past halftime in the game here for 2021 and our team is feeling more confident than ever. So we're increasing our guidance expectations across the board with today's announcement. Net additions, core EBITDA, synergies, capex investments and cash flow outlooks for the year are all being increased today. These results stem from our focus on executing on our three core ambitions that I talked with you about before, delivering industry-leading profitable growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger while transforming our business and positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong brand and the best customer experiences. Let's start by talking about growth. Our 1.3 million postpaid nets were the best in the industry and we continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth year-to-date as well, adding another 627,000 postpaid phone net adds in Q2, above our plan and consensus. This include another strong quarter of growth from T-Mobile for business, driven by customer wins in key industries, including airlines, automotive and retail and government agencies such as the Department of Veteran Affairs and the US Army. But importantly, our reliable profitable growth is the product of our progress on churn. T-Mobile again produced the biggest sequential improvement in postpaid phone churn compared to all other wireless operators this quarter, delivering 0.87%. We continue to make great strides in improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences. And we continue to see the lowest churn in the entire industry from our loyalty mobile branded customers. Our T-Mobile brand's consumer churn is lower than Verizon's and this quarter, so is our business journey [ph]. This achievement is a testament to our awesome customer-loving team and also to our synergy-backed model, which allows us to sustainably deliver the best value, while rapidly building fame as America's best 5G network. And unlike the other guys, we've got room to run our higher Sprint churn is rapidly improving, giving us ongoing potential tailwinds in this area. Speaking of our customer-loving team, just this morning, we were awarded the number one ranking from J.D. Power in US Customer Care Performance for the 22nd time. And our Net Promoter Score for customer care among our Sprint customers is up 48% year-over-year. The way we care for our customers is part of our secret sauce and it's important moat around our business. Now with all the line growth we've been seeing in the industry, another strong metric to watch is postpaid accounts, which represents new overall customer building relationships. As we said during our Analyst Day, our strategy is built upon establishing new account relationships and growing them over time with additional products and services to drive ARPA growth. This quarter, we delivered our highest ever postpaid account growth at 349,000 and we continue to focus on capturing quality profitable growth. I'll say it again. This quarter's account growth was our highest ever at least in all the years I've been here. That's over 600,000 net postpaid accounts added year-to-date compared to Verizon, which is still negatives for so far this year and AT&T who doesn't want to share account growth information. In addition, we are a largest prepaid provider in the country. And we're consistently growing and delivering strong ARPUs in this valuable customer segment despite our size and despite the ongoing industry growth of postpaid at the expense of prepaid. In Q2, we delivered 76,000 net adds, which reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.62%. Okay, let's discuss the financial outcomes. One thing that continues to distinguish us as an investment is that only T-Mobile is converting that record service revenue and our synergy-backed model in the industry-leading core EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow growth. What's even more exciting is that we are delivering these results before we begin to fully capitalize on our 5G leadership and before we fully tap into the new market opportunities and underpenetrated segments we've been discussing. Peter will tell you more about our financial results here in a minute, but what I'll say is that T-Mobile showed again today that we consistently deliver smart growth on the top-line metrics, while consistently leading on financial outcomes like core EBITDA and cash flow, pacing nicely to unlock the massive cash flows we outlined in our five-year plan, a plan that promised outcomes we are reiterating here today, built around consistent disciplined market-leading profitable growth. Our opportunities are enabled by the fact that we already have America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. And as we continue to pull further away from the pack with the pace of our network build, we're clearly beginning to differentiate ourselves not just on 5G but on network performance overall. Already this year, seven third-party network report show that T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G speeds and spend the most time connected to 5G. While others are touching to the work of a single paid consultant to support their network claims, our 5G leadership is showing up loud and clear time and again and reports that are coming from multiple, independent, industry-leading firms that look at real customer usage from billions of device measurements. Now I know we all spend a lot of time talking about 5G and for good reason, but we have also quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, the latest Ookla data shows that T-Mobile customers get the fastest overall network speeds nationwide and T-Mobile swept every mobile category in Ookla's latest report. This is in addition to OpenSignal's latest findings that T-Mobile delivers the best 4G availability. And Umlaut's latest report, which highlights again that T-Mobile has the most reliable network overall. So whether customers are on 4G LTE or 5G, they're covered by a far-reaching and speedy network at T-Mobile. Speaking of far-reaching, did all of you touched Neville's blog earlier this week, he announced that T-Mobile's extended range 5G now reaches 305 million people, that's nearly everybody. And we surpassed our year-end milestone roughly six months ahead of schedule, thanks to the terrific momentum of our team. Think of it this way. Our 5G network covers 92% of Interstate Highway miles across 5G -- across America. With 5G, 92% today compared to just 68% for AT&T and only 51% for Verizon as an example. However, where we are really unlocking transformative experiences for our customers is with our game-changing Ultra Capacity 5G, which as you know, we are rolling out at an unprecedented pace. We already cover half of the US population delivering average download speeds of 350 megabits per second to 165 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G. And we continue to increase both the breadth and depth of our mid-band deployment providing a 50% increase in our customers' average 5G download speeds just since the beginning of this year, according to billions of real-time device measurements by OpenSignal. That's because we're not just rolling out Ultra Capacity 5G to more of the population targeting 200 million people by year-end, but we are also adding spectrum targeting 100 megahertz before year-end, about what AT&T and Verizon will light up sometime next year with C-band combined. We're well ahead in our 5G leadership. But what I hope is also becoming increasingly clear is that T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era, thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum and our synergy-backed model. We're doing just what we've said we would do during the merger process, leading America into the 5G era and doing it without leaving rural areas behind. And this leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. The 5G era is here and seven out of 10 customers say they're excited about it. T-Mobile's 5G network perception is rapidly changing. And just since March, T-Mobile has seen a 25% increase in people viewing us as the leader in 5G. Now at 26%, we're closing in on Verizon's stagnant 35% number on this metric. And we're way ahead of AT&T. And as for business customers, already over 40% of enterprise decision makers think of T-Mobile as a leader in 5G with 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider. Our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for them to choose T-Mobile. This network progress is also helping to fuel the rapid realization of merger synergies and our continued progress on integration. For the second quarter in a row, we're raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved one-third of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network. And this is important. We're now carrying approximately 80% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network. This is all within just five quarters of closing the merger. And as planned, we're also expanding into new and underpenetrated businesses. We commercially launched our broad 5G Home Internet offering at the beginning of the second quarter. We continue to see great customer satisfaction and product demand continues to put us on track for our target of 500,000 Home Internet customers this year even with demand exceeding our supply for modems at times earlier this year. And we're already seeing third-party recognition, including PC Magazine recently publishing it's Readers' Choice Awards, where T-Mobile Home Internet is ranked higher than every single cable provider by actual customers for overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend. For enterprise and government, our plan is built on taking share in core wireless, and it's well on track as I discussed earlier. But in addition, our 5G network creates a platform for growth beyond core wireless. And we are focused on helping customers realize value from emerging technologies such as private networks and mobile edge compute, which are exciting potential upsides to our plan. We're already in trial programs with major enterprises in these areas, including 12 of the Fortune 50, even though we don't issue empty press releases about it every week. Meanwhile, we're building our best value, best network, best customer experiences formula to smaller markets and rural areas as well, which make up 40% of US households. We've kicked off initiatives to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond urban areas as well as new initiatives and offers. We're already seeing some early success as smaller markets and rural areas drove nearly one-third of our new postpaid account activations in Q2, up from about a quarter last year. The potential here is super-exciting. So, if I get ready to turn it over to Peter to take you through our financials, I want to take a moment to thank our team for delivering another remarkable quarter, delivering the highest postpaid customer growth and service revenue growth in the industry, while translating that into the highest core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in the industry. We continue to execute our integration playbook to unlock merger synergies ahead of schedule and we further expanded our 5G lead with the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network, planting the seeds for our future success. So, okay, let me turn it over to Peter to take you through the financials and our guidance.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we continue to have strong momentum across the business. We beat expectations yet again in Q2 as we delivered on our winning playbook. So let me briefly discuss these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.5 billion, up an industry-leading 10% year-over-year or roughly 6% normalizing for the Boost MVNO and 2% sequentially, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Both cost of services and SG&A expenses, excluding merger-related costs, were lower as a percentage of service revenue on a year-over-year and sequential basis, reflecting the continued scale benefits we are delivering for merger synergy realization. Net income of $978 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 were both also better than consensus expectations. Core adjusted EBITDA was a record $6 billion and up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued profitable service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities grew to $3.8 billion, driven by our strong operating performance and synergy realization, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, amounted to $3.3 billion, which was up $1 billion from a year ago as we continue to aggressively invest in the buildout of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow, excluding gross payments for settlements of interest rate swaps, amounted to $1.7 billion, which grew an industry best 16% from a year ago, even with the significantly higher capex investment and was also fully burdened by merger-related costs of $190 million. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, was $133.55 as we continue to deepen customer account relationships. Postpaid phone ARPU was $47.61, up from the low water mark in Q1, as we foreshadowed. We expect continued tailwinds from premium service revenue adoption, including benefits from Magenta Max to be partially offset by the remaining tail of Sprint customer rate plan migrations and growing lines per account. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 postpaid phone ARPU dilution to be less than 1% compared to 2020. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. In May, we issued senior notes in an aggregate amount of $3 billion at an average interest rate of approximately 2.97%, including setting a record in the high yield market for the lowest yield ever for a five-year tranche, underscoring our momentum as we progress towards our goal of an all investment grade capital structure. We used the proceeds to retire three notes with coupons roughly double the cost of the newly raised debt. Amazing execution yet again by the team all around to deliver these strong Q2 results. So let's touch on how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raise quarter from T-Mobile, as Mike mentioned. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us, both in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between $5 million and 5.3 million, taking the low end above the top of our prior guidance range of $4.4 million to $4.9 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities from expected increased switching activity in the second half of the year. This also assumes a higher mix of postpaid phone net additions as a percentage of the total postpaid net additions in the second half. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23 billion and $23.3 billion, primarily driven by service revenue growth and our expectation for higher merger synergies in 2021, which are now expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion before taxes with the second half being relatively evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.9 billion, up from our prior guidance of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. We expect cash capex to now be between $12 billion and $12.3 billion, up from our prior guidance to be at the high end of original range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration. Together, this results in free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, which does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. This reflects our increasingly strong cash flow generation more than fully funding higher levels of capital investment. And finally, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 23% to 25%, the improvement versus our prior guide being primarily driven by certain state tax benefits. Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead in the future. All right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator? First question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Just one from me. I'm wondering can you give us some more context on the DISH deal? It would be great to get a little bit more of an understanding of kind of the mechanics behind the scenes and the reasons why you let that relationship go. But also, I would love to get some context from you on how you think this sort of new deal that they've got with AT&T impacts the wireless industry overall. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jonathan. First of all, Peter, you owe me $100, the first question was in fact about DISH. Let me point out a couple of things.\nJonathan Chaplin: I hate to be predictable.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Let me point out a couple of things about this. One is, I want to make sure people understand, particularly investors understand, that when we presented you our five-year plan, we had already factored in rapid declines for DISH revenue into our plan. And so that's kind of in the run rate. I'll get to it. It could go a little faster than we had thought. But I want to make sure you understand that. We have done that for a number of reasons. One, we can observe a rapid decline in customers over at DISH. And we don't have a lot of knowledge about their operations and so there's no reasons for us to do anything other than drag right on that when we make our plans. And secondly, we took them at their word that they would build a facilities-based network and vacate ours as soon as possible. So all that was built into our run rate, so much so that in our five-year planning horizon, by the end of it, we had substantially taken out all of the DISH revenues in our plans and the vast majority of them by the end of our planning period. Now, it's possible that with this development with AT&T that they will move faster than even we anticipated in moving off our network. And that will open up some both opportunities as well as some gaps in our financial plan. And I want to make sure a couple of things are clear. First of all, we've looked at this carefully and we are here today reiterating every aspect of our five-year plan, both in the medium-term and in the long-term that we communicated earlier this year. And there's a couple of reasons for that. When we look at this, one of the things I've learned in wireless is that every time you've got a good guy coming at you, there's some opposing bad guy you have to manage. Like great growth, it's going to cost you in EBITDA, for example, and you've got to manage that. Or in AT&T's case, billions and billions of dollars in future revenues reversals hung up on their balance sheet. But on the other hand, when you get a bad guy like potentially DISH moving faster off our networks than we thought, it opens up opportunities. One of the things that we see right away is that when they move off of our network, that's going to open up both management attention, but more importantly capacity. And so many things in our plan are predicated on available capacity. Like, for example, home broadband where we don't think we're going to be so much paced by the demand, we're going to be paced by the available network capacity. So there's an opportunity to go faster. Or enterprise share taking, where our ability to put ambitious offers in front of customers is paced by what, available capacity, our ability to bring in new wholesale partners or double down with our existing ones. This is something that ultimately when we look at it, we're not really that displeased, which gets to the core premise of your question because it's going to allow us to do what we do best, focus on our knitting and get after share taking and building this great network. And that's always been sort of the core premise of the five-year plan that we put in front of you. I'll say a couple of things to wrap up. One, we like and respect the DISH team and we are here for them. So, to the extent that they want us, we're here, more or less, it's up to them. We will honor every obligation and continue to honor every obligation that we've made to both them and to the government. And overall, we are going to get after growing our core business and working with our core partners. And we're here today after looking at it carefully to reiterate every single promise that we made to you in our five-year plan.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, Mike\nMike Sievert: You bet, John.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. I may cost you another $100 because I'm going to go back to the DISH deal one more time. And just the duration of the DISH deal is quite a bit longer than what you were willing to offer when you originally signed the deal. Can you just talk about were you willing to extend the deal or was the duration a significant part of the negotiation? And then, I guess, just a more general question. Where's all the growth in the market coming from? I mean, we are seeing growth that's now, what, 5 times population growth rate in total phone subscriptions. Can you just talk about what it is that's driving that kind of growth and how sustainable you think that will be for how long?\nMike Sievert: Yes. Let's jump in on both those. And then, I might ask Peter or John to add to it. As for the agreement, one of the things, obviously, to point out -- I think everybody knows this -- is that our arrangement with DISH is a product of a merger remedy package. And it's highly negotiated and it wasn't something that we looked at in our business plan and had built in originally. We planned to operate the Boost business. So it was part of a remedy package. And in that sense, we were sort of thrust together and has to negotiate this. We did have a shorter-term than what we saw -- communicated in the AT&T agreement, but I don't really have much comment on that. I'm not privy to what interactions happen between them -- between DISH and AT&T. I'm very immersed in the interactions we've had with DISH. Yes, it had a certain term. It had it for a reason. Because remember, the remedy package was meant for DISH to get after building their own facilities-based network as fast as possible and to move their revenues and their customers onto that as fast as possible. That was always the intention. And some are asking whether this still enables that or still we'll see that happen or not. I don't know. You'll have to check with them. As it relates to the second question, what we'll see going forward, one of you guys want to jump in?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Let me jump in on just DISH one more because I know we have, before it costs me $300. We have some questions coming in on the impact. And as Mike said, we are here today reiterating the mid and long-term guidance that we put out there at Analyst Day. And there has been some questions out there around, well, is it $2.5 billion of revenue currently? I think there's some extrapolation perhaps from DISH's cost of service line item. I just am here to say it's already less than $2 billion on an annual basis in 2021. And again, because we assumed DISH would be a successful competitor and would build out their own facilities and take customers off, that was already reflected as a decrease in the run rate. But also, one of the things we talked about in Analyst Day is the prudent plan that we put in front of you, right, with multiple upside opportunities. And that included things, as Mike alluded to, Mobile Edge compute, virtual networking, but also the ability to either slow down the ARPU dilution that was assumed in the plan as we expanded relationships, go deeper faster in smaller markets, rural areas and a whole host of other factors. The ability to grow ARPA on a faster rate as we deepened relationships. And what you're really seeing in 2021 and what's encouraging is the success that we've had to-date from a new account perspective, from an ARPA growth perspective, from the ARPU stability that we're giving you. So we're here to absolutely reaffirm everything in the mid- and long-term guidance, all the way down to free cash flow. I see some questions on Twitter coming in that way. So, just wanted to make sure that was out there. And again, that's the focus of this team. We put out prudent plans and then our job is to beat them. And that's why we're here reaffirming things.\nMike Sievert: And we still see the upsides that we saw then [indiscernible], very exciting potentially. So as it relates to accounts, this is what I know that everybody's asking this and all of us only have a lens on our own business. And so, we really can't give you all that much to go on. I can tell you a few things. One, as you heard in my remarks that we're making sure that everybody understands where our focus is. And our focus is on growing profitable overall account relationships, 600,000 of them on the postpaid side so far this year. This last quarter, the biggest new account quarter in our history. And accounts are a great metric because there totally new billing relationship, it's probably somebody porting over and they are an important metric. I heard during the earnings season, one of my competitors sort of said, hey, we're focused on quality growth and not all accounts are created equal. And what I would say to that is, but service revenues are. And T-Mobile led again on service revenue growth was 10% normalized for some things last year, 6% overall service revenue growth, the best in the industry. And so, look, there's some prepaid to postpaid transfers going on, there's some deepening of account relationships with [indiscernible]. There's a lot of dynamics, but it's one of the reasons why I want to make sure that you're hearing us focusing on our knitting about growing overall profitable relationships that result in the market's best service revenue and EBITDA growth. Anybody want to pile on and say where things are coming from?\nPeter Osvaldik: I think that's perfect gambling [ph]. The only thing I would add, Mike -- and hi Craig -- is, yes, there is a big transference from the prepaid category to the postpaid category. You're seeing that happen more from a macro perspective, lots and lots of people from prepaid moving into the postpaid based on the economic realities that you're seeing in the country, which makes our prepaid growth that much more impressive. When you think about us being the leading prepaid provider in the entire industry and putting up another 76,000 postpaid phone -- excuse me -- prepaid nets and having our industry are at record low churn on much on prepaid, just really incredible in terms of what's happening in that space. And that's a big draw into postpaid specifically is what you're seeing from a macro perspective in prepaid.\nCraig Moffett: Good.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet. So let's do another one from the phone. And then let's see if somebody scanning the ones coming in on Twitter. We can pick one or two of those if you want to call them out. But first, let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: And our next phone question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: So, as you highlighted during your remarks, this was a pretty solid churn quarter. As you observe the Sprint customer base kind of go through this transition into a T-Mobile customer base, what are the points along the way that seem to be correlated with step function improvements in churn among those legacy Sprint customers? And as you look out over the next couple of quarters as you continue to go through the process, how often are we going to be hitting those? Because I think that the real focus here is, it seems like you're making great headway at moving the base over, so how low can churn go and how quickly can you get there as you move through that process? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Yes. thanks, Brett. I mean, we have a lot of work left to do. And we're pleased with our progress. We're ahead of schedule. But this next year is a really critical time. And remember, in an integration like ours, there are separate -- we designed this to be able to do separate discrete events when it comes to the migration. One is, when do you migrate the substantial portion of their network traffic? Two is, when do you migrate their account relationship in terms of the core network that they're attached to? Three is, when do you migrate their rate plan through a destination rate plan? Four is, when do you migrate their biller? Because that can be a discrete event. And finally, when do you start telling them their T-Mobile migrate their brand? All of these can be discrete events. And all of them can contribute to churn improvement. By the way, there is some bumpiness. We're actually starting the process long promised of turning down the network on the store side and adding that capacity through the destination side. And that'll create mostly delight, but it will also create some bumpiness. So there'll be opportunities netted out with some pressures. And overall, it looks like a net opportunity to us. But we're entering a really acute stage here over the next 12 months where we will begin doing billing migrations at a faster pace. We'll begin doing brand migrations. The way we serve people with our exclusive team of experts model will be start to ramping -- to ramp up and will simultaneously start turning down those network sites that are not keep sites so that we can start to get you those concrete synergic flows. All those things will be happening simultaneously. And so far, we're just delighted with how it's going. But at the same time, we see lots of opportunity to put an arm around and love those Sprint customers and we're all over it.\nBrett Feldman: If you don't mind, I guess, a quick follow-up. Early in the process, there is a lot of questions about whether the Sprint customer base has the potential to have the churn profile of the legacy T-Mobile base. Now that you're several quarters in and some of those customers have been with you for a while, what's your latest assessment there? Do you think that the long-term churn profile that acquired base can match or get close to what you've historically shown us?\nMike Sievert: Absolutely. And one of the ways you can look at that is, when we look underneath that there are different kinds of situations of Sprint customers. For example, people who are happily into device payment plan that was given to them on fair terms and who have a great rate plan, their churn is already remarkably well. And most of their data is on the T-Mobile network. And so, we see that situation in our base. On the other hand, people who have a situation that's less palatable to them from a variety of promotions that had raising prices or the way their device plan work, so they're not in a device relationship with us and they're kind of a jump ball. Yes, those churn numbers are still higher. And our job is to welcome them to T-Mobile with the great taxes and fees included rate plans and Netflix on us and T-Mobile Tuesday's and team of experts care and of course the best 5G network in the country. And that's happening at pace, but we're only working our way through the base.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nPeter Osvaldik: And Brett, to your point. This is one of those areas of opportunity that we highlighted at Analyst Day where the plan over the medium-term was really to close the gap in half to T-Mobile. So the extent that we get through this period -- this next period of 12 to 18 months rollout all the benefits of T-Mobile, it's an opportunity, right. As we see maybe closer alignment during that period to the Magenta base.\nMike Sievert: That could wind up being a nice upside, because only closing half the gap. Yes, that's what's written into our plan.\nBrett Feldman: Great. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: What are we seeing on the Twitter before we go back to [indiscernible].\nJud Henry: Well, you've got -- while it's got a couple of good questions in here, one about 2.5-gigahertz deployment, which I'm sure Neville could hit and a little bit about on postpaid phone gross adds and add lines, which I think we have some great insight on.\nMike Sievert: He doesn't do the calls anymore. He's just digital versus digital.\nBrett Feldman: Okay, fair enough.\nJud Henry: You've got in multiple questions.\nBrett Feldman: That way [ph].\nMike Sievert: Well, let's read it out. So, go to one feed, does the DISH move to see impact free cash flow guidance? No. Why is there only 40-megahertz of 2.5-gig in some markets? When it will be a 100-megahertz or 160 everywhere? Let's talk about that, because how our advantage level translates into not only people covered POPs but megahertz deployed to those POPs to geek out on an old industry term, megahertz POPs. The difference between what we can offer in the next few months versus AT&T and Verizon and then how that translates into years long advantage, it's pretty start. Maybe you can talk about where we are and where we're going.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. So, if we pick up on Mike's comments earlier in the 165 million covered people we have already today with our Ultra Capacity mid-band solution. With 35 million away from an end-of-year goal of 200 million people covered with Ultra Capacity solution, which is a nationwide claim basis. So that's the progress we're making with super close, it's July. I'm very confident about our ability to hit the 200 million. And to your question, Walt [ph], that's the point in time we're targeting on average 100 megahertz of spectrum will be available across that footprint, 100 megahertz of the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum, the best mid-band spectrum there is out there in this 5G category. So that's exciting. And if you compare and contrast that to what AT&T and Verizon have announced to-date, they're talking about 100 million people covered at some point in time in the New Year. And between them, the C-band spectrum holdings, they have 100 megahertz, Verizon 60 and AT&T 40. So when you compound the footprint and the spectrum available, obviously we have a massive lead. And the good news is that that lead is there and it's durable and it's sustainable as we move into the coming years. AT&T and Verizon will try and match what we will do this year by the end of 2023 when they get more C-band spectrum available in the second tranche. Of course, we get C-band spectrum at the end of 2023 too. But the important piece is, we're not sitting at 200 million covered POPs at the end of this year. Our goal is to be at 300 million covered POPs by the end of '23 and to double that spectrum position from a 100-megahertz of mid-band to 200 megahertz. And then your question, Walt, you mentioned 160-megahertz of 2.5. Our plan is to have all of that deployed for 5G plus additional mid-band from our AWS and PCS Holdings. This set us up for an incredible leadership position that AT&T and Verizon will spend many years trying to match.\nMike Sievert: I was expecting a follow-up question. I forgot he is on Twitter. Okay. So good. Let's go back to the phone and we'll get ready for another Twitter one after that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Phil.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hi, Mike. You noted in the factbook that the phone increase was driven in part by T-Mobile for business. Where are you on that? Can you quantify the size of that customer base and the growth? And then, similar on home broadband, can you tell us what the contribution was there in the quarter and how that should pace from here? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Beautiful. We'll turn it over to the leaders of those two business groups. I am just delighted with what we're seeing on T-Mobile for business. It's a big contributor. We outpaced Verizon this quarter, fantastic, even outpaced Verizon on churn. So people wonder whether we're for real and in business. We're for real. Maybe Mike, you can talk about what's driving it, and then we'll flip over and talk about what we're seeing in home broadband.\nMike Katz: Thanks, Mike. I'm really pleased with what we saw this quarter. And as we talked about in Analyst Day, our focus has really been going after the postpaid core connection opportunity. Because if you look at all the opportunities in enterprise, core connectivity still is the largest opportunity both from number of subscribers but also from revenue. So we've been really focused on taking share there. And we've been really leveraging several very distinct strategies to go do that. First and foremost, its network. And it's all the things that Neville just talked about with 5G, we have a distinct advantage right now in the 5G network. We've got a huge lead that right now our competitors can't touch. And that matters in this enterprise space. And so, we've been using that to really get conversation started with enterprise, using it to get into testing with enterprise. And when they test us side by side, we win -- we simply win because we can't be touched in 5G right now. We're also really focused on disrupting in enterprise, specifically around simplicity and value. One of the things that you've heard us talk earlier in the year when we launched WFX solutions, how complex the enterprise space is with core wireless, still lots of pool plans and sharing. And when you're doing that across tens of thousands employees, it's incredibly complex, so complex in fact that we see come -- see enterprises hiring third-party companies to manage it. And we've really seen enterprise respond favorably when we can come in and offer a much more simple, much more straightforward value proposition. So, those have been some of the big key stuff we're doing it. And like Mike said, it's really translated into incredible results. We beat Verizon again in total postpaid adds and that growth is translating both into year-over-year revenue improvements that are double-digit and the network is really resonating with the base where we saw both year-over-year and sequential decreases in churn from our postpaid customers. And you heard Mike mention in the opening comments, lower than Verizon in this quarter. And so...\nMike Sievert: We're talking about blended, not just on the T-Mobile side, but overall -- blended overall. That's terrific. Well done. Your second part of your question, Phil, is about home broadband. And we're just out of the gates. We're really pleased with what we're seeing. Dow Draper leads all of our emerging businesses. And one of the things I'll say to tee up Dow is that one of our early insights is that, it sure does it look like this is going to be about demand. This is going to be paced by network capacity as I mentioned in my answer on DISH by device capacity for a minute here as we recover from COVID, but not by demand. And by the way, the customer experience is pretty exciting too. But Dow, why don't you tell us what you're seeing?\nDow Draper: Thanks, Mike. I mean, first off, thanks for the question, Phil, because we're super enthusiastic about this business. And as you -- as we talked about previous this year and we really entered '21 with 100,000 customers in a pilot. And then we officially launched in April to 30 million households with our 5G Home Internet service. And there's really -- it's early days here, basically echo what Mike said, we started and what we've earned is that one is the customer satisfaction and what customers are telling us about the product is really positive. Our customer satisfaction scores are very high in an industry that is known for basically bottom of the barrel customer satisfaction metrics and so that's really, really great to see and it's nice to get the results of the survey in PC Magazine's Readers Choice article and so it's great to see that. And then what that's also translating to is, we are seeing demand outpace -- really outpaced supply in the second quarter. And we've done a lot of things, we're working to catch up with that. We think we're going to be caught back up here in the next month. And so, what that means is, our aspiration was to end the year with 500,000 home broadband customers. And we feel really good about that trajectory.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Dow.\nJud Henry: I think we should go to -- there is a couple in here about prepaid which you touched on, but there is lots of -- will go from Bill Ho, prepaid seems to have a resurgence given yesterday's aggressive offer, given the comments on postpaid, prepaid blurring has anything triggered this second half prepaid thinking and any color on this amazing stellar drop in prepaid churn. And he kind of goes on about the aggressive offer that we just launched.\nMike Sievert: One of the things, it's 5G, look, we just -- as a company, we don't believe that 5G is for rich people on postpaid plans. We need it for everybody. And that's really important. And we're moving absolutely ambitiously to make sure everybody gets a chance to see and experience this remarkable network and by the way, with prepaid customers. That's even more important for so many of them because their phone for many of them is their only connection to the Internet. It has to be a great connection. And it's just such an advantage for us to have the nation's leading prepaid brand on the nation's leading 5G network. And we never held back. From day one, we said, hey, that's for you also. And right now, we have an incredible offer for people to switch from booster cricket, it don't seem to be growing at a fast pace to introduce prepaid customers to 5G and not only to give them a great rate plan, but also to give them a brand new Samsung Galaxy 5G phone. And so, it's a fantastic offer, really it's about celebrating this-5G moment and getting people to come see what our network leadership is all about. And I think that's a contributor. That network leadership both on 4G and 5G is certainly a contributor to the lowest churn we've ever seen or anybody has ever seen from a major prepaid brand. Let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: And we'll go to Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, you're expecting higher switching activity in the second half of the year. So I'm just curious, is that something you are already seeing -- and is that suggesting that there will be a higher churn environment for the entire industry as a result, the security implications there. And then, for Neville, beyond putting more spectrum into use, since the growth in fixed wireless might be constrained by you delivering capacity versus demand for the product, is there other things that are happening in future years beyond that to drive capacity? Are you going to go back and touch the powers again, will there be software updates or sort of new talent deployments that you're not doing this go around, anything on capacity beyond putting the spectrum to use would be helpful. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: So I'll start and hand it to Neville, then we'll go back to your first question. It's funny, it's the opposite. The question we often get asked is actually the opposite, the converse of years, which is you're building all these incredible capacity, what are the use cases? Tell us please now about 5G use cases? How are you going to fill up all that capacity? And it's really important you asked the question the way you did because wireless home broadband is one of the killer apps of 5G. And that's why I mentioned earlier that anything that frees up capacity to allow us to go faster on this multi-billion-dollar opportunity is a good guy. And -- but maybe we can talk about that whole equation of what you're seeing when it comes to enabling home broadband and other high-capacity applications. Neville?\nNeville Ray: Yes. I mean, I think obviously the heart of the opportunity is spectrum. And we are in a strong position and I outlined for you the pace at which we're deploying that 5G spectrum, which is going to create a fairly sharp contrast with our competition. I mean, I love our messaging on 5G for role. And part of that is that the prepaid segment of the customer base that we just talked about, but it's also really hitting all corners of the United States, right. Going into rural market, small town America and bringing 5G capacity and capability at an incredible pace. And I think that's going to position us for a long-term advantage in those market areas. That capacity and capability going into those marketplaces is going to open up enormous opportunity on in-home broadband. So it's not just the application of a great set of spectrum. It's where and how and the pace at which we do it. I think, the other piece is not to get too geeky, right, but 5G is just really beginning. And the features and capabilities and the spectral efficiency that we can secure from a 5G bearer, we're at the very beginning of that journey. We're only just now rolling out 5G in the mid-band space. And if you look at what happened with LTE over a decade plus material improvements in the capacity and capability of what we could support with our radio network. And that's going to come with 5G too. There's a very rich future and roadmap to enhance the capacity and capability that we can bring. So, you add all those pieces together. This is an incredible 5G factory that we're building. And to Mike's comment, I mean, we're excited about all of the opportunities with which we can fill up this capacity bucket that we'll roll out over the next three, four, five years, but the opportunity especially in the near-term is going to be critical across the country and especially in those major markets where we make the first start.\nMike Sievert: All right. Your first question was about switching and trends we're seeing with churn in the second half. I'll tee it up and hand it to Jon. A lot of this is seasonal. I mean, second half is usually a period with higher switching activity and higher churn. This year, there's the additional dynamic of COVID which is a little bit of a wildcard. But the broad trends notwithstanding Delta variant do look like a continuation of opening up. And then of course in the fall time in prior years, we've generally had big important new phone launches. And if you take all that together, we've made on the guidance to fund our plan to compete profitably, ambitiously, reasonably but to compete in the second half to make sure that we're competitive. But Jon, why don't you say what you're seeing?\nJon Freier: Yes, that's exactly what I want to say, Mike, that seasonally in the second half of the year, you have three big moments, you've got a big bang SCOR [ph] moment that will be much more of a prominent moment this year versus perhaps last year. Then, like Mike said, you have a premium smartphone introduction that's typically in the fall timeframe, you never know, but typically in the fall timeframe. And then of course you have a holiday period. So what we're seeing is, we're seeing a continued reopening. We've been seeing that. I think I said last quarter that there are some places throughout the country even last quarter like Texas and Florida and some states like that were fully open and then other places like New York and California is still gradually reopening. We're still seeing that in terms of those states and some of those big markets that are still, gradually reopening. We expect that to continue. Like Mike said just a few moments ago, don't know whether Delta is going or any kind of variance that might be out there, but we're well in the position to post-vaccine environment to be able to manage that. We expect there to be much more activity in the second half of the year versus the first half. We're prepared to win in that space. That's where we win the most. That's what we love to see that kind of competitive activity and there is more people evaluating their options out there. We love that because we want them to look at T-Mobile. And when they look at T-Mobile in there in the market to shop and perhaps switch, they pick us more than not. So we're excited about it.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: All right. You bet. Doug. Okay, let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: Our next phone question will come from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Hey, Mike. How are you? Maybe let's go back to the rural and suburban strategy [indiscernible] contribution in terms of accounts has ticked up to the third of new accounts this quarter. How high can that go and do you expect it to continue to tick up? And I guess, along with that, how far through the investment phase are, we talked about, in hiring local expected increase in distribution? Is that in the run rate or should we expect more? And then lastly, along with that, you guys talked about sort of getting on these synergies, especially taking down and decommissioning the Sprint network and it seems the equation there with either some increase in investment on distribution but eventually we're going to see that the cost come through. When do we see that inflection and investments that we start to see acceleration in the adjusted EBITDA number? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. Well, first of all, let me just say on small markets and rural areas. My opinion, I'll pass it to Jon is, we're in the first inning. We're just getting going a lot of these investments around distribution, around a new way of distributing product, around new offers, around reputation where those things take a little bit. It's just at the very first inning. And yet, we're seeing the market respond. So that gives -- that makes us very optimistic. Peter, I think, rightly pointed out that in our five-year plan, we shared with you, there were a number of important upsides. And one of them is, we would hope there might be a chance to exceed our migration from the 13% market share we had today to the destination 20% in the five-year horizon that we communicated to you. I just told you that in this quarter in the first inning, we're seeing about a third of our activations come from those markets, pretty exciting. So -- and John, some of these questions are about okay. What have we accomplished and what's next and what can we expect?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Like Mike said, I too -- I mean, I'm so excited and increasingly enthusiastic about this opportunity for us. And as Mike highlighted in his opening comments, this is a huge opportunity for us, it's roughly 40% of the market, call it 50 million households, 140 million people, call it low teens market share. So we have a huge opportunity, specifically to the activities we said this year that we would be opening 200 retail stores, that's well on pace to be able to get done, also hiring 1,000 mobile hometown experts. And this 1,000 hometown experts, just remember, we're going into cities and towns where it doesn't really make a whole lot of economic sense to build brick-and-mortar distribution. So, this is more extending our reach into places that we ordinarily couldn't get to with retail distribution. That's well on pace as well. So, 200 stores this year, 1,000 hometown experts this year, we made a commitment to have up to 2,500 hometown experts. So we have 1,000 this year as a down payment on that 2,500 and then the balance of that coming into the future quarters and into the next couple of years. So, we're just increasingly excited about it. Like Mike said, almost a third of our postpaid new accounts coming in from smaller markets and rural areas from, call it, a quarter in 2020, it's a big opportunity. It is in the first inning for slow burn. We have a lot of perception to change, but we're capitalizing with this distribution push based on the incredible network that Neville and his team are building out there and bringing 5G to a lot of these places. I mean it's incredible when you think about it. There is not really a 5G strategy, I think, from some of our competitors in rural America. And they shouldn't be left behind. And we have a huge opportunity to go out there and bring Ultra Capacity 5G and so many places and be able to make a big difference of these markets.\nMike Sievert: Perfect. I think -- there was a question, second part of this question was about synergies.\nJonathan Chaplin: Synergies and EBITDA, so I think the run rate, as Jon mentioned, it really continues in the second half from an investment perspective both in distribution here, both in as we talked before, bringing our team of experts model into the Sprint base on a more full basis. So there continues to be investments in also the second half, of course, as we said with the larger switching opportunities with more of the phone launches, quote-unquote, that we don't know about, I may know about and of course holiday season and such. And then, our promotional constructs, as you know, tend to be more front-loaded. We don't hang it up on the balance sheet. But as we go through that, that tends to impact core EBITDA in period. So you'll see a lot of that, the investments, the promotions that we anticipate to be higher as we have more switching and a higher postpaid phone net add in the second half. So that all comes through in core EBITDA, but that is offset by the continuation of synergy unlock. And I think you asked, when is the inflection point in particular as it regards to the network? Well, we're starting. We are still targeting 7,000 8,000 decons by the end of this year. And with the pace that Neville was going, we feel confident about what we put out there at Analyst Day. And so, you see by 2023, we're already assuming we will overachieve against the $6 billion and ultimately on our way to $7.5 billion of run rate synergies by 2024. So, very exciting and you're already seeing that happen when you look at year-over-year margin as a percentage of service revenue. The competition obviously both went down in terms of margin as a percentage of service revenue and we went up. So, you see the power of those synergies and that unlock already starting. Very exciting.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jon.\nMike Sievert: You bet. So we'll go back to the phone and then maybe do we have a couple more on Twitter as well?\nJud Henry: Maybe one and then you have.\nMike Sievert: I have to go. When do I have to go?\nJud Henry: Really after one more phone call.\nMike Sievert: Okay, great.\nOperator: Thank you. We will go to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Simon.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. So, coming back to the fixed wireless, the home broadband, maybe Neville, you could just talk a little bit about the learnings that you are seeing and this critique about your ability to handle the usage of the typical broadband customers. So what are you seeing so far? And I think you've been advertising a speed around 100 megabits a second, but at the same time you're saying Ultra Capacity networks averaging that 350 megabits per second. So what's the upgrade path for those speeds as you roll this network and add more spectrum in there? And then, any color on where the customers are coming from? Are they coming from DSL, coming from cable, neutral broadband, any color there would be great?\nMike Sievert: Go to Neville for the first and Dow for the second.\nNeville Ray: Yes. So thanks, Simon. I mean, obviously so far we're making great progress. I mean, Dow and the team have been working really hard to get this business moving. And the network is moving at real pace to support the capacity and capabilities that are required. The real sweet spot on this program is really the Ultra Capacity. And you've heard this multiple times now talk about the pace and rollout of the Ultra Capacity layer. And that's what really brings this home broadband solution to life and allows us to move into these higher tier speeds many months now around the speeds and capabilities that we can support across this network, across this entire network and those speeds being north of 100 megabits per second. And that all comes to life as we realize all of that spectrum I talked about earlier on moving onto a 5G layer and a massive roll on mid-band spectrum layer. And so, our ability to support the growth is absolutely there. The economics are there because we have a deep and heavy layer of mid-band spectrum in 2.5-gigahertz and so we can secure these upgrades and the economics with almost a single radio deployment to leverage and unleash the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum. Very tough to do the stuff if you have to pull together lots of fragmented bands of spectrum, as for example AT&T has to do. So, for us, four quarters or so, but across the nation. And our ability to really transform that home broadband space in many parts of the country where there is very little competition and very poor service at times is absolutely there for us to go run that.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks, Neville. Terrific.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Simon. All right. So, where we're going now? Last question.\nJud Henry: You can do, you have to go.\nMike Sievert: I have to go. So we're going to take the last question. Therefore, we'll go to the phone. And operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Hi. A couple of follow-up questions. First on ARPU. Just curious if you can unpack what's happening in ARPU in the quarter and for the year in terms of some of the helps in Hertz and how Magenta MAX may also be contributing. And then just taking a step back, what's the expected pace going forward to introduce new un-carrier initiatives? And when you look at the totality of the value that you're offering, are you seeing a continued evolution in the take rates for services such as Netflix or the T-Mobile Tuesday?\nMike Sievert: All right. Yes. Thank you, Mike. And thanks, Mike, for the question. So, ARPU and really the story of ARPA, I'm very pleased, like I said in the prepared remarks around what's happening with ARPU and really a lot of tailwind that we're still seeing with the adoption of Magenta MAX, which is just really a manifestation, another use case of the power of this network and bringing this differentiated product out into the marketplace and the ability for Jon and team on the consumer side to really translate that into value from an ARPU perspective. So that's a lot of the tailwind that we saw from a value add service on a sequential basis. Just remember, we told you Q1 was going to be the low watermark as we really focused in Q1 on moving a significant portion of the Sprint base into their target rate plans. And a little bit of that will continue throughout the latter part of this year. And of course there's going to be continued investment in terms of expanding account relationships. Because remember this plan is built on ARPA growth, not ARPU growth, ARPU is still confident in less than 1% dilution given all the tailwinds there. And the other part that also is an impact here is business. And you heard about the success in business, business enterprise and government larger account sizes. So you typically see that coming in at a lower ARPU than the average consumer, but also tremendously valuable customer relationships there. So, very happy there. In terms of Un-carrier, I wish I could just maybe I'll Twitter you out exactly what we're going to do from an Un-carrier perspective and when it's coming. But the one thing that's true from this team, maniacal focus on profitable growth, but never losing that entrepreneurial spirit that we have. So there is more on the horizon. I'm sure when it comes to Un-carrier moves. We are not done solving the pain points in this industry, ordinary industries like home broadband. So really appreciate it, Mike. Thank you. And I think, probably with that, we'll have to, at this point, conclude the call. So, thank you everybody for tuning in. It's just an amazing set of results, again, another beat and race quarter for T-Mobile. And we're just very optimistic about where we're going. And very glad that you could spend the time with us. So [Technical Difficulty].\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US second quarter 2021 earnings call. If you have any further questions you may contact the Investor Relations or Media departments. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Mike Katz",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I'm really pleased with what we saw this quarter.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we continue to have strong momentum across the business. We beat expectations yet again in Q2 as we delivered on our winning playbook. So let me briefly discuss these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.5 billion, up an industry-leading 10% year-over-year or roughly 6% normalizing for the Boost MVNO and 2% sequentially, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Both cost of services and SG&A expenses, excluding merger-related costs, were lower as a percentage of service revenue on a year-over-year and sequential basis, reflecting the continued scale benefits we are delivering for merger synergy realization. Net income of $978 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.78 were both also better than consensus expectations. Core adjusted EBITDA was a record $6 billion and up 7% year-over-year, driven by continued profitable service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities grew to $3.8 billion, driven by our strong operating performance and synergy realization, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest, amounted to $3.3 billion, which was up $1 billion from a year ago as we continue to aggressively invest in the buildout of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow, excluding gross payments for settlements of interest rate swaps, amounted to $1.7 billion, which grew an industry best 16% from a year ago, even with the significantly higher capex investment and was also fully burdened by merger-related costs of $190 million. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account, was $133.55 as we continue to deepen customer account relationships. Postpaid phone ARPU was $47.61, up from the low water mark in Q1, as we foreshadowed. We expect continued tailwinds from premium service revenue adoption, including benefits from Magenta Max to be partially offset by the remaining tail of Sprint customer rate plan migrations and growing lines per account. Overall, we continue to expect full year 2021 postpaid phone ARPU dilution to be less than 1% compared to 2020. And we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. In May, we issued senior notes in an aggregate amount of $3 billion at an average interest rate of approximately 2.97%, including setting a record in the high yield market for the lowest yield ever for a five-year tranche, underscoring our momentum as we progress towards our goal of an all investment grade capital structure. We used the proceeds to retire three notes with coupons roughly double the cost of the newly raised debt. Amazing execution yet again by the team all around to deliver these strong Q2 results. So let's touch on how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raise quarter from T-Mobile, as Mike mentioned. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us, both in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between $5 million and 5.3 million, taking the low end above the top of our prior guidance range of $4.4 million to $4.9 million, reflecting continued profitable growth and prudent share-taking opportunities from expected increased switching activity in the second half of the year. This also assumes a higher mix of postpaid phone net additions as a percentage of the total postpaid net additions in the second half. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $23 billion and $23.3 billion, primarily driven by service revenue growth and our expectation for higher merger synergies in 2021, which are now expected to be between $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion as we continue our progress towards rapid synergy realization. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion before taxes with the second half being relatively evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $13.6 billion to $13.9 billion, up from our prior guidance of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. We expect cash capex to now be between $12 billion and $12.3 billion, up from our prior guidance to be at the high end of original range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continue the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration. Together, this results in free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, increasing to $5.2 billion to $5.5 billion, which does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. This reflects our increasingly strong cash flow generation more than fully funding higher levels of capital investment. And finally, we now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 23% to 25%, the improvement versus our prior guide being primarily driven by certain state tax benefits. Altogether, our strong momentum and execution enable us to continue to invest in our network and the business to deliver significant expansion in future free cash flow. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for our shareholders, potentially including substantial share repurchases ahead in the future. All right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with the question on the phone. Operator? First question, please. Yes. Let me jump in on just DISH one more because I know we have, before it costs me $300. We have some questions coming in on the impact. And as Mike said, we are here today reiterating the mid and long-term guidance that we put out there at Analyst Day. And there has been some questions out there around, well, is it $2.5 billion of revenue currently? I think there's some extrapolation perhaps from DISH's cost of service line item. I just am here to say it's already less than $2 billion on an annual basis in 2021. And again, because we assumed DISH would be a successful competitor and would build out their own facilities and take customers off, that was already reflected as a decrease in the run rate. But also, one of the things we talked about in Analyst Day is the prudent plan that we put in front of you, right, with multiple upside opportunities. And that included things, as Mike alluded to, Mobile Edge compute, virtual networking, but also the ability to either slow down the ARPU dilution that was assumed in the plan as we expanded relationships, go deeper faster in smaller markets, rural areas and a whole host of other factors. The ability to grow ARPA on a faster rate as we deepened relationships. And what you're really seeing in 2021 and what's encouraging is the success that we've had to-date from a new account perspective, from an ARPA growth perspective, from the ARPU stability that we're giving you. So we're here to absolutely reaffirm everything in the mid- and long-term guidance, all the way down to free cash flow. I see some questions on Twitter coming in that way. So, just wanted to make sure that was out there. And again, that's the focus of this team. We put out prudent plans and then our job is to beat them. And that's why we're here reaffirming things. I think that's perfect gambling [ph]. The only thing I would add, Mike -- and hi Craig -- is, yes, there is a big transference from the prepaid category to the postpaid category. You're seeing that happen more from a macro perspective, lots and lots of people from prepaid moving into the postpaid based on the economic realities that you're seeing in the country, which makes our prepaid growth that much more impressive. When you think about us being the leading prepaid provider in the entire industry and putting up another 76,000 postpaid phone -- excuse me -- prepaid nets and having our industry are at record low churn on much on prepaid, just really incredible in terms of what's happening in that space. And that's a big draw into postpaid specifically is what you're seeing from a macro perspective in prepaid. And Brett, to your point. This is one of those areas of opportunity that we highlighted at Analyst Day where the plan over the medium-term was really to close the gap in half to T-Mobile. So the extent that we get through this period -- this next period of 12 to 18 months rollout all the benefits of T-Mobile, it's an opportunity, right. As we see maybe closer alignment during that period to the Magenta base. Yes, absolutely. So, if we pick up on Mike's comments earlier in the 165 million covered people we have already today with our Ultra Capacity mid-band solution. With 35 million away from an end-of-year goal of 200 million people covered with Ultra Capacity solution, which is a nationwide claim basis. So that's the progress we're making with super close, it's July. I'm very confident about our ability to hit the 200 million. And to your question, Walt [ph], that's the point in time we're targeting on average 100 megahertz of spectrum will be available across that footprint, 100 megahertz of the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum, the best mid-band spectrum there is out there in this 5G category. So that's exciting. And if you compare and contrast that to what AT&T and Verizon have announced to-date, they're talking about 100 million people covered at some point in time in the New Year. And between them, the C-band spectrum holdings, they have 100 megahertz, Verizon 60 and AT&T 40. So when you compound the footprint and the spectrum available, obviously we have a massive lead. And the good news is that that lead is there and it's durable and it's sustainable as we move into the coming years. AT&T and Verizon will try and match what we will do this year by the end of 2023 when they get more C-band spectrum available in the second tranche. Of course, we get C-band spectrum at the end of 2023 too. But the important piece is, we're not sitting at 200 million covered POPs at the end of this year. Our goal is to be at 300 million covered POPs by the end of '23 and to double that spectrum position from a 100-megahertz of mid-band to 200 megahertz. And then your question, Walt, you mentioned 160-megahertz of 2.5. Our plan is to have all of that deployed for 5G plus additional mid-band from our AWS and PCS Holdings. This set us up for an incredible leadership position that AT&T and Verizon will spend many years trying to match. Yes. Like Mike said, I too -- I mean, I'm so excited and increasingly enthusiastic about this opportunity for us. And as Mike highlighted in his opening comments, this is a huge opportunity for us, it's roughly 40% of the market, call it 50 million households, 140 million people, call it low teens market share. So we have a huge opportunity, specifically to the activities we said this year that we would be opening 200 retail stores, that's well on pace to be able to get done, also hiring 1,000 mobile hometown experts. And this 1,000 hometown experts, just remember, we're going into cities and towns where it doesn't really make a whole lot of economic sense to build brick-and-mortar distribution. So, this is more extending our reach into places that we ordinarily couldn't get to with retail distribution. That's well on pace as well. So, 200 stores this year, 1,000 hometown experts this year, we made a commitment to have up to 2,500 hometown experts. So we have 1,000 this year as a down payment on that 2,500 and then the balance of that coming into the future quarters and into the next couple of years. So, we're just increasingly excited about it. Like Mike said, almost a third of our postpaid new accounts coming in from smaller markets and rural areas from, call it, a quarter in 2020, it's a big opportunity. It is in the first inning for slow burn. We have a lot of perception to change, but we're capitalizing with this distribution push based on the incredible network that Neville and his team are building out there and bringing 5G to a lot of these places. I mean it's incredible when you think about it. There is not really a 5G strategy, I think, from some of our competitors in rural America. And they shouldn't be left behind. And we have a huge opportunity to go out there and bring Ultra Capacity 5G and so many places and be able to make a big difference of these markets."

            "content": "Yes, that's exactly what I want to say, Mike, that seasonally in the second half of the year, you have three big moments, you've got a big bang SCOR [ph] moment that will be much more of a prominent moment this year versus perhaps last year. Then, like Mike said, you have a premium smartphone introduction that's typically in the fall timeframe, you never know, but typically in the fall timeframe. And then of course you have a holiday period. So what we're seeing is, we're seeing a continued reopening. We've been seeing that. I think I said last quarter that there are some places throughout the country even last quarter like Texas and Florida and some states like that were fully open and then other places like New York and California is still gradually reopening. We're still seeing that in terms of those states and some of those big markets that are still, gradually reopening. We expect that to continue. Like Mike said just a few moments ago, don't know whether Delta is going or any kind of variance that might be out there, but we're well in the position to post-vaccine environment to be able to manage that. We expect there to be much more activity in the second half of the year versus the first half. We're prepared to win in that space. That's where we win the most. That's what we love to see that kind of competitive activity and there is more people evaluating their options out there. We love that because we want them to look at T-Mobile. And when they look at T-Mobile in there in the market to shop and perhaps switch, they pick us more than not. So we're excited about it."

            "content": "Thanks, Mike. I mean, first off, thanks for the question, Phil, because we're super enthusiastic about this business. And as you -- as we talked about previous this year and we really entered '21 with 100,000 customers in a pilot. And then we officially launched in April to 30 million households with our 5G Home Internet service. And there's really -- it's early days here, basically echo what Mike said, we started and what we've earned is that one is the customer satisfaction and what customers are telling us about the product is really positive. Our customer satisfaction scores are very high in an industry that is known for basically bottom of the barrel customer satisfaction metrics and so that's really, really great to see and it's nice to get the results of the survey in PC Magazine's Readers Choice article and so it's great to see that. And then what that's also translating to is, we are seeing demand outpace -- really outpaced supply in the second quarter. And we've done a lot of things, we're working to catch up with that. We think we're going to be caught back up here in the next month. And so, what that means is, our aspiration was to end the year with 500,000 home broadband customers. And we feel really good about that trajectory."

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes. I mean, I think obviously the heart of the opportunity is spectrum. And we are in a strong position and I outlined for you the pace at which we're deploying that 5G spectrum, which is going to create a fairly sharp contrast with our competition. I mean, I love our messaging on 5G for role. And part of that is that the prepaid segment of the customer base that we just talked about, but it's also really hitting all corners of the United States, right. Going into rural market, small town America and bringing 5G capacity and capability at an incredible pace. And I think that's going to position us for a long-term advantage in those market areas. That capacity and capability going into those marketplaces is going to open up enormous opportunity on in-home broadband. So it's not just the application of a great set of spectrum. It's where and how and the pace at which we do it. I think, the other piece is not to get too geeky, right, but 5G is just really beginning. And the features and capabilities and the spectral efficiency that we can secure from a 5G bearer, we're at the very beginning of that journey. We're only just now rolling out 5G in the mid-band space. And if you look at what happened with LTE over a decade plus material improvements in the capacity and capability of what we could support with our radio network. And that's going to come with 5G too. There's a very rich future and roadmap to enhance the capacity and capability that we can bring. So, you add all those pieces together. This is an incredible 5G factory that we're building. And to Mike's comment, I mean, we're excited about all of the opportunities with which we can fill up this capacity bucket that we'll roll out over the next three, four, five years, but the opportunity especially in the near-term is going to be critical across the country and especially in those major markets where we make the first start. Yes. So thanks, Simon. I mean, obviously so far we're making great progress. I mean, Dow and the team have been working really hard to get this business moving. And the network is moving at real pace to support the capacity and capabilities that are required. The real sweet spot on this program is really the Ultra Capacity. And you've heard this multiple times now talk about the pace and rollout of the Ultra Capacity layer. And that's what really brings this home broadband solution to life and allows us to move into these higher tier speeds many months now around the speeds and capabilities that we can support across this network, across this entire network and those speeds being north of 100 megabits per second. And that all comes to life as we realize all of that spectrum I talked about earlier on moving onto a 5G layer and a massive roll on mid-band spectrum layer. And so, our ability to support the growth is absolutely there. The economics are there because we have a deep and heavy layer of mid-band spectrum in 2.5-gigahertz and so we can secure these upgrades and the economics with almost a single radio deployment to leverage and unleash the 2.5-gigahertz spectrum. Very tough to do the stuff if you have to pull together lots of fragmented bands of spectrum, as for example AT&T has to do. So, for us, four quarters or so, but across the nation. And our ability to really transform that home broadband space in many parts of the country where there is very little competition and very poor service at times is absolutely there for us to go run that."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. It is so great to be coming to you live from our Bellevue, Washington headquarters here, all gathered together with increasing numbers of our employees with each passing week. And it's just great to feel the energy of this team. And it's no doubt fueled by this quarter's fantastic results. T-Mobile delivered another outstanding quarter of profitable and industry-leading growth, beating our numbers across the board and leading the industry in postpaid net subscriber growth and service revenue growth yet again. And we did it while simultaneously delivering record core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow above expectations, all of this while accelerating the transition of Sprint customer traffic onto the T-Mobile network, further extending our 5G network lead and increasing our expected merger synergies for the year. And these results all culminate in a 16% year-over-year increase in free cash flow, 16%, which is just the beginning of our rapid free cash flow expansion journey and the unlocking of massive shareholder value. Listen, we're just past halftime in the game here for 2021 and our team is feeling more confident than ever. So we're increasing our guidance expectations across the board with today's announcement. Net additions, core EBITDA, synergies, capex investments and cash flow outlooks for the year are all being increased today. These results stem from our focus on executing on our three core ambitions that I talked with you about before, delivering industry-leading profitable growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger while transforming our business and positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong brand and the best customer experiences. Let's start by talking about growth. Our 1.3 million postpaid nets were the best in the industry and we continue to lead the industry in postpaid phone growth year-to-date as well, adding another 627,000 postpaid phone net adds in Q2, above our plan and consensus. This include another strong quarter of growth from T-Mobile for business, driven by customer wins in key industries, including airlines, automotive and retail and government agencies such as the Department of Veteran Affairs and the US Army. But importantly, our reliable profitable growth is the product of our progress on churn. T-Mobile again produced the biggest sequential improvement in postpaid phone churn compared to all other wireless operators this quarter, delivering 0.87%. We continue to make great strides in improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences. And we continue to see the lowest churn in the entire industry from our loyalty mobile branded customers. Our T-Mobile brand's consumer churn is lower than Verizon's and this quarter, so is our business journey [ph]. This achievement is a testament to our awesome customer-loving team and also to our synergy-backed model, which allows us to sustainably deliver the best value, while rapidly building fame as America's best 5G network. And unlike the other guys, we've got room to run our higher Sprint churn is rapidly improving, giving us ongoing potential tailwinds in this area. Speaking of our customer-loving team, just this morning, we were awarded the number one ranking from J.D. Power in US Customer Care Performance for the 22nd time. And our Net Promoter Score for customer care among our Sprint customers is up 48% year-over-year. The way we care for our customers is part of our secret sauce and it's important moat around our business. Now with all the line growth we've been seeing in the industry, another strong metric to watch is postpaid accounts, which represents new overall customer building relationships. As we said during our Analyst Day, our strategy is built upon establishing new account relationships and growing them over time with additional products and services to drive ARPA growth. This quarter, we delivered our highest ever postpaid account growth at 349,000 and we continue to focus on capturing quality profitable growth. I'll say it again. This quarter's account growth was our highest ever at least in all the years I've been here. That's over 600,000 net postpaid accounts added year-to-date compared to Verizon, which is still negatives for so far this year and AT&T who doesn't want to share account growth information. In addition, we are a largest prepaid provider in the country. And we're consistently growing and delivering strong ARPUs in this valuable customer segment despite our size and despite the ongoing industry growth of postpaid at the expense of prepaid. In Q2, we delivered 76,000 net adds, which reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.62%. Okay, let's discuss the financial outcomes. One thing that continues to distinguish us as an investment is that only T-Mobile is converting that record service revenue and our synergy-backed model in the industry-leading core EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow growth. What's even more exciting is that we are delivering these results before we begin to fully capitalize on our 5G leadership and before we fully tap into the new market opportunities and underpenetrated segments we've been discussing. Peter will tell you more about our financial results here in a minute, but what I'll say is that T-Mobile showed again today that we consistently deliver smart growth on the top-line metrics, while consistently leading on financial outcomes like core EBITDA and cash flow, pacing nicely to unlock the massive cash flows we outlined in our five-year plan, a plan that promised outcomes we are reiterating here today, built around consistent disciplined market-leading profitable growth. Our opportunities are enabled by the fact that we already have America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. And as we continue to pull further away from the pack with the pace of our network build, we're clearly beginning to differentiate ourselves not just on 5G but on network performance overall. Already this year, seven third-party network report show that T-Mobile customers get the fastest 5G speeds and spend the most time connected to 5G. While others are touching to the work of a single paid consultant to support their network claims, our 5G leadership is showing up loud and clear time and again and reports that are coming from multiple, independent, industry-leading firms that look at real customer usage from billions of device measurements. Now I know we all spend a lot of time talking about 5G and for good reason, but we have also quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, the latest Ookla data shows that T-Mobile customers get the fastest overall network speeds nationwide and T-Mobile swept every mobile category in Ookla's latest report. This is in addition to OpenSignal's latest findings that T-Mobile delivers the best 4G availability. And Umlaut's latest report, which highlights again that T-Mobile has the most reliable network overall. So whether customers are on 4G LTE or 5G, they're covered by a far-reaching and speedy network at T-Mobile. Speaking of far-reaching, did all of you touched Neville's blog earlier this week, he announced that T-Mobile's extended range 5G now reaches 305 million people, that's nearly everybody. And we surpassed our year-end milestone roughly six months ahead of schedule, thanks to the terrific momentum of our team. Think of it this way. Our 5G network covers 92% of Interstate Highway miles across 5G -- across America. With 5G, 92% today compared to just 68% for AT&T and only 51% for Verizon as an example. However, where we are really unlocking transformative experiences for our customers is with our game-changing Ultra Capacity 5G, which as you know, we are rolling out at an unprecedented pace. We already cover half of the US population delivering average download speeds of 350 megabits per second to 165 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G. And we continue to increase both the breadth and depth of our mid-band deployment providing a 50% increase in our customers' average 5G download speeds just since the beginning of this year, according to billions of real-time device measurements by OpenSignal. That's because we're not just rolling out Ultra Capacity 5G to more of the population targeting 200 million people by year-end, but we are also adding spectrum targeting 100 megahertz before year-end, about what AT&T and Verizon will light up sometime next year with C-band combined. We're well ahead in our 5G leadership. But what I hope is also becoming increasingly clear is that T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era, thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum and our synergy-backed model. We're doing just what we've said we would do during the merger process, leading America into the 5G era and doing it without leaving rural areas behind. And this leadership is beginning to really matter to customers. The 5G era is here and seven out of 10 customers say they're excited about it. T-Mobile's 5G network perception is rapidly changing. And just since March, T-Mobile has seen a 25% increase in people viewing us as the leader in 5G. Now at 26%, we're closing in on Verizon's stagnant 35% number on this metric. And we're way ahead of AT&T. And as for business customers, already over 40% of enterprise decision makers think of T-Mobile as a leader in 5G with 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider. Our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for them to choose T-Mobile. This network progress is also helping to fuel the rapid realization of merger synergies and our continued progress on integration. For the second quarter in a row, we're raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved one-third of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network. And this is important. We're now carrying approximately 80% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network. This is all within just five quarters of closing the merger. And as planned, we're also expanding into new and underpenetrated businesses. We commercially launched our broad 5G Home Internet offering at the beginning of the second quarter. We continue to see great customer satisfaction and product demand continues to put us on track for our target of 500,000 Home Internet customers this year even with demand exceeding our supply for modems at times earlier this year. And we're already seeing third-party recognition, including PC Magazine recently publishing it's Readers' Choice Awards, where T-Mobile Home Internet is ranked higher than every single cable provider by actual customers for overall satisfaction and likelihood to recommend. For enterprise and government, our plan is built on taking share in core wireless, and it's well on track as I discussed earlier. But in addition, our 5G network creates a platform for growth beyond core wireless. And we are focused on helping customers realize value from emerging technologies such as private networks and mobile edge compute, which are exciting potential upsides to our plan. We're already in trial programs with major enterprises in these areas, including 12 of the Fortune 50, even though we don't issue empty press releases about it every week. Meanwhile, we're building our best value, best network, best customer experiences formula to smaller markets and rural areas as well, which make up 40% of US households. We've kicked off initiatives to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond urban areas as well as new initiatives and offers. We're already seeing some early success as smaller markets and rural areas drove nearly one-third of our new postpaid account activations in Q2, up from about a quarter last year. The potential here is super-exciting. So, if I get ready to turn it over to Peter to take you through our financials, I want to take a moment to thank our team for delivering another remarkable quarter, delivering the highest postpaid customer growth and service revenue growth in the industry, while translating that into the highest core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth in the industry. We continue to execute our integration playbook to unlock merger synergies ahead of schedule and we further expanded our 5G lead with the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network, planting the seeds for our future success. So, okay, let me turn it over to Peter to take you through the financials and our guidance. Thanks, Jonathan. First of all, Peter, you owe me $100, the first question was in fact about DISH. Let me point out a couple of things. Yes. Let me point out a couple of things about this. One is, I want to make sure people understand, particularly investors understand, that when we presented you our five-year plan, we had already factored in rapid declines for DISH revenue into our plan. And so that's kind of in the run rate. I'll get to it. It could go a little faster than we had thought. But I want to make sure you understand that. We have done that for a number of reasons. One, we can observe a rapid decline in customers over at DISH. And we don't have a lot of knowledge about their operations and so there's no reasons for us to do anything other than drag right on that when we make our plans. And secondly, we took them at their word that they would build a facilities-based network and vacate ours as soon as possible. So all that was built into our run rate, so much so that in our five-year planning horizon, by the end of it, we had substantially taken out all of the DISH revenues in our plans and the vast majority of them by the end of our planning period. Now, it's possible that with this development with AT&T that they will move faster than even we anticipated in moving off our network. And that will open up some both opportunities as well as some gaps in our financial plan. And I want to make sure a couple of things are clear. First of all, we've looked at this carefully and we are here today reiterating every aspect of our five-year plan, both in the medium-term and in the long-term that we communicated earlier this year. And there's a couple of reasons for that. When we look at this, one of the things I've learned in wireless is that every time you've got a good guy coming at you, there's some opposing bad guy you have to manage. Like great growth, it's going to cost you in EBITDA, for example, and you've got to manage that. Or in AT&T's case, billions and billions of dollars in future revenues reversals hung up on their balance sheet. But on the other hand, when you get a bad guy like potentially DISH moving faster off our networks than we thought, it opens up opportunities. One of the things that we see right away is that when they move off of our network, that's going to open up both management attention, but more importantly capacity. And so many things in our plan are predicated on available capacity. Like, for example, home broadband where we don't think we're going to be so much paced by the demand, we're going to be paced by the available network capacity. So there's an opportunity to go faster. Or enterprise share taking, where our ability to put ambitious offers in front of customers is paced by what, available capacity, our ability to bring in new wholesale partners or double down with our existing ones. This is something that ultimately when we look at it, we're not really that displeased, which gets to the core premise of your question because it's going to allow us to do what we do best, focus on our knitting and get after share taking and building this great network. And that's always been sort of the core premise of the five-year plan that we put in front of you. I'll say a couple of things to wrap up. One, we like and respect the DISH team and we are here for them. So, to the extent that they want us, we're here, more or less, it's up to them. We will honor every obligation and continue to honor every obligation that we've made to both them and to the government. And overall, we are going to get after growing our core business and working with our core partners. And we're here today after looking at it carefully to reiterate every single promise that we made to you in our five-year plan. You bet, John. Yes. Let's jump in on both those. And then, I might ask Peter or John to add to it. As for the agreement, one of the things, obviously, to point out -- I think everybody knows this -- is that our arrangement with DISH is a product of a merger remedy package. And it's highly negotiated and it wasn't something that we looked at in our business plan and had built in originally. We planned to operate the Boost business. So it was part of a remedy package. And in that sense, we were sort of thrust together and has to negotiate this. We did have a shorter-term than what we saw -- communicated in the AT&T agreement, but I don't really have much comment on that. I'm not privy to what interactions happen between them -- between DISH and AT&T. I'm very immersed in the interactions we've had with DISH. Yes, it had a certain term. It had it for a reason. Because remember, the remedy package was meant for DISH to get after building their own facilities-based network as fast as possible and to move their revenues and their customers onto that as fast as possible. That was always the intention. And some are asking whether this still enables that or still we'll see that happen or not. I don't know. You'll have to check with them. As it relates to the second question, what we'll see going forward, one of you guys want to jump in? And we still see the upsides that we saw then [indiscernible], very exciting potentially. So as it relates to accounts, this is what I know that everybody's asking this and all of us only have a lens on our own business. And so, we really can't give you all that much to go on. I can tell you a few things. One, as you heard in my remarks that we're making sure that everybody understands where our focus is. And our focus is on growing profitable overall account relationships, 600,000 of them on the postpaid side so far this year. This last quarter, the biggest new account quarter in our history. And accounts are a great metric because there totally new billing relationship, it's probably somebody porting over and they are an important metric. I heard during the earnings season, one of my competitors sort of said, hey, we're focused on quality growth and not all accounts are created equal. And what I would say to that is, but service revenues are. And T-Mobile led again on service revenue growth was 10% normalized for some things last year, 6% overall service revenue growth, the best in the industry. And so, look, there's some prepaid to postpaid transfers going on, there's some deepening of account relationships with [indiscernible]. There's a lot of dynamics, but it's one of the reasons why I want to make sure that you're hearing us focusing on our knitting about growing overall profitable relationships that result in the market's best service revenue and EBITDA growth. Anybody want to pile on and say where things are coming from? Thanks, Craig. You bet. So let's do another one from the phone. And then let's see if somebody scanning the ones coming in on Twitter. We can pick one or two of those if you want to call them out. But first, let's go back to the phone. Hey, Brett. Yes. thanks, Brett. I mean, we have a lot of work left to do. And we're pleased with our progress. We're ahead of schedule. But this next year is a really critical time. And remember, in an integration like ours, there are separate -- we designed this to be able to do separate discrete events when it comes to the migration. One is, when do you migrate the substantial portion of their network traffic? Two is, when do you migrate their account relationship in terms of the core network that they're attached to? Three is, when do you migrate their rate plan through a destination rate plan? Four is, when do you migrate their biller? Because that can be a discrete event. And finally, when do you start telling them their T-Mobile migrate their brand? All of these can be discrete events. And all of them can contribute to churn improvement. By the way, there is some bumpiness. We're actually starting the process long promised of turning down the network on the store side and adding that capacity through the destination side. And that'll create mostly delight, but it will also create some bumpiness. So there'll be opportunities netted out with some pressures. And overall, it looks like a net opportunity to us. But we're entering a really acute stage here over the next 12 months where we will begin doing billing migrations at a faster pace. We'll begin doing brand migrations. The way we serve people with our exclusive team of experts model will be start to ramping -- to ramp up and will simultaneously start turning down those network sites that are not keep sites so that we can start to get you those concrete synergic flows. All those things will be happening simultaneously. And so far, we're just delighted with how it's going. But at the same time, we see lots of opportunity to put an arm around and love those Sprint customers and we're all over it. Absolutely. And one of the ways you can look at that is, when we look underneath that there are different kinds of situations of Sprint customers. For example, people who are happily into device payment plan that was given to them on fair terms and who have a great rate plan, their churn is already remarkably well. And most of their data is on the T-Mobile network. And so, we see that situation in our base. On the other hand, people who have a situation that's less palatable to them from a variety of promotions that had raising prices or the way their device plan work, so they're not in a device relationship with us and they're kind of a jump ball. Yes, those churn numbers are still higher. And our job is to welcome them to T-Mobile with the great taxes and fees included rate plans and Netflix on us and T-Mobile Tuesday's and team of experts care and of course the best 5G network in the country. And that's happening at pace, but we're only working our way through the base. That could wind up being a nice upside, because only closing half the gap. Yes, that's what's written into our plan. What are we seeing on the Twitter before we go back to [indiscernible]. He doesn't do the calls anymore. He's just digital versus digital. Well, let's read it out. So, go to one feed, does the DISH move to see impact free cash flow guidance? No. Why is there only 40-megahertz of 2.5-gig in some markets? When it will be a 100-megahertz or 160 everywhere? Let's talk about that, because how our advantage level translates into not only people covered POPs but megahertz deployed to those POPs to geek out on an old industry term, megahertz POPs. The difference between what we can offer in the next few months versus AT&T and Verizon and then how that translates into years long advantage, it's pretty start. Maybe you can talk about where we are and where we're going. I was expecting a follow-up question. I forgot he is on Twitter. Okay. So good. Let's go back to the phone and we'll get ready for another Twitter one after that. Hi, Phil. Beautiful. We'll turn it over to the leaders of those two business groups. I am just delighted with what we're seeing on T-Mobile for business. It's a big contributor. We outpaced Verizon this quarter, fantastic, even outpaced Verizon on churn. So people wonder whether we're for real and in business. We're for real. Maybe Mike, you can talk about what's driving it, and then we'll flip over and talk about what we're seeing in home broadband. We're talking about blended, not just on the T-Mobile side, but overall -- blended overall. That's terrific. Well done. Your second part of your question, Phil, is about home broadband. And we're just out of the gates. We're really pleased with what we're seeing. Dow Draper leads all of our emerging businesses. And one of the things I'll say to tee up Dow is that one of our early insights is that, it sure does it look like this is going to be about demand. This is going to be paced by network capacity as I mentioned in my answer on DISH by device capacity for a minute here as we recover from COVID, but not by demand. And by the way, the customer experience is pretty exciting too. But Dow, why don't you tell us what you're seeing? One of the things, it's 5G, look, we just -- as a company, we don't believe that 5G is for rich people on postpaid plans. We need it for everybody. And that's really important. And we're moving absolutely ambitiously to make sure everybody gets a chance to see and experience this remarkable network and by the way, with prepaid customers. That's even more important for so many of them because their phone for many of them is their only connection to the Internet. It has to be a great connection. And it's just such an advantage for us to have the nation's leading prepaid brand on the nation's leading 5G network. And we never held back. From day one, we said, hey, that's for you also. And right now, we have an incredible offer for people to switch from booster cricket, it don't seem to be growing at a fast pace to introduce prepaid customers to 5G and not only to give them a great rate plan, but also to give them a brand new Samsung Galaxy 5G phone. And so, it's a fantastic offer, really it's about celebrating this-5G moment and getting people to come see what our network leadership is all about. And I think that's a contributor. That network leadership both on 4G and 5G is certainly a contributor to the lowest churn we've ever seen or anybody has ever seen from a major prepaid brand. Let's go back to the phone. So I'll start and hand it to Neville, then we'll go back to your first question. It's funny, it's the opposite. The question we often get asked is actually the opposite, the converse of years, which is you're building all these incredible capacity, what are the use cases? Tell us please now about 5G use cases? How are you going to fill up all that capacity? And it's really important you asked the question the way you did because wireless home broadband is one of the killer apps of 5G. And that's why I mentioned earlier that anything that frees up capacity to allow us to go faster on this multi-billion-dollar opportunity is a good guy. And -- but maybe we can talk about that whole equation of what you're seeing when it comes to enabling home broadband and other high-capacity applications. Neville? All right. Your first question was about switching and trends we're seeing with churn in the second half. I'll tee it up and hand it to Jon. A lot of this is seasonal. I mean, second half is usually a period with higher switching activity and higher churn. This year, there's the additional dynamic of COVID which is a little bit of a wildcard. But the broad trends notwithstanding Delta variant do look like a continuation of opening up. And then of course in the fall time in prior years, we've generally had big important new phone launches. And if you take all that together, we've made on the guidance to fund our plan to compete profitably, ambitiously, reasonably but to compete in the second half to make sure that we're competitive. But Jon, why don't you say what you're seeing? All right. You bet. Doug. Okay, let's go back to the phone. Terrific. Well, first of all, let me just say on small markets and rural areas. My opinion, I'll pass it to Jon is, we're in the first inning. We're just getting going a lot of these investments around distribution, around a new way of distributing product, around new offers, around reputation where those things take a little bit. It's just at the very first inning. And yet, we're seeing the market respond. So that gives -- that makes us very optimistic. Peter, I think, rightly pointed out that in our five-year plan, we shared with you, there were a number of important upsides. And one of them is, we would hope there might be a chance to exceed our migration from the 13% market share we had today to the destination 20% in the five-year horizon that we communicated to you. I just told you that in this quarter in the first inning, we're seeing about a third of our activations come from those markets, pretty exciting. So -- and John, some of these questions are about okay. What have we accomplished and what's next and what can we expect? Perfect. I think -- there was a question, second part of this question was about synergies. Thanks, Jon. You bet. So we'll go back to the phone and then maybe do we have a couple more on Twitter as well? I have to go. When do I have to go? Okay, great. Hi, Simon. Go to Neville for the first and Dow for the second. Thanks, Simon. All right. So, where we're going now? Last question. I have to go. So we're going to take the last question. Therefore, we'll go to the phone. And operator? All right. Yes. Thank you, Mike. And thanks, Mike, for the question. So, ARPU and really the story of ARPA, I'm very pleased, like I said in the prepared remarks around what's happening with ARPU and really a lot of tailwind that we're still seeing with the adoption of Magenta MAX, which is just really a manifestation, another use case of the power of this network and bringing this differentiated product out into the marketplace and the ability for Jon and team on the consumer side to really translate that into value from an ARPU perspective. So that's a lot of the tailwind that we saw from a value add service on a sequential basis. Just remember, we told you Q1 was going to be the low watermark as we really focused in Q1 on moving a significant portion of the Sprint base into their target rate plans. And a little bit of that will continue throughout the latter part of this year. And of course there's going to be continued investment in terms of expanding account relationships. Because remember this plan is built on ARPA growth, not ARPU growth, ARPU is still confident in less than 1% dilution given all the tailwinds there. And the other part that also is an impact here is business. And you heard about the success in business, business enterprise and government larger account sizes. So you typically see that coming in at a lower ARPU than the average consumer, but also tremendously valuable customer relationships there. So, very happy there. In terms of Un-carrier, I wish I could just maybe I'll Twitter you out exactly what we're going to do from an Un-carrier perspective and when it's coming. But the one thing that's true from this team, maniacal focus on profitable growth, but never losing that entrepreneurial spirit that we have. So there is more on the horizon. I'm sure when it comes to Un-carrier moves. We are not done solving the pain points in this industry, ordinary industries like home broadband. So really appreciate it, Mike. Thank you. And I think, probably with that, we'll have to, at this point, conclude the call. So, thank you everybody for tuning in. It's just an amazing set of results, again, another beat and race quarter for T-Mobile. And we're just very optimistic about where we're going. And very glad that you could spend the time with us. So [Technical Difficulty]."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile U.S. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Welcome to the T-Mobile's first quarter 2021 earnings call. On our call today we have Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risks factors on our -- in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our Q1 results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found on the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. I would also like to note that historical results prior to the second quarter of 2020 represent the standalone T-Mobile prior to our merger with Sprint. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Thanks for being here and May the 4th be with you all. I don't know if you can see us. If you're not watching, we're coming to you live from our T-Mobile Fight Night Octagon here at our T-Mobile headquarters. And I'll tell you it is great to be here in Bellevue with so many of our leadership team members, as we gradually and safely find the right ways to be together in person at work. And even better, we have another great quarter of results to talk about today. Results that show incredible work done by this team as we continue to push T-Mobile even further ahead of the competition, while doing what we do best, putting customers at the center of what we do. We are off to a terrific start in 2021. From accelerating our network leadership, which is fueling customer momentum to delivering merger synergies and expanding our addressable markets for growth. We have again demonstrated that our unique winning formula and balanced approach enables us to grow share while delivering strong financial results. In our increasingly connected world, we recognize our role as stewards of this profitable company and industry, while continuing to use our Un-carrier DNA to bring change to wireless and broadband alike, to disrupt the status quo and ultimately benefit customers. And this quarter was no exception. We achieved our three core ambitions. First, delivering industry-leading growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships. Second, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger and beginning to transform our business. And finally, positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong and getting stronger brand and the best customer experiences. I'll start off with a few highlights. First, T-Mobile led the industry and net add growth yet again, building on our existing fame for superior value and customer service, while making big strides in network perception to fuel our momentum. And we did it while simultaneously delivering better-than-expected service revenues and core adjusted EBITDA. Second, we continued to further expand our 5G leadership to deliver America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network with multiple third-party experts now taking notice and network perception metrics on the rise. This is so great to see because it will translate into overall network leadership as we serve both businesses and consumers. And third, this unmatched 5G advantage is already unlocking new and underpenetrated segments of customers for T-Mobile. We're giving more consumers and businesses the opportunity to experience the best 5G, combined with the best value and delivered from the best team. Fourth, we've been busy this year executing on our growth plan with a number of Un-carrier moves and strategic initiatives. And finally, yes, it's another beat and raise quarter for T-Mobile. We beat expectations with continued customer growth, increased profitability and rapid unlocking of merger synergies, which enables us to raise guidance for 2021 just one quarter end of the year, something Verizon and AT&T were not confident enough to do despite all of their happy talk on their calls. All right. So let's talk about some of these in a little more detail. As I mentioned, we led the industry in total net adds in Q1. We delivered 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 773,000, postpaid phone net adds, and our postpaid phone churn improved sequentially to 0.98%. We've mentioned before how our opportunity to improve the elevated churn from our Sprint base would be a tailwind for our business. And this is already starting to unfold, as we were the only wireless provider to improve churn sequentially as we execute the same worst-to-first playbook that has led us to the industry best churn rates for our T-Mobile branded customers. This quarter's results are particularly important and show that we continue to make great strides improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences, while others in the industry saw their churn rates flat to up from Q4. On prepaid, we delivered 151,000 net adds, which were the highest in three years and reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.78%. As I mentioned, perception is absolutely catching up to reality that T-Mobile is the clear 5G leader. With 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider, and we're extremely encouraged by our perception trends in the quarter. They showed that our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for customers to choose T-Mobile. In fact, the percentage of customers who say T-Mobile is the 5G company has increased nearly 120% over the last just a year-and-a-half. And we saw an immediate uptick in customers switching to T-Mobile with the launch of Magenta MAX, which provides additional momentum for us to continue to outgrow this industry. As you've heard me say before, and I plan to keep reminding you, T-Mobile has the scale and the resources to do something that has truly never been done before, offer the best value and the best network, freeing customers across the country from having to compromise and providing them with our team's award-winning customer service experience on top which is our secret sauce. This opens the door to further penetrate prime consumers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. Another differentiator is that only T-Mobile is operating with a synergy-backed model, which allows us to simultaneously grow customers and profits while also investing big in the business. And with the rapid expansion of free cash flows likely ahead for us, we are positioned to have great strength and flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Okay, now let's talk about those merger synergies and our continued progress on integration for a moment. Last quarter, we shared our initial 2021 guidance to be more than double the $1.3 billion in synergies that we delivered in 2020. Today, we're already raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network to improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved 20% of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and have really hit our stride in the pace of our migration process. In addition, this is important, we're now carrying approximately 50% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network when you include the seamless roaming that we provide those customers to improve their experience. This is twice as much as just last quarter. In Q1, we took another important step forward in our integration process as we transitioned many of the Sprint customers on to our go-forward rate plans. This migration is important for two reasons. First, it brings our Sprint customers closer to having the full Un-carrier experience by giving them the new value proposition with all of the associated T-Mobile benefits. And second, it sets us up for a seamless billing migration in the future. It's important to understand that separating the brand, network, rate plan and billing migrations into discrete events, which can be done at the convenience of the customer and our business plan, that's a unique and powerful feature of our integration approach and one that's already proving its value. As we shared with you on Analyst Day, we're executing our integration playbook to deliver the merger synergies bigger and faster than originally promised to ultimately provide run rate synergies of $7.5 billion, 25% higher than the original merger plan and over $70 billion on an NPV basis. This will enable us to invest in initiatives to maximize our long-term growth and cash flow generation, and to deliver truly innovative transformational experiences for customers for years to come. Those amazing experiences really begin with the network. T-Mobile is already America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. The country has never seen anything like our network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule, and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate not just on 5G, but on network performance overall. With so much focus on 5G, it is worth noting that with this build, we have already quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, our LTE coverage and performance are essentially the same as AT&T and Verizon now across the country. And with that common foundation in mind, our demonstrably lead in 5G really becomes the differentiating factor in overall network performance. This is putting T-Mobile in the pole position to become the only provider with a network that can kick start this new era of connectivity by delivering our ultra capacity 5G to nearly everyone across the U.S. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers coverage across 1.6 million square miles, reaching roughly 295 million people, offering roughly 33% more geographic coverage than the so-called nationwide 5G of AT&T and Verizon combined. About 1/3 more than the two of them combined. But with our rapid expansion of ultra capacity 5G that's our game changer. We're rolling it out at an unprecedented pace to deliver the truly transformational speeds and capabilities enabled by 2.5 gigahertz and above. We brought ultra capacity 5G to over 100 million people by the end of last year. And we've already expanded that to over 140 million people today. And we're well on our way to covering 200 million people nationwide by the end of 2021. That's this year. In the last month alone, multiple independent third parties including Ookla, OpenSignal and umlaut gave numerous accolades to T-Mobile's 5G network based on real customer usage from millions of device measurements. This shows that not only does T-Mobile have the fastest 5G, but -- and this is equally important as you know, T-Mobile delivers dependability where customers live work and travel and umlaut recognized T-Mobile's 5G as the most reliable and the most available. The bottom line is this, we're really starting to pull away from the pack like we told you we would. Last week OpenSignal released their latest report also showing that T-Mobile customers average 5G download speed increased by 23% just since the beginning of the year, while speeds on other networks stayed virtually unchanged. Widening the gap to competitors as T-Mobile now has nearly 50% faster speeds than Verizon and 30% faster speeds than AT&T. This increase is all about our rollout of superfast ultra capacity 5G. And as I said earlier, consumers and businesses are taking notice, as perception is finally starting to catch up with reality. For consumers that is reflected in positive early trends around our Magenta MAX plan, giving customers the industry's only truly unlimited plan, putting the full capabilities of our ultra capacity 5G in the palm of their hand. The early indicators that we see from Magenta MAX customers underscore that the most discerning customers increasingly consider T-Mobile when we offer the right plan that really showcases our 5G network and Magenta MAX customers are taking full advantage of that differentiated 5G network, with usage levels 40% higher than other 5G customers, and a whopping 70% higher than our LTE average usage with more video, music and social media engagement on their smartphones. Okay, listen, I know I've said a lot about our 5G leadership. And the truth is I'm not here to convince you that we're well ahead. I think you know that. What will become increasingly clear is that contrary to what you may be hearing from our competitors, T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era. Thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum, and our synergy backed model. And second, that this will matter greatly to the choices that consumers and organizations make. We have the best portfolio of spectrum and the most mid band spectrum, both today and into the future with our recent C-band purchase, and we're using the latest technologies like massive MIMO and uplink carrier aggregation to unlock the full potential of ultra capacity 5G. The result will be amazing customer experiences that drive brand choices. At our March Analyst Day, we spent some time unpacking the different growth opportunities we see to expand our addressable markets through new or under penetrated segments, but we aren't wasting any time as you may have noticed from all of the activity we've announced so far this year. With the rapid deployment of our high capacity 5G network, we commercially launched our 5G home internet offering to more than 30 million households at the beginning of this quarter. Meanwhile, others in the industry are still in the planning phases of what wireless home broadband could look like, in the future. For businesses, we saw one of our best ever quarters for phone net adds in Q1. And more importantly, we see increased engagement around how these 5G capabilities available only from T-Mobile in a meaningful way can really benefit their companies. We're bringing the Un-carrier to the business space and breaking down antiquated constructs just like we did for consumers by increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprises and government customers. This includes our recent WFX launch, an innovative suite of products that are ideally suited to help companies adapt to the hybrid workspace of the future with fully featured secured calling and broadband products, and peace of mind of having unlimited data for those customers who've been handcuffed by the pooled data plans from the other carriers. I mean, at a certain level, can you believe that? I mean, we dragged this industry kicking and screaming into the unlimited era for consumers. And yet the carriers are still selling, pooled, shared and limited data to enterprise customers. All that is about to change because of T-Mobile. We've long said that smaller markets and rural areas which make up 40% of U.S households are a major upside for our business. And we've made major progress there as well as a result of all of our focus. But now we're kicking it all into a higher gear. This quarter, we kicked off plans to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond our urban areas, including our innovative new hometown experts distribution model. This will create 7,500 new jobs in small towns and rural communities over the next few years, many of them beginning to be filled this year. And we announced that we're building on our decade long relationship with Google to give customers a broad range of premium pixel devices, a great messaging experience on Android, which is so needed, and the evolution of our TVision initiative to offer YouTube TV as our premium cable alternative product on our TVision platform. So as I get ready to turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials, I do want to just take a moment to thank our team for delivering just a remarkable quarter, while operating in the pandemic and weathering so much uncertainty. We continued to overcome these challenges and delivered the highest total customer growth in the industry, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. We continue to execute our unique integration approach to unlock merger synergies. And we continued to offer the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network as backed by multiple third parties. And the thing is customers are just starting to notice. With positive momentum on our network perception and many initiatives we have launched across multiple customer segments, we are well-positioned to continue profitably growing over time, and to deliver on our mission to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. Okay, now, let me turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials and our guidance. Take it away, Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can tell, this team is firing on all cylinders. We kicked off 2021 with strong Q1 results and good momentum across the business as we look at our expectations for the full year. We executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q1. So let's briefly touch on these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Cost of services of $3.4 billion reflects the continued volume of site upgrades to support the rapid deployment of our 5G network with lower merger related costs than last quarter as the timing of these costs will vary each quarter. SG&A expenses were $4.8 billion as we advance our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $933 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.74 were both better than consensus expectations, and included merger related costs of $220 million or $0.18 per share on an after-tax basis. Our Q1 effective tax rate amounted to 20.9%, which reflects Q1 rate benefits from stock-based compensation. Core adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 billion, driven by continued service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.7 billion, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest amounted to $3.2 billion as we continue to aggressively invest in the build out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow amounted to $1.3 billion, which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $277 million and increased over Q4 driven by our strong operating performance. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account was $133.91 and our postpaid account net additions were nearly double what we saw in Q4. Meanwhile, postpaid phone ARPU was 4,730 in line with our guidance of a roughly 1% sequential decline as a result of lower Sprint customer ARPU arising from rate plan migrations, growing lines per account, and lower late and reconnect fees with improving customer payments activity. With the great momentum in the business, we now expect Q1 to be the low watermark for ARPU this year. And for ARPU to be above Q1 levels for the remainder of 2021 and be within less than a 1% dilution compared to 2020 on a full year basis. Taking a look at our financing activity. In January, we issued 3 billion of senior notes that set record low yields for 5-year, 8-year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year unsecured notes below 3%. Then in March, we issued 3.8 billion of senior notes at an average interest rate of 3.18%, which also allowed us to redeem 2 billion of our 6.5% senior notes, continuing our opportunistic approach to drive down our cost of debt. Also in Q1, we paid $8.9 billion related to our C-band spectrum purchases funded by cash on hand from some pre-funding we had done in Q4 and a portion from our financing in Q1. This excludes our estimated C-band relocation expenses of $1.2 billion, which will be paid over time through 2024. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raised quarter from T-Mobile. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed, while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 4.4 million and 4.9 million, up from our original guidance of 4 million and 4.7 million, reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth, building on our current momentum, and the share taking opportunities anticipated in the second half of the year, with an increasing switching environment. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion, an increase from our original guidance range of $22.6 billion to $23.1 billion, primarily driven by higher merger synergies, along with customer and ARPU growth. This assumes a continued reduction in leasing revenues now expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for the year versus original expectations between $3.8 billion and $4.0 billion, driven by a faster transition off leases and fewer device step ups on older lease promotions. Merger related costs not Included in core adjusted EBITDA are now expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes, primarily driven by network activities compared to original expectations of between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes. These costs will continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, as you saw in Q1 relative to Q4. And we expect a significant sequential increase in Q2 and again in Q3. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, up from our original guidance of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment including capitalized interest to be at the high-end of the original guidance range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continued robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, higher than prior guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. We continue to expect full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we expect higher merger synergies in 2021 of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, compared to our original expectations of between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion driven by strong execution of our merger integration. All together, our momentum and execution gives us confidence in 2021, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock the significant expansion and future free cash flow. We're excited about the mid and long-term guidance that we shared with you at our Analyst Day with massive free cash flow generation and free cash flow margins on service revenue better than our peers. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for shareholders, including substantial potential share repurchases ahead. All right, enough for me, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from John Hodulik with UBS.\nMike Sievert: Hi, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Hey, how are you guys doing?\nMike Sievert: Great.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Couple questions. First, industry phone adds were pretty much off the charts this quarter. Any sense on what's driving that? I mean, is -- are the stimulus checks people are getting, you think adding to the growth that we've seen? And then I thought the commentary on the -- on ARPU going forward was interesting. I mean, you didn't give a percentage about what -- how many Sprint customers have been migrated over to T-Mobile plans. But I guess, are you guys saying that you guys are far enough through that process that you expect dilution from that to lessen as we go forward? And then just sort of any commentary on trends beyond that would be great. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. I'll start with the industry trends on nets, and maybe see if Jon Freier wants to add anything. And then Peter, I'll let you address the ARPU question. Some great news in there. Your question, John, kind of got to the answer in a certain way. We saw a lot of industry activity in Q1, particularly in the second half of the quarter that we think was driven economically by there being a lot of money in the economy, stimulus, tax refunds, et cetera. And our competitors think they suddenly got competitive in the second half of the quarter, and they were talking about their sudden momentum, I think they lost sight of that larger picture that there was probably a macroeconomic circumstance that was driving it. And we're really comfortable with that type of an environment when there's cash in the system and less -- environments of less switching and less going on, as you've seen over the past year and our strong performance, we've got a model that's very flexible. But that's at least -- was our read on it. And it's certainly continuing. Q1 is off to a strong start across the board. You heard some of that from our competitors as well. As it relates to looking forward, I'm very confident that we are, in many respects, a return to work company. Remember, we've talked all along that our model is one that relies on switching. And we believe switching will, in the macro sense through the year, will gain momentum. And it doesn't have to be every week and every month, but take it this way. The second half generally, we think will generate more production for us than the first half, just generally, because we'll see more switching and T-Mobile is always a beneficiary of switching. And that's about the economy getting back after it, people getting back into stores. And as we've all seen, that's starting to happen now. But we think more in the second half than the first half. As it relates to competitiveness of the brands and the offers and how we think it's looking out there, I'll turn to Jon, and then I'll turn to Peter on the ARPU question. \nJon Freier: Yes, you bet. Thank you, Mike. Yes, we just continue to be very pleased with our position in the marketplace today. And like Mike said, the first part of the quarter was an interesting part of the quarter because we were coming out of Q4, when you look at the pandemic, the number of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera, et cetera. And then with the tax refund and stimulus money coming into the marketplace, we saw a really good uptick. But one of the big things that we saw too, is that we launched our Magenta MAX plan at the end of February. And what we saw with those two things was, one, really kind of an uptick in terms of the attractiveness of that particular rate plan in terms of people taking that rate plan. But also something that was really a great benefit in terms of people that really value an incredible network experience and value the very best rate plan that they can have in the market. We saw more people switching to T-Mobile during that particular time. So we love our position, we're incredibly confident, like Mike said. We expect to see the second half continue to accelerate and continue to improve. What you're seeing in the pandemic is really kind of a tale of two tales. One, there's some places that have kind of reopened, some other places like Texas and Florida, but there's other huge states like New York and California that are still in the process of reopening. And, of course, as you continue to see that, you will see the switching pool continue to expand. And when that happens, we're always a share taker. We love our position when the competition is at the highest. And Peter, I will turn to you.\nMike Sievert: Well said. So, Peter, the question -- second part of the question was about your remarks. You mentioned that Q1 would be the low watermark for ARPU for the year and we see rising trends through the balance of the year. Why is that?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, a couple things. And I think you had a question on the Sprint base. And it's the majority of Sprint customers that we migrated. And this again, was part of the plan there and as we highlighted in Analyst Day. But there's another element here that's so exciting and Jon just talked about it a little bit. And that is Magenta MAX, which really does two things. One, it demonstrates the power and the capabilities of this 5G network. Mike talked about the usage profile of these customers. And frankly, the take rate has just been amazing, right, great momentum coming off of Magenta MAX. And it does a second thing. It shows you, as Jon mentioned, that there are premium customers that are attracted to this premium network as the perception continues to improve and understanding in the consumer base continues to evolve around just what it is that Neville and team are building. So those are the things that really allow us to get optimism around ARPU for the remainder of the year. And not only ARPU, but remember that the plan here and the growth strategy to unlock all this massive free cash flow is predicated on ARPA growth. And we're equally as excited about ARPA, which we expect to grow during the course of the year as well.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Two, if I may. Starting off with Peter, you've got growing customers, growing ARPU and growing synergies during the year. If I just take this quarter's EBITDA and annualize it, I get the $24 billion, which is above your guidance. Why wouldn't we be looking at at least $24 billion in EBITDA? What are some of the pressures in cost guide that would offset that tremendous story on top line growth and synergy capture that we might not be thinking about? And then maybe for Jon, on -- it looks like the lines per account went up a lot this quarter. You grew lines a lot faster than you grew account. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on what's going on at the account level versus the lines per account level that drove the difference in the trend there. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds good. Peter, you want to start?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Let me start. Great questions. So let me start with EBITDA. And I guess it's the story of what have you done for me lately. But remember, at year-end, we definitely talked about all of the initiatives and the investments that we'll be making this year to unlock what we shared with you at Analyst Day. That massive expansion both of core EBITDA, but of free cash flow. And that really begins in Q2. You saw a lot of the initiatives that we put out there, WFX, what we're going to do from a T-Mobile for business investment, smaller town and rural hometown experts to distribution expansion in those areas. Those are investments that are really beginning in Q2. So that's an element of what I would think about from Q1 that doesn't continue into Q2, right, as you're trying to create the run rate because we're making those investments. But I'll tell you, what. From a year, where we're thinking about the investments that lead to the free cash flow targets that we shared with you at Analyst Day, I'll take it, right? It's significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis, even before you consider the fact that last year had significant COVID costs that were out of core EBITDA that have become part of the run rate of the business. So I couldn't be more excited about the trajectory, the continued profitable growth in Q1, already being able to meaningfully increase guidance for you. And all the while making those significant investments for the unlock of that promised free cash flow.\nMike Sievert: Now, I don't know, Jonathan, if you're watching on video, but you can literally see a twinkle in Peter's eye when he talks about the cash flow potential of this business over the next few years. He literally perks up when he talks about that part. And that's all net of an investment year. And it's very interesting your point, Peter, that this is an investment year to get to that cash flow future. And yet, in this investment year, everything is pointing up in terms of the raised guidance that we've delivered across the board or communicated across the board today. So that's a good place to be. Jon, second question from Jonathan was about lines per account, and also what's going on with accounts?\nJon Freier: Yes. So two things here. As everybody knows, we really drive our postpaid phone net adds from two ways. One, from the new accounts that we create from switching from our competitors, and two, deepening our existing customer relationships that we have today. So we saw both of those things in action in a very big way in Q1. First of all, our number of new accounts doubled from Q4, which is just fantastic news and shows you the momentum that's happening in terms of the switching to T-Mobile. And then, two, we had an opportunity to really deepen relationships as well with our existing customer base. One of the things to just to remember is that traditionally our Sprint branded customers, they typically have the lowest number of lines on a per account basis. So we have more opportunity to really deepen our relationships and grow there as well. So we've had a lot of interactions with our existing customers, allowing us to really grow the accounts. And then of course, typically what you see in the tax refund and kind of a stimulus event is a lot of people that are looking to grow their relationship with us. So, we love our approach on both of those and we want to continue to take that forward into Q2 and beyond.\nMike Sievert: And, Jonathan, I don't know if your question was getting at this, might be because our competitors are constantly filling everybody's ears about this, which is and what part of that is free lines? Is there free -- other free lines going on? And the answer is, yes, of course, always has been. And it's a small percentage of our total gross activations, though. And I love the fact that our competitors have decided to focus on this because if they think this is what's driving our success, God bless them. I hope that's what they actually think versus just what they're trying to position with you. But what Jon said is actual paying accounts, total account relationships were up and up big this quarter, 260,000 net new postpaid accounts. And in those accounts, what we saw is customers deepening their relationships with us. And one of the things we've always found at T-Mobile is that when we can give customers something they really value and we can grandfather them on that thing they really value. It's fantastic for churn. And as you know, we were the only sequential gainer in churn this quarter with a decreased churn versus prior quarter and again, the very best churn in the industry on the T-Mobile brands. So churn is a tailwind. And this is one of our tools, giving them something that they value, that they know if they leave, they're going to have to give up. And it's been a part of our game plan for a while. So anyway, I don't know if you were getting at that, but you gave me a chance to talk about it anyway.\nJonathan Chaplin: That's great. I think you just probably got a twinkle in his eye about the $23 billion high-end of EBITDA guidance as well \u2026\nMike Sievert: Yes. Because\nJonathan Chaplin: \u2026 but we can [technical difficulty] more in future quarters. Thanks, Peter.\nMike Sievert: You already know him so well. That's great. Terrific. Operator, you want to take the next one, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, as long as we're on the subject of what your competitors fill people's ears with, they've talked a lot about their porting ratios being positive against T-Mobile. I wonder if you could just talk about what you see, in terms of porting ratios and the competition versus each of Verizon and AT&T. And then, I wonder if separately if maybe we could hear from Mike a little bit about the pipeline for commercial accounts. And I thought that blog post from a couple of days ago was exciting. I'd love to hear more about kind of the sales process and what -- how long the typical sales cycle is to land some of those large accounts, and what the pipeline looks like at this point.\nMike Sievert: Yes, great. Great, great questions. I'll start on the first one. Both of our major competitors are porting very negatively to our flagship T-Mobile brand. And what they get in their telemetry is the combination and so they can't -- they either won't tell you that or don't know. But they're porting very negatively to T-Mobile. And overall now if you look at the overall account growth, as I said, we're growing. Overall, accounts are growing. 260,000 net new account relationships growth this quarter from last quarter. That's across all of our brands, T-Mobile and Sprint combined. And so what that means is that porting at least as it relates to the combination is a bit of a weird artifact, and that's why we haven't been focusing on it recently. And they can't really get a good read on it either because of the data that they're getting. So you got to look at overall growth. And that's how we look at it and we're very pleased. I mean, it's the overall momentum for our business with declining churn is something that we've told you would become a tailwind. And this artifact will start to resolve itself as churn on Sprint dissipates, and that's fantastic. If we can lead the industry and postpaid nets while dragging around this level of Sprint churn, well that's a fantastic tailwind for our business. So I hope they enjoy this moment where they can at least look at one artifact and probably fueled by promotions that actually especially incentive port -- incentivize ports on their own end, because it's going to be short lived. If that makes sense. Absolutely. And, Mike, the second part, what are we seeing on the account?\nCraig Moffett: Commercial.\nMike Sievert: Yes.\nMichael Katz: Yes. Hey, Phil (sic) [Craig]. Great question. I think one of the things that you probably know is, in this space when you're talking about businesses and government agencies, sales and activations tend to be a little bit of a lagging indicator because the sales cycles are long, particularly when you're talking about big, complex, multinational enterprise and large government agencies. So, Mike, at the top mentioned that we had one of the best quarters that we've seen today in T-Mobile for business phone nets. And that really -- that success this quarter really is accumulation of successes from many previous quarters as this team has leveraged this network advantage that's been building, which really started as we got to parity in the 4G area allowed us to really engage with enterprises in a way that we hadn't build those funnels up and start accruing successes like we did in Q1. And what's happened over the course of this last year is we've been able to take now a differentiated network asset, which by the way, network is the key variable that the companies that we're dealing with make their wireless decisions on and really start stacking that funnel with new opportunities. New opportunities that include both companies that we haven't engaged with before and existing companies that we're able to go a lot deeper with. So when I look at our business today, coming off a great Q1, and I look at the funnel, the funnel is in the best place that it's ever been both in the public and private sector and it really gives me confidence of sustained success throughout the year as well as setting us up for success over the next couple of years.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Phil, and thanks for your questions. Sorry, we didn't get to close out with you. Hey, Phil, what's going on?\nPhilip Cusick: I guess following up on my previous question, can you quantify at all what that business phone nets are? And then second, any kind of early read on the home broadband uptake in the first couple of months? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Mike, you want to take the first one? The short answer is not going to be not really, but \u2026\nMichael Katz: Not really, but I will say up significantly both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. And I would say generally better than what you've seen from competitors.\nMike Sievert: And how's broadband going, Dow?\nDow Draper: Yes, thanks for the question. And I'd say we\u2019re 3 -- a little over 3 weeks in post our launch on broadband. And I would say we're as excited as we've ever been about this business after launch. And really what I'd say is after launch, we've seen two things that are very consistent with what we saw when we were piloting. And one is that we have -- but just on a bigger scale, we have customers who are coming to us. In fact, I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who said a customer approached him and said, I had no idea I could get those speeds in our neighborhood. And it's such a great feeling, we're seeing that more and more, especially when you think about our presence in rural and suburban and even many parts of urban America where they just don't have -- people just don't have great choices. They might have one choice, they may have -- might not even have any choice. And the other thing we're seeing too, and I think that was even representative of this example I gave you is we continue to attract customers that don't have a wireless relationship with T-Mobile. And so these are customers with one of our competitors for the wireless service, but they're taking our home internet service. And so as we start to what we love about this business too is that it gives us a ability to establish a relationship with someone who isn't a customer, they get to understand and know our business real well, that gives us a great opportunity to continue to upsell. And I think Mike's even seeing the same thing as he's talking to enterprise customers with this as well. So again, we're just getting started and we're as excited about this business as we ever have been.\nPhilip Cusick: I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about how you pitch this to customers. What kind of speeds do you tell customers to expect on sort of a minimum versus average basis?\nDow Draper: Yes. So what we tell customers is and the service we offer is, it's -- on average, customers are going to get speeds over 100 megabits per second. And I think what is great about this too is that we are in many places with those kind of speeds that our competitors, like haven't even gone to yet. And so when you combine that with what we offer, which is really a great reliable service for a great price, no promotions, no exploding promotions, no fees, taxes included, all the things that the Un-carrier does backed by our great customer service, it's a -- we find it's a really compelling proposition for people.\nMike Sievert: I mean, Phil, it sounds like you're shopping, you can go to our easy tool online and see if you're one of the 30 million households that now qualify.\nDow Draper: Just call me, I'll get someone to call you. Take care of you.\nPhilip Cusick: Right guys.\nMike Sievert: Thanks man. Operator?\nOperator: And moving on to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. A couple of questions for Neville, if I could. You disclosed you've taken the network with the mid band up to 140 million pops and now you're up to 325 megabits per second average speed. Perhaps just help us think about how that's going to go through the balance of the year. And maybe if you've got any early data on how many phones are on 5G, what the usage is? And then, that some of the peers have been talking about supply chain, which seems to be getting mixed messages. Any color on that? And perhaps just lastly, Mike on the CDMA network, how you're thinking about the shutdown there at this point?\nMike Sievert: Terrific, Simon. Great questions. Neville, you want to start?\nNeville Ray: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Obviously, we are just delighted with the progress that we're making. We have a ton of network momentum. And if you look at the stats, it's almost embarrassing when you look at some of the competitive stats that are out there, especially when you look at high performing ultra capacity, 5G services that 140 million, I mean, goodness, we're almost at half the people in the U.S covered already. And our competition has not even gone out of the gate. But we're not slowing down, Simon. We're not sitting on our hands -- the pace that we've secured, we intend to maintain and accelerate as we go through the balance of this year and into next. Nationwide goal is right there for us for 2021 to reach 200 million people and speeds will continue to improve. Another dimension to think about on our rollout is not just the scale and geographic mass of that, but also the spectrum assets. And by the end of this year, we'll be committing 100 megahertz on 2.5 to that 5G service and ultra capacity 5G. And think about that, that's as much as AT&T and Verizon picked up in the C-band auction, and their mid band asset portfolio through the end of 2023. So that's just for this year. So we've always talked about speeds hitting 400 megabits per second, plus on average, and that's a target clearly in our sights. And one we would hope to get to by the end of this year. '21 is going to be fabulous. '22 is going to be even better. We're not stopping at nationwide, and we're certainly going to try and increase the gap that we have against Verizon and AT&T now. On supply chain from a network perspective, Simon, maybe this is the advantage that we have, because we started our program so much earlier. And we put massive commitments, multibillion dollar commitments into the market with our key vendors in Ericsson and Nokia. So we're accelerating the pace of deployment. We're deploying more radio gear than we ever have at a pace that's much, much faster than we've seen in our past. And our supply chain deep into the supply chain is very strong at this point in time on the network side. No issues for us there at all.\nMike Sievert: And that's true on the smartphone side, too. We're seeing no supply issues and we're forecasting no supply issues on either network gear or smartphones. I think that's important for everybody to understand. And it kind of dovetails into your last question. As it relates to our CDMA sunset and upgrade of those customers, it's going really well. We're on track to do that on time as we've been communicating at the end of this year, beginning of next year. And a big piece we have to do is we have to migrate all the Sprint customers in order to get there and that's going really well as well. Last month, you saw in our 5G For All initiative, we announced a really awesome unprecedented offer, which is every single Metro and T-Mobile customer can bring any phone, I mean any old phone in to a T-Mobile store and upgrade to a 5G phone for free, totally free. And we're making the following commitment to Sprint customers which is every single customer will be transitioned to a compatible device, or have the opportunity to transition to a compatible device before this upgrade happens at the end of the year. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for a full 5G, 4G rate plan that's compatible with the future. And it's so important that we do this because the digital divide we've seen over the past year and a half is widening. And people who don't have access to the latest technology are at risk of falling behind. So we're full steam ahead on this transition. And we're going to make sure our responsibility is as it relates to our branded customers. And we're going to make sure that every single one of them has the opportunity to be ready for the benefits of this upgrade. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for their rate plan. So full steam ahead and on track.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the questions. Hey, guys. So when we go back to some of those key underpenetrated opportunities talked about, whether it's in the business market or in the rural markets, I mean, really, you're underpenetrated from an account standpoint, you just would have a lower share of accounts in those markets, when I assume you and others, which is why you have a lower share of subscribers. And since the question is, as you gain traction against growing your account penetration in those markets, would it be reasonable to think that your account growth might actually pick up a bit relative to your net adds, because they would be increasingly net adds associated with new accounts as opposed to penetration of old accounts. And I asked that because it would seem like that could be a tailwind for your ARPU as net adds that are associated with new accounts that you believe tend to come in at a higher ARPU. So I'm first, I\u2019m just checking to see whether there's logic to that if there's an offset, we should be thinking through. And then just going back to some of the usage statistics, particularly on the Magenta MAX plan, I'm curious if you're seeing evidence that people were actually using your T-Mobile, mobile devices replacing for their landline when they when they go up to MAX. And I'm just interested in any other insight you might have about what are the use cases that people are using so much more data on their phone as well? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Love it. I'll start with the first one on MAX and use cases, and then we'll flip to -- it sounds like it was business and consumer. I know, Peter, if you have an opinion about account growth and as it relates to ARPU. We are so excited about Magenta MAX. And one of the things that I was just commenting on was how important it has become to get people connected with contemporary connections in this pandemic, that's become so clear that if you're not fully connected with the best and latest technologies, you're at risk of falling behind. Not just falling behind digitally, but falling behind economically. And Magenta MAX is a differentiated offer because it's on a differentiated network. And it's really a showcase that use cases for 5G are already here. We don't have to wait around for the next couple of years for people to invent use cases. They're doing that. And it's exciting, separate topic. But they're here today. And people when you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that's screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it. And it's a truth that's been around since the beginning of the internet in the mid 1990s, when it became popular with consumers, which is we've never been able to outrun the insatiable demand that customers have on the most popular platforms for data. And so when you provide the industry's only true unlimited plan, they do what they do. They use it up in this case with video, a full high def video and smart usage of all the social media platforms and music and other things. And they're also using it for work. And I think what happens is a light bulb goes off, when you provide somebody with true unlimited on a 5G network that's faster than an average Wi-Fi connection, they stop roaming around the world looking for Wi-Fi hotspots. I mean, when I -- we were all about to start travelling, again, to a certain extent, I don't go into a hotel or a conference room and start hunting around for a password for Wi-Fi. I've got a more powerful connection than that already in my pocket. And that's the kind of mentality that Magenta MAX unlocks. It's a real differentiated offer. And by the way, it's only the beginning. Okay. And you were going to talk about accounts and ARPU. So who wants to start on that one?\nPeter Osvaldik: Why don't I start and then, Jon, you can add on as well Mike Katz. But, yes, it's an interesting perspective. And it really is going to depend, I think on the mix of each quarter. You talk -- you heard Mike Katz talk about the success of TFP, right? And particularly as you go into the underpenetrated large enterprise market, you could see -- it could be one account, but have many lines associated with a little bit different dynamic than consumer. I think, as you see, some of the penetration happened in smaller town or rural, yes, absolutely that could happen. But don't forget, we're always going to continue to invest in our existing subscriber base, and particularly as we continue on this journey of worst-to-first in the Sprint churn as well. So it's going to be a mixture. But, yes, there's definitely correctness in that thesis, particularly in smaller town and rural. I don\u2019t know, Jon, or Mike, if you have anything to add to that.\nJon Freier: Yes. I mean, I think you hit it Peter. When you're thinking about large enterprise, both have the dynamics of a single enterprise having really large scaled wireless deployments. And honestly, with a lot of those companies, we already have presence, and we've had presence for a long time, our role has just changed. You heard us talk about this at Analyst Day. Historically, our role was a little bit of a stocking course to create price pressure for AT&T and Verizon. And what you've seen, particularly recently with our growth, is there more and more choosing us, and we're displacing the incumbents for their wireless projects. And so a lot of our growth has come from customers that had technically been customers of ours before, but we're just majorly deepening our relationship with them.\nMichael Katz: Then I would just finish up and say, yes, we are definitely excited about our smaller markets and rural opportunity. And like we talked about at Analyst Day almost 2 months ago, that's 40% of the entire geographic market in the country. And we've got a market share of about in the low teens, and we're trying to get that to -- we will get that to nearly 20% over the next few years. That's for sure. And so like you said, Brett, that that's got a huge opportunity for new accounts, of course, definitely. But just remember one of the things that I said earlier, too, that when you look at our Sprint branded base, that we are going to be migrating more and more to our T-Mobile base that traditionally has had some of the least penetrated number of lines on a per account basis. So there's still big opportunities for us to deepen our relationships with the customers that we acquired through the Sprint transaction back in April of last year. So net of those two things, sure, there's ARPU opportunities for us in new accounts, but there's also ARPA opportunities for us as well as we deepen our existing relationships.\nMike Sievert: Great questions, Brett. Thanks.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nOperator: And moving on to Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Mike.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. The first one was the prepaid churn came down. And just curious if you see this as a temporary change or if you're seeing something fundamental happened in terms of the retention rates for prepaid customers. And then second, lease devices, it looks like it was down from $14.2 million in the base -- $12.4 million in the base in this latest quarter, which is down 13% sequentially. Just curious if you're taking an active approach to quickly reduce the amount of these lease devices in your base and what that steady state mix might look like for T-Mobile between installments and leases in the future. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: I'll start on the first one, see if Jon wants to pile in. It's too early to tell. I think what we're seeing is that our market position for Metro by T-Mobile is exactly what the market is looking for. We\u2019re -- you saw our highest net add growth in 3 years on Metro. We're the leading brand from one of the major network providers. The leading brand, and yet we're still growing. And we're growing in value, too, with churn falling and that's fantastic. It just kind of shows that we have a well-positioned value proposition, I think it's going to turn out to be very prescient that we decided to align Metro around the T-Mobile master brand. Metro by T-Mobile, because as this network investments start to take root, what's really important is that customers -- I said this in my remarks, that customers give us credit for those network investments. And that means they need to know they're part of that network and Metro customers do. As Jon rolls out in smaller markets, we're going to be able to do that in a unified way, which is much more efficient to go after smaller markets with Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile together with unified distribution. And that's fantastic. So we have a more premium offering, that attracts people with a credible and legitimate need to be in this wireless category long-term, not coming in looking and leaving. And that's important. And I think right now in our economy with how much people are relying on their connections, if you're a prepaid customer, that is a very good place to be positioned. I'm not forecasting churn for you. I think that would -- there's so many ins and outs, but I like where we are. I like the overall health of our Metro by T-Mobile franchise. Jon, anything to add to that?\nJon Freier: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, yes, we just really love our early retention rates of our prepaid customers on Metro by T-Mobile as well. This is something that we are seeing that's a little bit different from our offer construct, compensation construct, etcetera. We're seeing improving early survival rates of our new accounts that we acquire through our Metro by T-Mobile brand and product. So we're seeing that which is fantastic news. And then like, Mike said just a few moments ago, we're going to be able to have Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile, all within our T-Mobile stores and smaller markets in rural areas, because it would be extraordinarily inefficient for us to put a T-Mobile store. And then right across the street, put a Metro by T-Mobile store. And like Mike said, Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile they have met. So in smaller markets in rural areas, you should be able to go to one store and be able to get anything and everything that T-Mobile has to offer. So we're looking forward to that as well.\nMike Sievert: And last one on lease devices, Peter, it's happening -- unfolding slightly differently than we had outlook. So maybe you can comment on that.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, well, Mike, really the plan is the same as we laid out at Analyst Day where it's really bringing customers onto the T-Mobile value proposition. And when you think about that mid-term timeframe, the goal was really to get lease revenues down to $1.5 billion and ultimately to be below $1 billion by the long-term targets that we put out there. And it's giving everybody that -- again, the T-Mobile value proposition, all new originations are practically on EIP and taking away the irritant. So there's definitely incentives. We're talking about it with Sprint customers, but it's also on their terms, right to make it be something that isn't an irritant and a churn creator, but to quickly migrate them on to all the goodness that the T-Mobile value proposition has.\nMike Sievert: Operator, before you go out to the phones, I want to ask my team here, we do have some coming in from Twitter as well. Do we want to go to one of those or two or three of those, rapid fire mode? Anything like that? Janice, what's your opinion? You want to talk?\nJanice Kapner: I would I think you got some good ones on enterprise momentum in WFX and on our big Un-carrier move on rural America and distribution and the great American 5G upgrade.\nMike Sievert: Okay. I think we kind of talked about the great American 5G upgrade a little bit, but there is a good question here. So where did it go? Bill Ho, okay. So Bill Ho says since the launch of WFX, that stands for work from anywhere. Can you discuss the reception among the broad business segment? So how's it going? We did the launch. You've made a few comments earlier, Mike. But can you expand on what\u2019s going on?\nPeter Osvaldik: Hey, Bill, good to hear from you. With WFX the reception that we've seen so far has been great and kind of exactly what we expected. One of the first things that we've seen is we expected that bringing a new set of business services to market would enable us to have another dimension in which to facilitate conversations with enterprise and government buyers. And we've absolutely seen that so far. And we've begun the testing process across all the products in there. But to kind of get to the second part of your question. One of the really big pieces of the reception that we've seen is one of the things that's been so appealing about what we launched, particularly the home office internet product, is the fact that it's nationwide. And as businesses are starting to do their planning for a mixed work environment where some employees are going to be in the office and some are going to be remote including in their home, having a single nationwide solution and solutions to help facilitate this mixed work environment has been particularly important for them. And we think that's one of the most exciting things about what we did, particularly with that home office internet product is give a single nationwide broadband solution to enterprise, something that they really can't get anywhere else. So it's going great so far, and I look forward to keeping \u2026\nMike Sievert: That's an eye opener. I mean, when you think about this offering that is available, essentially nationwide, for employers, they really can't get that anyplace else. For their employees not to have to be on an Un-secured Wi-Fi network, sharing the Wi-Fi with the kids to try to do their job. And that's something that we've all seen, what that experience is like over the last year. So that's a breakthrough. Hey, while we got you Mike one more and then we'll go back to the phones. For Jim Patterson, could you comment on the big announcement we made about Lumen and what we're doing, especially as it relates to distributed computing.\nMichael Katz: Yes, really excited about it. And I think the Lumen team is excited too, because as they think about bringing Edge Compute solutions to market, what was important to Lumen, and particularly to the customers that they're looking to bring the solution to is a big distributed, powerful 5G network. And as you heard from Mike, and you heard from Neville earlier, nobody's got a bigger, nobody's got a more powerful nationwide 5G network to bring these true mobile Edge Compute solutions to market. So we're really excited about it and the Lumen team is really excited about it as well. We've already begun engagements with customers. So we're working on some use cases. I expect to have something to talk about that later in the year when those come into market. And we think there's a lot of exciting potential there to really help enterprises transform parts of their business and bring new services to their customers. So more to come on that one.\nMike Sievert: You see what happens, Jim, you asked Mike questions, and he starts to preannounce awesome stuff. So that's -- you're welcome. All right, operator. Let's go back to the phones.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barton with Bank of America.\nDavid Barton: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for \u2026\nMike Sievert: Hi, David.\nDavid Barton: \u2026 questions. Appreciate it.\nMike Sievert: Sure.\nDavid Barton: Hey, guys. So I guess I have a question for Peter on the guidance. And I apologize it's in four parts. So I guess, I heard your comments earlier with respect to the twinkle in the eye for the rest of the year, but specifically with respect to kind of how you change the guidance, how much was related to 1Q versus plan? And how much was related to changing expectations for the rest of the year? And the second question, part two was -- how does the increase in travel and roaming and things that have been happening, I think faster than people expected, impact your outlook, or maybe hasn't yet impacted your outlook. And then part three was at the Analyst Day you talked about Sprint churn in your base case plan going to 1.5%. But with where churn is now relative to last quarter versus to a weighted average a year-ago, it's clear, at least I think that it's not going there. So has that changed yet as a base case? And then finally, part D, If I could was what have you kind of baked into the plan as an outcome from the Verizon-TracFone merger? Thank you. Sorry.\nMike Sievert: Wow, rapid fire mode, Peter. Let's see how you do. Bang him out, all four of them.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right.\nMike Sievert: Yes and no answers.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, no. 1Q versus playing the rest of the year, it's actually both right. It's more momentum in terms of integration and that's why we have the synergy race. But it's also what we're seeing in terms of, of course, customer and the momentum in the business and ARPU that we talked about Magenta MAX. So it's a combination of both that allowed us to update guidance for the remainder of the year, roaming and travel, I would say, I don't know, it's hard to really know. But I will tell you, there's probably no better provider as you start thinking about travel opening back up, roaming opening up when you think about mobile without borders, when you think about what we offer to our consumers in terms of international roaming. The capabilities if you go to Europe or other countries, I would say there's no other provider, that's better. So maybe more and more consumers will see.\nMike Sievert: Probably it hasn't been fueling much of our switching in the last year the way it's been a major contributor in prior years. So that's -- it's a fascinating point.\nPeter Osvaldik: On Sprint churn, I think saying, are we cutting in half? Are we updating the plan? I think we talked a little bit earlier. As we see the country reopening on a more nationwide basis, Jon, spoke to the fact that it's a little bit different than different parts of the region. We do see and anticipate switching to increase. So it's hard to know whether today's level and what we saw in Q1 is really representative or whether some of that switching which again, as the share taker is a real positive for us will impact until we go through the totality of that playbook of bringing them from worst-to-first. So a little bit wait and see there, but really, really pleased with the progress that we're seeing. And on Verizon and TracFone certainly for '21, not I can't speak to when they're going to close other than what they say in terms of external views. But in Analyst Day, we did say that we do assume TracFone, which is roughly about $750 million of high margin service revenue to us would go over a way over the period and likely by the midterm.\nMike Sievert: Well done, not bad.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Dave.\nDavid Barton: Rapid fire.\nMike Sievert: Yes, it work. All right, operator.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Good afternoon. I want to go back to the opportunity in rural America and small market America. You mentioned how there'll be some small town rural experts and distribution picking up. You had originally talked also about increasing rural sites by 10,000. Can you update us as far as how that's going? I've seen some of the comments online talking about coverage out in rural America. So can you talk a little bit about those 10,000 sites to [indiscernible] and over what timeframe?\nMike Sievert: Yes, it's a fantastic question, Ric, because they go hand in hand, right? We go into and really put the distribution and marketing firepower in place once we know, we have an awesome and competitive product. And that's the part that's so rapidly changing. So, I don\u2019t know, Neville, do you want start with this one?\nNeville Ray: Yes, I mean, good to talk to you, Ric. So the rural pieces is huge for us, right? I mean, that's the massive differentiator between what we're doing and if we're honest with ourselves, AT&T and Verizon haven't even announced what they're going to do in rural America with 5G. If you look at that extended range footprint we have today, more than AT&T and Verizon combined, I mean, there is only one choice on 5G in rural America. Today, it's T-Mobile. And we're there materially. You're right, Ric, in the plan as we move through the next couple of years, we intend to add about 10,000 incremental sites to the T-Mobile network. So some sites come off with the commissioning, and we add some additional sites. And that's happening all of the time. There will be several 1,000 added this year. There will be more in '22 and again in '23. So not necessarily an even split. But we continue to improve and enhance coverage across the full coast to coast footprint of the U.S. But in the rural territory, Jon is crazy busy rolling out distribution, and the network is just going from strength-to-strength. And really it's a tremendous upgrade in many parts of the U.S where we're bringing 5G services has been pretty damn awful for many, many years.\nMike Sievert: Ric, one of the things we said in our remarks at the beginning was that this build, which is synergy backed and ahead of schedule, will result in T-Mobile not just having the best 5G network, but the best network with the most coverage. And I think that's important to understand. That's our goal is the best overall network in this country with the most coverage, the most availability, and that that's such an unlock. And for customers, of course, they're just now -- just beginning to understand that this is where we're headed and for 5G, where we already are. And that's such a fantastic potential opportunity and potential tailwind for our business as we go-forward.\nRic Prentiss: Just squeeze one more rapid-fire question. In the past, you've talked about content goes to the internet, internet goes to mobile. It seems like there's an appending now that say mobile goes to cloud. Can you talk a little bit about what 5G network slicing might mean? And can you maybe allude to what you guys see as the opportunity? Is mobile headed to the cloud?\nMike Sievert: Well, first of all, Ric, I'm so flattered that you are quoting us on that, that makes -- that's awesome. Look, the people are asking, what are some of the use cases that will fuel 5G, especially as it relates to enterprise, but you could also say with consumer and of course, it's cloud. And you know, this notion that enterprises don't want to be buying and deploying assets, they want to have networking as a service, they want to have computing as a service. And that does raise very interesting prospects for our business as it relates to being able to ultimately serve enterprise customers with networking as a service. But even putting that aside, which is a fascinating area, that our business model will -- doesn't rely on yet, but that we won't be left behind on. The other issue is that customers, both consumers and businesses alike, as they rely on cloud are going to need very high-speed low latency network for that experience to be good. The more local your compute is, the less your network matters. And the more cloud your compute is, the more your network matters. And people are asking, will T-Mobile's 5G advantage matter as it relates to choice? Or will it be an advantage that customers don't care about our notice? Well, cloud is a differentiator there because the more enterprise customers and consumer applications rely on cloud, the more our network shines, and it really showcases a potential, again, tailwind for the future.\nRic Prentiss: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nOperator: And moving on to Colby Synesael with Cowen.\nColby Synesael: Great, thank you. I think there's an expectation that competition is going to increase. And I think we all think about that fairly generically when we say that. But that's expected in the second half of the year tied to this expectation that switching is going to improve, which you've also are expecting. I'm just curious, what you've baked into your EBITDA guidance in terms of flexibility to respond to that competition to the extent it does show itself and it is aggressive. And then secondly, just a point of clarification. You guys mentioned that you expect ARPU to be up in 2Q versus -- excuse me, 3Q through 4Q versus the results in 1Q. I'm just wondering if that's linear. In other words, 2Q obviously up over 1Q, but is 3Q higher than 2Q and so forth? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Well, Colby, first of all, thanks for the question. It's awesome. You're our last question of the day. Those are great questions. And if you have your pen out, we'll just give you the ARPU figures for the next four quarters. No, I'm just kidding. We're going to start with ARPU, because it's a great question. And then I'll come back to the competition piece. So, Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Certainly. And also how much we baked into EBITDA for promos by quarter, I think all that would be great.\nColby Synesael: They really are great questions.\nPeter Osvaldik: No, they\u2019re excellent questions. No, it's not necessarily linear. There's obviously seasonality. There's promotional aspects. There's other things, there's when investments come, how much of a mix from T-Mobile for business or consumer, but it is a low watermark in Q1, and the rest of the year will be higher than that, but not necessarily linearly increasing.\nMike Sievert: And to your other question, it really goes to our whole philosophy and mentality. Some people who follow us closely, if you look at our track record on guidance, and then our actuals, would be forgiven for saying we're conservative. If you look at our actuals and our track record, and we don't feel conservative. We just feel like we're prudent. And we never know what we don't know. And this is a hyper competitive business. And so what we do is we give you guidance that covers what we think are the most reasonable outcomes. And yes, it may get more competitive this year. And if so, we will execute and perform and deliver on our ambitions yet again. We've been through this journey long enough. And we have a model that's flexible enough. And we have a set of assets and a hand of cards that\u2019s strong enough that if this is a muted environment, we're good. If it's a hyper competitive environment, we're good. We're not going to bring about change like that. We like it how it is now. We think it's serving consumers incredibly well, thanks to the innovations that we bring. But if somebody else brings it, and they do stuff that totally changes things, we're ready. And if we have to be ready, you're hiring us to be ready and we give you guidance that showcases that we're ready. And that's why sometimes it appears conservative when really it's just prudent. And we'll see how this year unfolds. I certainly hope that we will be back next quarter with a beat and race. And that's certainly always our aspiration. And anyway, it's a great question to end on. I appreciate you. And I appreciate all of you. Thanks for tuning in for this. We're celebrating here at T-Mobile. This has been a fantastic start to what I certainly hope and expect will be a fantastic year. Thanks everybody for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile US first quarter 2021 earnings call. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media department. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can tell, this team is firing on all cylinders. We kicked off 2021 with strong Q1 results and good momentum across the business as we look at our expectations for the full year. We executed on our winning playbook and beat expectations yet again in Q1. So let's briefly touch on these great results. Service revenues grew to $14.2 billion, driven primarily by our continued customer growth. Cost of services of $3.4 billion reflects the continued volume of site upgrades to support the rapid deployment of our 5G network with lower merger related costs than last quarter as the timing of these costs will vary each quarter. SG&A expenses were $4.8 billion as we advance our integration efforts and included benefits from increased synergy realization. Net income of $933 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.74 were both better than consensus expectations, and included merger related costs of $220 million or $0.18 per share on an after-tax basis. Our Q1 effective tax rate amounted to 20.9%, which reflects Q1 rate benefits from stock-based compensation. Core adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 billion, driven by continued service revenue growth and synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.7 billion, while cash purchases of property and equipment, including capitalized interest amounted to $3.2 billion as we continue to aggressively invest in the build out of our nationwide 5G network. Free cash flow amounted to $1.3 billion, which was fully burdened by merger related costs of $277 million and increased over Q4 driven by our strong operating performance. Postpaid ARPA, or average revenue per account was $133.91 and our postpaid account net additions were nearly double what we saw in Q4. Meanwhile, postpaid phone ARPU was 4,730 in line with our guidance of a roughly 1% sequential decline as a result of lower Sprint customer ARPU arising from rate plan migrations, growing lines per account, and lower late and reconnect fees with improving customer payments activity. With the great momentum in the business, we now expect Q1 to be the low watermark for ARPU this year. And for ARPU to be above Q1 levels for the remainder of 2021 and be within less than a 1% dilution compared to 2020 on a full year basis. Taking a look at our financing activity. In January, we issued 3 billion of senior notes that set record low yields for 5-year, 8-year and 10-year tranches in the high yield market, including issuing 10-year unsecured notes below 3%. Then in March, we issued 3.8 billion of senior notes at an average interest rate of 3.18%, which also allowed us to redeem 2 billion of our 6.5% senior notes, continuing our opportunistic approach to drive down our cost of debt. Also in Q1, we paid $8.9 billion related to our C-band spectrum purchases funded by cash on hand from some pre-funding we had done in Q4 and a portion from our financing in Q1. This excludes our estimated C-band relocation expenses of $1.2 billion, which will be paid over time through 2024. Okay, let's talk about how this momentum impacts our outlook for 2021 with another beat and raised quarter from T-Mobile. Our guidance reflects the OpEx investments ahead of us in the network and growth initiatives that Mike discussed, while simultaneously delivering on our promise of continued profitable growth. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 4.4 million and 4.9 million, up from our original guidance of 4 million and 4.7 million, reflecting our continued focus on profitable growth, building on our current momentum, and the share taking opportunities anticipated in the second half of the year, with an increasing switching environment. Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion, an increase from our original guidance range of $22.6 billion to $23.1 billion, primarily driven by higher merger synergies, along with customer and ARPU growth. This assumes a continued reduction in leasing revenues now expected to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion for the year versus original expectations between $3.8 billion and $4.0 billion, driven by a faster transition off leases and fewer device step ups on older lease promotions. Merger related costs not Included in core adjusted EBITDA are now expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes, primarily driven by network activities compared to original expectations of between $2.5 billion and $3.0 billion before taxes. These costs will continue to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, as you saw in Q1 relative to Q4. And we expect a significant sequential increase in Q2 and again in Q3. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, up from our original guidance of $13.0 billion to $13.5 billion. We expect cash purchases of property and equipment including capitalized interest to be at the high-end of the original guidance range of $11.7 billion to $12.0 billion as we continued robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, while also realizing procurement savings from our increased scale, enabling our investment dollars to go further. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion, higher than prior guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion, reflecting growth in the strong cash flow generation capabilities of this business, and does not assume any material proceeds from securitization. We continue to expect full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And lastly, we expect higher merger synergies in 2021 of between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, compared to our original expectations of between $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion driven by strong execution of our merger integration. All together, our momentum and execution gives us confidence in 2021, while continuing to invest in our network and the business to unlock the significant expansion and future free cash flow. We're excited about the mid and long-term guidance that we shared with you at our Analyst Day with massive free cash flow generation and free cash flow margins on service revenue better than our peers. We're on track with our plans to unlock significant value for shareholders, including substantial potential share repurchases ahead. All right, enough for me, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone or via Twitter. We will start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please. Yes, a couple things. And I think you had a question on the Sprint base. And it's the majority of Sprint customers that we migrated. And this again, was part of the plan there and as we highlighted in Analyst Day. But there's another element here that's so exciting and Jon just talked about it a little bit. And that is Magenta MAX, which really does two things. One, it demonstrates the power and the capabilities of this 5G network. Mike talked about the usage profile of these customers. And frankly, the take rate has just been amazing, right, great momentum coming off of Magenta MAX. And it does a second thing. It shows you, as Jon mentioned, that there are premium customers that are attracted to this premium network as the perception continues to improve and understanding in the consumer base continues to evolve around just what it is that Neville and team are building. So those are the things that really allow us to get optimism around ARPU for the remainder of the year. And not only ARPU, but remember that the plan here and the growth strategy to unlock all this massive free cash flow is predicated on ARPA growth. And we're equally as excited about ARPA, which we expect to grow during the course of the year as well. Yes. Let me start. Great questions. So let me start with EBITDA. And I guess it's the story of what have you done for me lately. But remember, at year-end, we definitely talked about all of the initiatives and the investments that we'll be making this year to unlock what we shared with you at Analyst Day. That massive expansion both of core EBITDA, but of free cash flow. And that really begins in Q2. You saw a lot of the initiatives that we put out there, WFX, what we're going to do from a T-Mobile for business investment, smaller town and rural hometown experts to distribution expansion in those areas. Those are investments that are really beginning in Q2. So that's an element of what I would think about from Q1 that doesn't continue into Q2, right, as you're trying to create the run rate because we're making those investments. But I'll tell you, what. From a year, where we're thinking about the investments that lead to the free cash flow targets that we shared with you at Analyst Day, I'll take it, right? It's significant year-over-year growth on a pro forma basis, even before you consider the fact that last year had significant COVID costs that were out of core EBITDA that have become part of the run rate of the business. So I couldn't be more excited about the trajectory, the continued profitable growth in Q1, already being able to meaningfully increase guidance for you. And all the while making those significant investments for the unlock of that promised free cash flow. Why don't I start and then, Jon, you can add on as well Mike Katz. But, yes, it's an interesting perspective. And it really is going to depend, I think on the mix of each quarter. You talk -- you heard Mike Katz talk about the success of TFP, right? And particularly as you go into the underpenetrated large enterprise market, you could see -- it could be one account, but have many lines associated with a little bit different dynamic than consumer. I think, as you see, some of the penetration happened in smaller town or rural, yes, absolutely that could happen. But don't forget, we're always going to continue to invest in our existing subscriber base, and particularly as we continue on this journey of worst-to-first in the Sprint churn as well. So it's going to be a mixture. But, yes, there's definitely correctness in that thesis, particularly in smaller town and rural. I don't know, Jon, or Mike, if you have anything to add to that. Yes, well, Mike, really the plan is the same as we laid out at Analyst Day where it's really bringing customers onto the T-Mobile value proposition. And when you think about that mid-term timeframe, the goal was really to get lease revenues down to $1.5 billion and ultimately to be below $1 billion by the long-term targets that we put out there. And it's giving everybody that -- again, the T-Mobile value proposition, all new originations are practically on EIP and taking away the irritant. So there's definitely incentives. We're talking about it with Sprint customers, but it's also on their terms, right to make it be something that isn't an irritant and a churn creator, but to quickly migrate them on to all the goodness that the T-Mobile value proposition has. Hey, Bill, good to hear from you. With WFX the reception that we've seen so far has been great and kind of exactly what we expected. One of the first things that we've seen is we expected that bringing a new set of business services to market would enable us to have another dimension in which to facilitate conversations with enterprise and government buyers. And we've absolutely seen that so far. And we've begun the testing process across all the products in there. But to kind of get to the second part of your question. One of the really big pieces of the reception that we've seen is one of the things that's been so appealing about what we launched, particularly the home office internet product, is the fact that it's nationwide. And as businesses are starting to do their planning for a mixed work environment where some employees are going to be in the office and some are going to be remote including in their home, having a single nationwide solution and solutions to help facilitate this mixed work environment has been particularly important for them. And we think that's one of the most exciting things about what we did, particularly with that home office internet product is give a single nationwide broadband solution to enterprise, something that they really can't get anywhere else. So it's going great so far, and I look forward to keeping ... All right. Yes, no. 1Q versus playing the rest of the year, it's actually both right. It's more momentum in terms of integration and that's why we have the synergy race. But it's also what we're seeing in terms of, of course, customer and the momentum in the business and ARPU that we talked about Magenta MAX. So it's a combination of both that allowed us to update guidance for the remainder of the year, roaming and travel, I would say, I don't know, it's hard to really know. But I will tell you, there's probably no better provider as you start thinking about travel opening back up, roaming opening up when you think about mobile without borders, when you think about what we offer to our consumers in terms of international roaming. The capabilities if you go to Europe or other countries, I would say there's no other provider, that's better. So maybe more and more consumers will see. On Sprint churn, I think saying, are we cutting in half? Are we updating the plan? I think we talked a little bit earlier. As we see the country reopening on a more nationwide basis, Jon, spoke to the fact that it's a little bit different than different parts of the region. We do see and anticipate switching to increase. So it's hard to know whether today's level and what we saw in Q1 is really representative or whether some of that switching which again, as the share taker is a real positive for us will impact until we go through the totality of that playbook of bringing them from worst-to-first. So a little bit wait and see there, but really, really pleased with the progress that we're seeing. And on Verizon and TracFone certainly for '21, not I can't speak to when they're going to close other than what they say in terms of external views. But in Analyst Day, we did say that we do assume TracFone, which is roughly about $750 million of high margin service revenue to us would go over a way over the period and likely by the midterm. All right. Certainly. And also how much we baked into EBITDA for promos by quarter, I think all that would be great. No, they're excellent questions. No, it's not necessarily linear. There's obviously seasonality. There's promotional aspects. There's other things, there's when investments come, how much of a mix from T-Mobile for business or consumer, but it is a low watermark in Q1, and the rest of the year will be higher than that, but not necessarily linearly increasing."

            "content": "Yes, you bet. Thank you, Mike. Yes, we just continue to be very pleased with our position in the marketplace today. And like Mike said, the first part of the quarter was an interesting part of the quarter because we were coming out of Q4, when you look at the pandemic, the number of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera, et cetera. And then with the tax refund and stimulus money coming into the marketplace, we saw a really good uptick. But one of the big things that we saw too, is that we launched our Magenta MAX plan at the end of February. And what we saw with those two things was, one, really kind of an uptick in terms of the attractiveness of that particular rate plan in terms of people taking that rate plan. But also something that was really a great benefit in terms of people that really value an incredible network experience and value the very best rate plan that they can have in the market. We saw more people switching to T-Mobile during that particular time. So we love our position, we're incredibly confident, like Mike said. We expect to see the second half continue to accelerate and continue to improve. What you're seeing in the pandemic is really kind of a tale of two tales. One, there's some places that have kind of reopened, some other places like Texas and Florida, but there's other huge states like New York and California that are still in the process of reopening. And, of course, as you continue to see that, you will see the switching pool continue to expand. And when that happens, we're always a share taker. We love our position when the competition is at the highest. And Peter, I will turn to you. Yes. So two things here. As everybody knows, we really drive our postpaid phone net adds from two ways. One, from the new accounts that we create from switching from our competitors, and two, deepening our existing customer relationships that we have today. So we saw both of those things in action in a very big way in Q1. First of all, our number of new accounts doubled from Q4, which is just fantastic news and shows you the momentum that's happening in terms of the switching to T-Mobile. And then, two, we had an opportunity to really deepen relationships as well with our existing customer base. One of the things to just to remember is that traditionally our Sprint branded customers, they typically have the lowest number of lines on a per account basis. So we have more opportunity to really deepen our relationships and grow there as well. So we've had a lot of interactions with our existing customers, allowing us to really grow the accounts. And then of course, typically what you see in the tax refund and kind of a stimulus event is a lot of people that are looking to grow their relationship with us. So, we love our approach on both of those and we want to continue to take that forward into Q2 and beyond. Yes. I mean, I think you hit it Peter. When you're thinking about large enterprise, both have the dynamics of a single enterprise having really large scaled wireless deployments. And honestly, with a lot of those companies, we already have presence, and we've had presence for a long time, our role has just changed. You heard us talk about this at Analyst Day. Historically, our role was a little bit of a stocking course to create price pressure for AT&T and Verizon. And what you've seen, particularly recently with our growth, is there more and more choosing us, and we're displacing the incumbents for their wireless projects. And so a lot of our growth has come from customers that had technically been customers of ours before, but we're just majorly deepening our relationship with them. Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, yes, we just really love our early retention rates of our prepaid customers on Metro by T-Mobile as well. This is something that we are seeing that's a little bit different from our offer construct, compensation construct, etcetera. We're seeing improving early survival rates of our new accounts that we acquire through our Metro by T-Mobile brand and product. So we're seeing that which is fantastic news. And then like, Mike said just a few moments ago, we're going to be able to have Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile, all within our T-Mobile stores and smaller markets in rural areas, because it would be extraordinarily inefficient for us to put a T-Mobile store. And then right across the street, put a Metro by T-Mobile store. And like Mike said, Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile they have met. So in smaller markets in rural areas, you should be able to go to one store and be able to get anything and everything that T-Mobile has to offer. So we're looking forward to that as well."

            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, Phil (sic) [Craig]. Great question. I think one of the things that you probably know is, in this space when you're talking about businesses and government agencies, sales and activations tend to be a little bit of a lagging indicator because the sales cycles are long, particularly when you're talking about big, complex, multinational enterprise and large government agencies. So, Mike, at the top mentioned that we had one of the best quarters that we've seen today in T-Mobile for business phone nets. And that really -- that success this quarter really is accumulation of successes from many previous quarters as this team has leveraged this network advantage that's been building, which really started as we got to parity in the 4G area allowed us to really engage with enterprises in a way that we hadn't build those funnels up and start accruing successes like we did in Q1. And what's happened over the course of this last year is we've been able to take now a differentiated network asset, which by the way, network is the key variable that the companies that we're dealing with make their wireless decisions on and really start stacking that funnel with new opportunities. New opportunities that include both companies that we haven't engaged with before and existing companies that we're able to go a lot deeper with. So when I look at our business today, coming off a great Q1, and I look at the funnel, the funnel is in the best place that it's ever been both in the public and private sector and it really gives me confidence of sustained success throughout the year as well as setting us up for success over the next couple of years. Not really, but I will say up significantly both on a sequential and a year-over-year basis. And I would say generally better than what you've seen from competitors. Then I would just finish up and say, yes, we are definitely excited about our smaller markets and rural opportunity. And like we talked about at Analyst Day almost 2 months ago, that's 40% of the entire geographic market in the country. And we've got a market share of about in the low teens, and we're trying to get that to -- we will get that to nearly 20% over the next few years. That's for sure. And so like you said, Brett, that that's got a huge opportunity for new accounts, of course, definitely. But just remember one of the things that I said earlier, too, that when you look at our Sprint branded base, that we are going to be migrating more and more to our T-Mobile base that traditionally has had some of the least penetrated number of lines on a per account basis. So there's still big opportunities for us to deepen our relationships with the customers that we acquired through the Sprint transaction back in April of last year. So net of those two things, sure, there's ARPU opportunities for us in new accounts, but there's also ARPA opportunities for us as well as we deepen our existing relationships. Yes, really excited about it. And I think the Lumen team is excited too, because as they think about bringing Edge Compute solutions to market, what was important to Lumen, and particularly to the customers that they're looking to bring the solution to is a big distributed, powerful 5G network. And as you heard from Mike, and you heard from Neville earlier, nobody's got a bigger, nobody's got a more powerful nationwide 5G network to bring these true mobile Edge Compute solutions to market. So we're really excited about it and the Lumen team is really excited about it as well. We've already begun engagements with customers. So we're working on some use cases. I expect to have something to talk about that later in the year when those come into market. And we think there's a lot of exciting potential there to really help enterprises transform parts of their business and bring new services to their customers. So more to come on that one."

            "name": "Dow Draper",
            "content": "Yes, thanks for the question. And I'd say we're 3 -- a little over 3 weeks in post our launch on broadband. And I would say we're as excited as we've ever been about this business after launch. And really what I'd say is after launch, we've seen two things that are very consistent with what we saw when we were piloting. And one is that we have -- but just on a bigger scale, we have customers who are coming to us. In fact, I was talking to a colleague yesterday, who said a customer approached him and said, I had no idea I could get those speeds in our neighborhood. And it's such a great feeling, we're seeing that more and more, especially when you think about our presence in rural and suburban and even many parts of urban America where they just don't have -- people just don't have great choices. They might have one choice, they may have -- might not even have any choice. And the other thing we're seeing too, and I think that was even representative of this example I gave you is we continue to attract customers that don't have a wireless relationship with T-Mobile. And so these are customers with one of our competitors for the wireless service, but they're taking our home internet service. And so as we start to what we love about this business too is that it gives us a ability to establish a relationship with someone who isn't a customer, they get to understand and know our business real well, that gives us a great opportunity to continue to upsell. And I think Mike's even seeing the same thing as he's talking to enterprise customers with this as well. So again, we're just getting started and we're as excited about this business as we ever have been. Yes. So what we tell customers is and the service we offer is, it's -- on average, customers are going to get speeds over 100 megabits per second. And I think what is great about this too is that we are in many places with those kind of speeds that our competitors, like haven't even gone to yet. And so when you combine that with what we offer, which is really a great reliable service for a great price, no promotions, no exploding promotions, no fees, taxes included, all the things that the Un-carrier does backed by our great customer service, it's a -- we find it's a really compelling proposition for people. Just call me, I'll get someone to call you. Take care of you."

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Simon. Obviously, we are just delighted with the progress that we're making. We have a ton of network momentum. And if you look at the stats, it's almost embarrassing when you look at some of the competitive stats that are out there, especially when you look at high performing ultra capacity, 5G services that 140 million, I mean, goodness, we're almost at half the people in the U.S covered already. And our competition has not even gone out of the gate. But we're not slowing down, Simon. We're not sitting on our hands -- the pace that we've secured, we intend to maintain and accelerate as we go through the balance of this year and into next. Nationwide goal is right there for us for 2021 to reach 200 million people and speeds will continue to improve. Another dimension to think about on our rollout is not just the scale and geographic mass of that, but also the spectrum assets. And by the end of this year, we'll be committing 100 megahertz on 2.5 to that 5G service and ultra capacity 5G. And think about that, that's as much as AT&T and Verizon picked up in the C-band auction, and their mid band asset portfolio through the end of 2023. So that's just for this year. So we've always talked about speeds hitting 400 megabits per second, plus on average, and that's a target clearly in our sights. And one we would hope to get to by the end of this year. '21 is going to be fabulous. '22 is going to be even better. We're not stopping at nationwide, and we're certainly going to try and increase the gap that we have against Verizon and AT&T now. On supply chain from a network perspective, Simon, maybe this is the advantage that we have, because we started our program so much earlier. And we put massive commitments, multibillion dollar commitments into the market with our key vendors in Ericsson and Nokia. So we're accelerating the pace of deployment. We're deploying more radio gear than we ever have at a pace that's much, much faster than we've seen in our past. And our supply chain deep into the supply chain is very strong at this point in time on the network side. No issues for us there at all. Yes, I mean, good to talk to you, Ric. So the rural pieces is huge for us, right? I mean, that's the massive differentiator between what we're doing and if we're honest with ourselves, AT&T and Verizon haven't even announced what they're going to do in rural America with 5G. If you look at that extended range footprint we have today, more than AT&T and Verizon combined, I mean, there is only one choice on 5G in rural America. Today, it's T-Mobile. And we're there materially. You're right, Ric, in the plan as we move through the next couple of years, we intend to add about 10,000 incremental sites to the T-Mobile network. So some sites come off with the commissioning, and we add some additional sites. And that's happening all of the time. There will be several 1,000 added this year. There will be more in '22 and again in '23. So not necessarily an even split. But we continue to improve and enhance coverage across the full coast to coast footprint of the U.S. But in the rural territory, Jon is crazy busy rolling out distribution, and the network is just going from strength-to-strength. And really it's a tremendous upgrade in many parts of the U.S where we're bringing 5G services has been pretty damn awful for many, many years."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Thanks for being here and May the 4th be with you all. I don't know if you can see us. If you're not watching, we're coming to you live from our T-Mobile Fight Night Octagon here at our T-Mobile headquarters. And I'll tell you it is great to be here in Bellevue with so many of our leadership team members, as we gradually and safely find the right ways to be together in person at work. And even better, we have another great quarter of results to talk about today. Results that show incredible work done by this team as we continue to push T-Mobile even further ahead of the competition, while doing what we do best, putting customers at the center of what we do. We are off to a terrific start in 2021. From accelerating our network leadership, which is fueling customer momentum to delivering merger synergies and expanding our addressable markets for growth. We have again demonstrated that our unique winning formula and balanced approach enables us to grow share while delivering strong financial results. In our increasingly connected world, we recognize our role as stewards of this profitable company and industry, while continuing to use our Un-carrier DNA to bring change to wireless and broadband alike, to disrupt the status quo and ultimately benefit customers. And this quarter was no exception. We achieved our three core ambitions. First, delivering industry-leading growth by expanding our addressable market and growing customer relationships. Second, delivering substantial enterprise value by realizing merger synergies faster and bigger and beginning to transform our business. And finally, positioning the company for long-term success with sustained 5G leadership, our strong and getting stronger brand and the best customer experiences. I'll start off with a few highlights. First, T-Mobile led the industry and net add growth yet again, building on our existing fame for superior value and customer service, while making big strides in network perception to fuel our momentum. And we did it while simultaneously delivering better-than-expected service revenues and core adjusted EBITDA. Second, we continued to further expand our 5G leadership to deliver America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network with multiple third-party experts now taking notice and network perception metrics on the rise. This is so great to see because it will translate into overall network leadership as we serve both businesses and consumers. And third, this unmatched 5G advantage is already unlocking new and underpenetrated segments of customers for T-Mobile. We're giving more consumers and businesses the opportunity to experience the best 5G, combined with the best value and delivered from the best team. Fourth, we've been busy this year executing on our growth plan with a number of Un-carrier moves and strategic initiatives. And finally, yes, it's another beat and raise quarter for T-Mobile. We beat expectations with continued customer growth, increased profitability and rapid unlocking of merger synergies, which enables us to raise guidance for 2021 just one quarter end of the year, something Verizon and AT&T were not confident enough to do despite all of their happy talk on their calls. All right. So let's talk about some of these in a little more detail. As I mentioned, we led the industry in total net adds in Q1. We delivered 1.2 million postpaid net adds, including 773,000, postpaid phone net adds, and our postpaid phone churn improved sequentially to 0.98%. We've mentioned before how our opportunity to improve the elevated churn from our Sprint base would be a tailwind for our business. And this is already starting to unfold, as we were the only wireless provider to improve churn sequentially as we execute the same worst-to-first playbook that has led us to the industry best churn rates for our T-Mobile branded customers. This quarter's results are particularly important and show that we continue to make great strides improving churn for both our T-Mobile and Sprint customers by providing them with best-in-class experiences, while others in the industry saw their churn rates flat to up from Q4. On prepaid, we delivered 151,000 net adds, which were the highest in three years and reflected record low industry-leading prepaid churn of just 2.78%. As I mentioned, perception is absolutely catching up to reality that T-Mobile is the clear 5G leader. With 5G quickly becoming one of the top things that customers say they're looking for in their next wireless provider, and we're extremely encouraged by our perception trends in the quarter. They showed that our network is increasingly becoming a catalyst for customers to choose T-Mobile. In fact, the percentage of customers who say T-Mobile is the 5G company has increased nearly 120% over the last just a year-and-a-half. And we saw an immediate uptick in customers switching to T-Mobile with the launch of Magenta MAX, which provides additional momentum for us to continue to outgrow this industry. As you've heard me say before, and I plan to keep reminding you, T-Mobile has the scale and the resources to do something that has truly never been done before, offer the best value and the best network, freeing customers across the country from having to compromise and providing them with our team's award-winning customer service experience on top which is our secret sauce. This opens the door to further penetrate prime consumers and businesses that require the highest quality network experience and compelling reasons for them to adopt more premium plans. Another differentiator is that only T-Mobile is operating with a synergy-backed model, which allows us to simultaneously grow customers and profits while also investing big in the business. And with the rapid expansion of free cash flows likely ahead for us, we are positioned to have great strength and flexibility from a balance sheet perspective. Okay, now let's talk about those merger synergies and our continued progress on integration for a moment. Last quarter, we shared our initial 2021 guidance to be more than double the $1.3 billion in synergies that we delivered in 2020. Today, we're already raising our synergy guidance for 2021. This progress includes continuing to migrate Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network to improve their experience, which is key to unlocking synergies. We've already moved 20% of Sprint customers to the T-Mobile network and have really hit our stride in the pace of our migration process. In addition, this is important, we're now carrying approximately 50% of the total Sprint customer traffic on the T-Mobile network when you include the seamless roaming that we provide those customers to improve their experience. This is twice as much as just last quarter. In Q1, we took another important step forward in our integration process as we transitioned many of the Sprint customers on to our go-forward rate plans. This migration is important for two reasons. First, it brings our Sprint customers closer to having the full Un-carrier experience by giving them the new value proposition with all of the associated T-Mobile benefits. And second, it sets us up for a seamless billing migration in the future. It's important to understand that separating the brand, network, rate plan and billing migrations into discrete events, which can be done at the convenience of the customer and our business plan, that's a unique and powerful feature of our integration approach and one that's already proving its value. As we shared with you on Analyst Day, we're executing our integration playbook to deliver the merger synergies bigger and faster than originally promised to ultimately provide run rate synergies of $7.5 billion, 25% higher than the original merger plan and over $70 billion on an NPV basis. This will enable us to invest in initiatives to maximize our long-term growth and cash flow generation, and to deliver truly innovative transformational experiences for customers for years to come. Those amazing experiences really begin with the network. T-Mobile is already America's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network. The country has never seen anything like our network build. We're tracking ahead of schedule, and the results are clearly beginning to differentiate not just on 5G, but on network performance overall. With so much focus on 5G, it is worth noting that with this build, we have already quietly eliminated the legacy advantages that AT&T and Verizon previously enjoyed on LTE, which is where most traffic remains today. In fact, our LTE coverage and performance are essentially the same as AT&T and Verizon now across the country. And with that common foundation in mind, our demonstrably lead in 5G really becomes the differentiating factor in overall network performance. This is putting T-Mobile in the pole position to become the only provider with a network that can kick start this new era of connectivity by delivering our ultra capacity 5G to nearly everyone across the U.S. T-Mobile's extended range 5G now delivers coverage across 1.6 million square miles, reaching roughly 295 million people, offering roughly 33% more geographic coverage than the so-called nationwide 5G of AT&T and Verizon combined. About 1/3 more than the two of them combined. But with our rapid expansion of ultra capacity 5G that's our game changer. We're rolling it out at an unprecedented pace to deliver the truly transformational speeds and capabilities enabled by 2.5 gigahertz and above. We brought ultra capacity 5G to over 100 million people by the end of last year. And we've already expanded that to over 140 million people today. And we're well on our way to covering 200 million people nationwide by the end of 2021. That's this year. In the last month alone, multiple independent third parties including Ookla, OpenSignal and umlaut gave numerous accolades to T-Mobile's 5G network based on real customer usage from millions of device measurements. This shows that not only does T-Mobile have the fastest 5G, but -- and this is equally important as you know, T-Mobile delivers dependability where customers live work and travel and umlaut recognized T-Mobile's 5G as the most reliable and the most available. The bottom line is this, we're really starting to pull away from the pack like we told you we would. Last week OpenSignal released their latest report also showing that T-Mobile customers average 5G download speed increased by 23% just since the beginning of the year, while speeds on other networks stayed virtually unchanged. Widening the gap to competitors as T-Mobile now has nearly 50% faster speeds than Verizon and 30% faster speeds than AT&T. This increase is all about our rollout of superfast ultra capacity 5G. And as I said earlier, consumers and businesses are taking notice, as perception is finally starting to catch up with reality. For consumers that is reflected in positive early trends around our Magenta MAX plan, giving customers the industry's only truly unlimited plan, putting the full capabilities of our ultra capacity 5G in the palm of their hand. The early indicators that we see from Magenta MAX customers underscore that the most discerning customers increasingly consider T-Mobile when we offer the right plan that really showcases our 5G network and Magenta MAX customers are taking full advantage of that differentiated 5G network, with usage levels 40% higher than other 5G customers, and a whopping 70% higher than our LTE average usage with more video, music and social media engagement on their smartphones. Okay, listen, I know I've said a lot about our 5G leadership. And the truth is I'm not here to convince you that we're well ahead. I think you know that. What will become increasingly clear is that contrary to what you may be hearing from our competitors, T-Mobile is positioned to maintain our 5G leadership for the duration of the 5G era. Thanks to our superior spectrum portfolio, our unprecedented deployment momentum, and our synergy backed model. And second, that this will matter greatly to the choices that consumers and organizations make. We have the best portfolio of spectrum and the most mid band spectrum, both today and into the future with our recent C-band purchase, and we're using the latest technologies like massive MIMO and uplink carrier aggregation to unlock the full potential of ultra capacity 5G. The result will be amazing customer experiences that drive brand choices. At our March Analyst Day, we spent some time unpacking the different growth opportunities we see to expand our addressable markets through new or under penetrated segments, but we aren't wasting any time as you may have noticed from all of the activity we've announced so far this year. With the rapid deployment of our high capacity 5G network, we commercially launched our 5G home internet offering to more than 30 million households at the beginning of this quarter. Meanwhile, others in the industry are still in the planning phases of what wireless home broadband could look like, in the future. For businesses, we saw one of our best ever quarters for phone net adds in Q1. And more importantly, we see increased engagement around how these 5G capabilities available only from T-Mobile in a meaningful way can really benefit their companies. We're bringing the Un-carrier to the business space and breaking down antiquated constructs just like we did for consumers by increasing our specialized sales force and building tailored products for large enterprises and government customers. This includes our recent WFX launch, an innovative suite of products that are ideally suited to help companies adapt to the hybrid workspace of the future with fully featured secured calling and broadband products, and peace of mind of having unlimited data for those customers who've been handcuffed by the pooled data plans from the other carriers. I mean, at a certain level, can you believe that? I mean, we dragged this industry kicking and screaming into the unlimited era for consumers. And yet the carriers are still selling, pooled, shared and limited data to enterprise customers. All that is about to change because of T-Mobile. We've long said that smaller markets and rural areas which make up 40% of U.S households are a major upside for our business. And we've made major progress there as well as a result of all of our focus. But now we're kicking it all into a higher gear. This quarter, we kicked off plans to add significantly more points of distribution to reach beyond our urban areas, including our innovative new hometown experts distribution model. This will create 7,500 new jobs in small towns and rural communities over the next few years, many of them beginning to be filled this year. And we announced that we're building on our decade long relationship with Google to give customers a broad range of premium pixel devices, a great messaging experience on Android, which is so needed, and the evolution of our TVision initiative to offer YouTube TV as our premium cable alternative product on our TVision platform. So as I get ready to turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials, I do want to just take a moment to thank our team for delivering just a remarkable quarter, while operating in the pandemic and weathering so much uncertainty. We continued to overcome these challenges and delivered the highest total customer growth in the industry, while simultaneously delivering strong service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth. We continue to execute our unique integration approach to unlock merger synergies. And we continued to offer the nation's largest, fastest and most reliable 5G network as backed by multiple third parties. And the thing is customers are just starting to notice. With positive momentum on our network perception and many initiatives we have launched across multiple customer segments, we are well-positioned to continue profitably growing over time, and to deliver on our mission to be the best in the world at connecting customers to their world. Okay, now, let me turn it over to Peter to comment on our financials and our guidance. Take it away, Peter. Hi, John. Great. Okay. I'll start with the industry trends on nets, and maybe see if Jon Freier wants to add anything. And then Peter, I'll let you address the ARPU question. Some great news in there. Your question, John, kind of got to the answer in a certain way. We saw a lot of industry activity in Q1, particularly in the second half of the quarter that we think was driven economically by there being a lot of money in the economy, stimulus, tax refunds, et cetera. And our competitors think they suddenly got competitive in the second half of the quarter, and they were talking about their sudden momentum, I think they lost sight of that larger picture that there was probably a macroeconomic circumstance that was driving it. And we're really comfortable with that type of an environment when there's cash in the system and less -- environments of less switching and less going on, as you've seen over the past year and our strong performance, we've got a model that's very flexible. But that's at least -- was our read on it. And it's certainly continuing. Q1 is off to a strong start across the board. You heard some of that from our competitors as well. As it relates to looking forward, I'm very confident that we are, in many respects, a return to work company. Remember, we've talked all along that our model is one that relies on switching. And we believe switching will, in the macro sense through the year, will gain momentum. And it doesn't have to be every week and every month, but take it this way. The second half generally, we think will generate more production for us than the first half, just generally, because we'll see more switching and T-Mobile is always a beneficiary of switching. And that's about the economy getting back after it, people getting back into stores. And as we've all seen, that's starting to happen now. But we think more in the second half than the first half. As it relates to competitiveness of the brands and the offers and how we think it's looking out there, I'll turn to Jon, and then I'll turn to Peter on the ARPU question. Well said. So, Peter, the question -- second part of the question was about your remarks. You mentioned that Q1 would be the low watermark for ARPU for the year and we see rising trends through the balance of the year. Why is that? Thanks, John. Sounds good. Peter, you want to start? Now, I don't know, Jonathan, if you're watching on video, but you can literally see a twinkle in Peter's eye when he talks about the cash flow potential of this business over the next few years. He literally perks up when he talks about that part. And that's all net of an investment year. And it's very interesting your point, Peter, that this is an investment year to get to that cash flow future. And yet, in this investment year, everything is pointing up in terms of the raised guidance that we've delivered across the board or communicated across the board today. So that's a good place to be. Jon, second question from Jonathan was about lines per account, and also what's going on with accounts? And, Jonathan, I don't know if your question was getting at this, might be because our competitors are constantly filling everybody's ears about this, which is and what part of that is free lines? Is there free -- other free lines going on? And the answer is, yes, of course, always has been. And it's a small percentage of our total gross activations, though. And I love the fact that our competitors have decided to focus on this because if they think this is what's driving our success, God bless them. I hope that's what they actually think versus just what they're trying to position with you. But what Jon said is actual paying accounts, total account relationships were up and up big this quarter, 260,000 net new postpaid accounts. And in those accounts, what we saw is customers deepening their relationships with us. And one of the things we've always found at T-Mobile is that when we can give customers something they really value and we can grandfather them on that thing they really value. It's fantastic for churn. And as you know, we were the only sequential gainer in churn this quarter with a decreased churn versus prior quarter and again, the very best churn in the industry on the T-Mobile brands. So churn is a tailwind. And this is one of our tools, giving them something that they value, that they know if they leave, they're going to have to give up. And it's been a part of our game plan for a while. So anyway, I don't know if you were getting at that, but you gave me a chance to talk about it anyway. Yes. Because You already know him so well. That's great. Terrific. Operator, you want to take the next one, please. Hi, Craig. Yes, great. Great, great questions. I'll start on the first one. Both of our major competitors are porting very negatively to our flagship T-Mobile brand. And what they get in their telemetry is the combination and so they can't -- they either won't tell you that or don't know. But they're porting very negatively to T-Mobile. And overall now if you look at the overall account growth, as I said, we're growing. Overall, accounts are growing. 260,000 net new account relationships growth this quarter from last quarter. That's across all of our brands, T-Mobile and Sprint combined. And so what that means is that porting at least as it relates to the combination is a bit of a weird artifact, and that's why we haven't been focusing on it recently. And they can't really get a good read on it either because of the data that they're getting. So you got to look at overall growth. And that's how we look at it and we're very pleased. I mean, it's the overall momentum for our business with declining churn is something that we've told you would become a tailwind. And this artifact will start to resolve itself as churn on Sprint dissipates, and that's fantastic. If we can lead the industry and postpaid nets while dragging around this level of Sprint churn, well that's a fantastic tailwind for our business. So I hope they enjoy this moment where they can at least look at one artifact and probably fueled by promotions that actually especially incentive port -- incentivize ports on their own end, because it's going to be short lived. If that makes sense. Absolutely. And, Mike, the second part, what are we seeing on the account? Yes. Hi, Phil, and thanks for your questions. Sorry, we didn't get to close out with you. Hey, Phil, what's going on? Mike, you want to take the first one? The short answer is not going to be not really, but ... And how's broadband going, Dow? I mean, Phil, it sounds like you're shopping, you can go to our easy tool online and see if you're one of the 30 million households that now qualify. Thanks man. Operator? Terrific, Simon. Great questions. Neville, you want to start? And that's true on the smartphone side, too. We're seeing no supply issues and we're forecasting no supply issues on either network gear or smartphones. I think that's important for everybody to understand. And it kind of dovetails into your last question. As it relates to our CDMA sunset and upgrade of those customers, it's going really well. We're on track to do that on time as we've been communicating at the end of this year, beginning of next year. And a big piece we have to do is we have to migrate all the Sprint customers in order to get there and that's going really well as well. Last month, you saw in our 5G For All initiative, we announced a really awesome unprecedented offer, which is every single Metro and T-Mobile customer can bring any phone, I mean any old phone in to a T-Mobile store and upgrade to a 5G phone for free, totally free. And we're making the following commitment to Sprint customers which is every single customer will be transitioned to a compatible device, or have the opportunity to transition to a compatible device before this upgrade happens at the end of the year. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for a full 5G, 4G rate plan that's compatible with the future. And it's so important that we do this because the digital divide we've seen over the past year and a half is widening. And people who don't have access to the latest technology are at risk of falling behind. So we're full steam ahead on this transition. And we're going to make sure our responsibility is as it relates to our branded customers. And we're going to make sure that every single one of them has the opportunity to be ready for the benefits of this upgrade. And not one single customer will be asked to pay a penny more for their rate plan. So full steam ahead and on track. Hi, Brett. Love it. I'll start with the first one on MAX and use cases, and then we'll flip to -- it sounds like it was business and consumer. I know, Peter, if you have an opinion about account growth and as it relates to ARPU. We are so excited about Magenta MAX. And one of the things that I was just commenting on was how important it has become to get people connected with contemporary connections in this pandemic, that's become so clear that if you're not fully connected with the best and latest technologies, you're at risk of falling behind. Not just falling behind digitally, but falling behind economically. And Magenta MAX is a differentiated offer because it's on a differentiated network. And it's really a showcase that use cases for 5G are already here. We don't have to wait around for the next couple of years for people to invent use cases. They're doing that. And it's exciting, separate topic. But they're here today. And people when you give somebody a true unlimited plan on a 5G phone that's screaming fast on the biggest and best 5G network in this country, they use it. And it's a truth that's been around since the beginning of the internet in the mid 1990s, when it became popular with consumers, which is we've never been able to outrun the insatiable demand that customers have on the most popular platforms for data. And so when you provide the industry's only true unlimited plan, they do what they do. They use it up in this case with video, a full high def video and smart usage of all the social media platforms and music and other things. And they're also using it for work. And I think what happens is a light bulb goes off, when you provide somebody with true unlimited on a 5G network that's faster than an average Wi-Fi connection, they stop roaming around the world looking for Wi-Fi hotspots. I mean, when I -- we were all about to start travelling, again, to a certain extent, I don't go into a hotel or a conference room and start hunting around for a password for Wi-Fi. I've got a more powerful connection than that already in my pocket. And that's the kind of mentality that Magenta MAX unlocks. It's a real differentiated offer. And by the way, it's only the beginning. Okay. And you were going to talk about accounts and ARPU. So who wants to start on that one? Great questions, Brett. Thanks. Hi, Mike. I'll start on the first one, see if Jon wants to pile in. It's too early to tell. I think what we're seeing is that our market position for Metro by T-Mobile is exactly what the market is looking for. We're -- you saw our highest net add growth in 3 years on Metro. We're the leading brand from one of the major network providers. The leading brand, and yet we're still growing. And we're growing in value, too, with churn falling and that's fantastic. It just kind of shows that we have a well-positioned value proposition, I think it's going to turn out to be very prescient that we decided to align Metro around the T-Mobile master brand. Metro by T-Mobile, because as this network investments start to take root, what's really important is that customers -- I said this in my remarks, that customers give us credit for those network investments. And that means they need to know they're part of that network and Metro customers do. As Jon rolls out in smaller markets, we're going to be able to do that in a unified way, which is much more efficient to go after smaller markets with Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile together with unified distribution. And that's fantastic. So we have a more premium offering, that attracts people with a credible and legitimate need to be in this wireless category long-term, not coming in looking and leaving. And that's important. And I think right now in our economy with how much people are relying on their connections, if you're a prepaid customer, that is a very good place to be positioned. I'm not forecasting churn for you. I think that would -- there's so many ins and outs, but I like where we are. I like the overall health of our Metro by T-Mobile franchise. Jon, anything to add to that? And last one on lease devices, Peter, it's happening -- unfolding slightly differently than we had outlook. So maybe you can comment on that. Operator, before you go out to the phones, I want to ask my team here, we do have some coming in from Twitter as well. Do we want to go to one of those or two or three of those, rapid fire mode? Anything like that? Janice, what's your opinion? You want to talk? Okay. I think we kind of talked about the great American 5G upgrade a little bit, but there is a good question here. So where did it go? Bill Ho, okay. So Bill Ho says since the launch of WFX, that stands for work from anywhere. Can you discuss the reception among the broad business segment? So how's it going? We did the launch. You've made a few comments earlier, Mike. But can you expand on what's going on? That's an eye opener. I mean, when you think about this offering that is available, essentially nationwide, for employers, they really can't get that anyplace else. For their employees not to have to be on an Un-secured Wi-Fi network, sharing the Wi-Fi with the kids to try to do their job. And that's something that we've all seen, what that experience is like over the last year. So that's a breakthrough. Hey, while we got you Mike one more and then we'll go back to the phones. For Jim Patterson, could you comment on the big announcement we made about Lumen and what we're doing, especially as it relates to distributed computing. You see what happens, Jim, you asked Mike questions, and he starts to preannounce awesome stuff. So that's -- you're welcome. All right, operator. Let's go back to the phones. Hi, David. Sure. Wow, rapid fire mode, Peter. Let's see how you do. Bang him out, all four of them. Yes and no answers. Probably it hasn't been fueling much of our switching in the last year the way it's been a major contributor in prior years. So that's -- it's a fascinating point. Well done, not bad. Thanks, Dave. Yes, it work. All right, operator. Hi, Ric. Yes, it's a fantastic question, Ric, because they go hand in hand, right? We go into and really put the distribution and marketing firepower in place once we know, we have an awesome and competitive product. And that's the part that's so rapidly changing. So, I don't know, Neville, do you want start with this one? Ric, one of the things we said in our remarks at the beginning was that this build, which is synergy backed and ahead of schedule, will result in T-Mobile not just having the best 5G network, but the best network with the most coverage. And I think that's important to understand. That's our goal is the best overall network in this country with the most coverage, the most availability, and that that's such an unlock. And for customers, of course, they're just now -- just beginning to understand that this is where we're headed and for 5G, where we already are. And that's such a fantastic potential opportunity and potential tailwind for our business as we go-forward. Well, first of all, Ric, I'm so flattered that you are quoting us on that, that makes -- that's awesome. Look, the people are asking, what are some of the use cases that will fuel 5G, especially as it relates to enterprise, but you could also say with consumer and of course, it's cloud. And you know, this notion that enterprises don't want to be buying and deploying assets, they want to have networking as a service, they want to have computing as a service. And that does raise very interesting prospects for our business as it relates to being able to ultimately serve enterprise customers with networking as a service. But even putting that aside, which is a fascinating area, that our business model will -- doesn't rely on yet, but that we won't be left behind on. The other issue is that customers, both consumers and businesses alike, as they rely on cloud are going to need very high-speed low latency network for that experience to be good. The more local your compute is, the less your network matters. And the more cloud your compute is, the more your network matters. And people are asking, will T-Mobile's 5G advantage matter as it relates to choice? Or will it be an advantage that customers don't care about our notice? Well, cloud is a differentiator there because the more enterprise customers and consumer applications rely on cloud, the more our network shines, and it really showcases a potential, again, tailwind for the future. You bet. Well, Colby, first of all, thanks for the question. It's awesome. You're our last question of the day. Those are great questions. And if you have your pen out, we'll just give you the ARPU figures for the next four quarters. No, I'm just kidding. We're going to start with ARPU, because it's a great question. And then I'll come back to the competition piece. So, Peter. And to your other question, it really goes to our whole philosophy and mentality. Some people who follow us closely, if you look at our track record on guidance, and then our actuals, would be forgiven for saying we're conservative. If you look at our actuals and our track record, and we don't feel conservative. We just feel like we're prudent. And we never know what we don't know. And this is a hyper competitive business. And so what we do is we give you guidance that covers what we think are the most reasonable outcomes. And yes, it may get more competitive this year. And if so, we will execute and perform and deliver on our ambitions yet again. We've been through this journey long enough. And we have a model that's flexible enough. And we have a set of assets and a hand of cards that's strong enough that if this is a muted environment, we're good. If it's a hyper competitive environment, we're good. We're not going to bring about change like that. We like it how it is now. We think it's serving consumers incredibly well, thanks to the innovations that we bring. But if somebody else brings it, and they do stuff that totally changes things, we're ready. And if we have to be ready, you're hiring us to be ready and we give you guidance that showcases that we're ready. And that's why sometimes it appears conservative when really it's just prudent. And we'll see how this year unfolds. I certainly hope that we will be back next quarter with a beat and race. And that's certainly always our aspiration. And anyway, it's a great question to end on. I appreciate you. And I appreciate all of you. Thanks for tuning in for this. We're celebrating here at T-Mobile. This has been a fantastic start to what I certainly hope and expect will be a fantastic year. Thanks everybody for joining us."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. As you can see, we're here in New York City with the whole senior team. And I am very much looking forward to talking about 2022 and a look ahead to what I think is going to be an even more exciting future. 2022 was a record year for our company. It was our best year ever. We welcomed more customers to the un-carrier than ever before in our history, and we translated this customer growth to industry-leading financial growth, finishing with a strong Q4. Our T-Mobile team delivered at or above the high end of our guidance across the board. 2022 was also the biggest investment year in our history. By accelerating these investments, we rewrote the competitive dynamic on network competition for good, and laid the foundation for a highly capital-efficient run rate business beginning this year. When I took responsibility as CEO almost three years ago, I spoke to you about an opportunity we saw that if we could execute well, we can position T-Mobile to be the first company in our space to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value, breaking a decade forced choice on consumers and businesses. While the results are in, with the latest network awards and we've done it. T-Mobile is not only the 5G leader, but now the overall network leader. And this opens big growth pathways for our future. Along the way, we successfully completed the customer migration and network shutdown faster than planned, while also delivering industry-leading growth in both customers and cash flows through our differentiated and profitable growth strategy. And we launched our most ambitious ESG initiatives ever. Our financial outcomes allowed us to accelerate our network deployments and begin share repurchases earlier than planned. And looking ahead to 2023, we're very confident in our differentiated strategy. In fact, we're on track to meet or exceed all of the aspirations for this year that we shared with you way back at our Analyst Day in early 2021. I'm excited to talk more about all of this today, and let's start with our merger integration. Back when we closed the merger, a few people would have thought that we could shut down the Sprint network faster than planned and deliver the lowest churn in our history at the same time, that's exactly what our team did. We moved all Sprint customers off the network and completed the DCOM of Sprint sites, all within 2.5 years. And not only that, we had our best postpaid phone churn year in the Company's history at just 0.88, and we were the only one in the industry to deliver year-over-year improvement for full year 2022. Diving into network, while T-Mobile has been the clear 5G leader for years, we can now say that T-Mobile has the best overall network in the United States. That is a big statement. For the first time ever, T-Mobile won a clean suite across every single overall network category in Ookla's recent report. And recent data from Opensignal and umlaut also show T-Mobile as the clear leader with over 12 billion data points across these network coverage and performance tests, the facts show T-Mobile is the new network leader. And this brings with it an exciting new opportunity, convincing people that this 30-year force choice between network and value is gone when you choose T-Mobile. This is no small task. But other results show that more and more people are beginning to notice and they're choosing T-Mobile. In fact, our results in '22 demonstrated how differentiated and effective our growth strategy really is. Kind of feels like deja vu. When I think back to this time last year, and everyone was worried about what would happen when industry growth began to normalize. And I sense that's top of mind for everyone again as we enter 2023. Well, let's show up immediately last year. The industry did see lower year growth in the second half. And guess what? Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's SaaS growth year ever, with two of our best core system merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize. We posted a record 1.4 million postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry once again. We're winning the highest share of switching decisions in the industry through our clear growth strategies. And we delivered our highest-ever postpaid net adds of over $6.4 million, above the high end of our recently raised guidance. This included our highest postpaid fund net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 3.1 million. We explained it before. Our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in places where we're massively underpenetrated relative to the competition and where we now have the winning hand. Including T-Mobile for Business, where we just delivered one of our highest ever phone net adds quarters in Q4. And we're clearly having an impact on the incumbents. As you can see in Verizon's highest-ever business churn in 2022. In the top 100 markets for consumer, we're winning with prime network seekers who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs and at a lower cost. We're only beginning to tap into this new opportunity. And in smaller markets in rural areas, where we're bringing a better value proposition and a better network to new geographies, we really didn't play in before. We're capturing a win share of switchers in the high 30s, which says a lot because in many of these places, we're only just getting started. In addition, we added 2 million high-speed Internet customers in our first full year since our commercial launch. In fact, T-Mobile had more broadband net adds in '22 that AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. This is a powerful new phenomenon for our brand in addition to being a good business. And not only did we deliver industry-leading customer growth, but our focus on profitable growth translated into industry best financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and free cash flow up 36%. The investments we've made in 2022, including in our cybersecurity capabilities showed up in a critical way a few weeks ago. I want to take a moment to address the recent cyber incident. After address identifying a criminal attempt to access our data through an API, we shut it down within 24 hours. And more importantly, our systems and policies protected the most sensitive kinds of customer data from being accessed. We take this issue very seriously. Find disappointed that the crime actor will be able to obtain any customer information, we are confident that our aggressive cybersecurity plan working with the support of some of the world's experts will allow us to achieve our goal of becoming second-to-none in this area. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a more connected and sustainable future. Nearly three years ago, we launched our digital divide initiative called Project 10Million to bring connectivity to underserved students nationwide with free or highly subsidized service. And I am proud to say we're now more than halfway to achieving our goal. To date, we've provided $4.8 billion in services and connected more than 5.3 million students, and we're not slowing down. We're also working hard to create a more sustainable future, recently committing to our most ambitious sustainability goal yet to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040. This makes T-Mobile one of the only four Fortune 100 companies to do so. Our work in this space is being recognized, including being named in the top 20 of JUST Capital's 2023 rankings, which measures companies against metrics that matter to our communities, including environmental impact, where we ranked number one in our industry. Okay. Let me wrap up with some comments on 2023 and what's ahead. With these record results, we've clearly shown that our differentiated strategy has lots of room to run. And I strongly believe that this will prove to be the case even as industry as a whole is seeing moderating growth and potentially a challenging macroeconomic environment. In fact, it may be especially true in that case as our unique high-quality positioning is proving remarkably well suited to the times. We believe 2023 will also be a year in which we begin to see the payoff. In terms of EBITDA and massive cash flow expansion of years of work on merger integration, synergy attainment and the most ambitious network build in U.S. history, all of which are mostly behind us now. And an ongoing differentiated profitable growth, which is the durable result in front of us. I could not be more proud of this team and our employees, and I am so excited for all that's ahead in 2023 and beyond. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and our guidance for 2023.\nPeter Osvaldik: Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our 2022 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating the moderation while leveraging our network leadership to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. This translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 8% in 2022. We delivered core adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 billion, up 12% and reaching a record high and at the high end of our recently raised guidance. We realized approximately $6 billion of synergies in 2022 or roughly the total run rate synergies expected in our original merger plan in 2018. Our strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022. This strong financial performance allowed us to commence our share buybacks ahead of our original 2023 time line. We repurchased 16.5 million shares for $2.3 billion in Q4, bringing the cumulative total repurchase to $21.4 million shares for $3 billion in 2022. This is such an exciting start to this opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value. So let's talk about how our great execution and investments in '22 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2023. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated growth strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to be down versus 2022. This guidance assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from fans. That profitable growth leads to core adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion, or up 10% midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies and above our Analyst Day guidance for 2023. This excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to between $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching a full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule. And thanks to great execution by the teams. We not only delivered accelerated synergies, but now also expect higher run rate synergies of approximately $8 billion in 2024, of which approximately $2 billion is avoided cost, which is consistent with the amount expected at our Analyst Day. With the major integration work now behind us, we expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes, and is expected to be front-end loaded with roughly 40% expected in Q1. This is expected to be the last year of material margin related costs from a P&L perspective. And just as we have highlighted at Analyst Day, cash payments related to merger costs have underwent the P&L recognition to date and are expected to invert and be between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 with almost half of that total heading in Q1. Net cash provided by operating activities, including these payments for merger-related costs, expected to be in the range of $17.8 billion to $18.3 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion as we deliver capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. I would expect this to be a bit more weighted towards the first half of the year. Our capital efficiency and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our large tension and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And this also represents a free cash flow service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. Turning now to taxes, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023 and as we continuously win and then deepen our cap relationships. Altogether, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?\nJud Henry: All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?\nOperator: Our first question comes from Craig Moffett with SVB Moffett. You may proceed with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Two questions, if I could. One is, you've now had a number of announcements about dabbling in the wireline market. I wonder if you could just talk about your wireline ambitions. And maybe bridge from that into the role that you think WA plays in making bundled offers. Is that something that you need to have nationally? And if so, how do you think you get there on the wireline side? And then second, just a financial question for Peter. I wonder if you could talk about the pacing of share repurchases. I understand that there's some debt paydown that we always expected the first, now that we're sort of well into the repurchase segment. What does the pace of that looks like over the next couple of years?\nMike Sievert: Well, I'll start, Craig. Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we view the convergence space. And obviously, to the premise of your question, we are competing very ambitiously in this space with more new broadband net additions in 2022 than the rest of the industry combined. So we're very happy with our position, and it has lots of room to run for years to come. But on the other hand, the larger question is whether or not we're doing this for offensive reasons or defensive reasons. And our view is that the market has shown that customers will accept bundles. But it's far from certain weather bundles are something that they will require. And so we're some flank is exposed that we have to protect. We're interested in convergence because we have a lot to offer. And we have a great brand, a great capability, a great team, great distribution and the ability to add value to the space as you're seeing in our present success in home broadband through 5G. So we're very interested in the space. But I'll tell you, we haven't decided whether or not that would translate into augmenting that strategy with a wireline approach. But if we did, it would be because it's a good business. Not because we feel like there's some flank that we have exposed that we need to protect. And so while we haven't made a decision about it, I can tell you a few things that we've decided not to do. And I think that's important for people to understand. I personally have no interest in having some kind of major change to our strategy as a company or the financial outcomes that will go from that strategy or the shareholder remuneration that flows from our financial outcomes. We're on a mission to become the best in the world at wireless. And we're pursuing that mission ambitiously and so far, very successfully. That is the place where the future lies and where we want to be. And I'm interested in delivering all of the financial outcomes that we promised you that flow from that business plan. And the shareholder remuneration and share buybacks that flow from that, and we're not interested in something that would cause a material change in any of that. Secondly, because of that, I think we've looked at it and said, if we got involved we would do it most likely with partners. It would make -- it would just be smart to do it with partners versus by ourselves. And that means purely through a partnership or if we have an ownership stake of some type of some kind, it would be off balance sheet and again, would not be at a level that would have a material change in terms of who we are. And then as I said, we'd be interested in it. If it's something that we could add value and make the market better for customers and make some money doing it, directly for the merits of the business, not necessarily for the merits of how it would attribute to wireless. And that's because consumers are sort of voting with their feet. And so far, we haven't seen a benefit to convergence that really translates into consumer value beyond just a discount. And there are plenty of ways to deliver customers' discounts when you have the superior assets in wireless superior balance sheet and wireless, the best overall network and a tradition of a brand that delivers outstanding value. So hopefully, that helps clear that one up.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And then on share buybacks, Craig, I think the important thing is that the strategy hasn't changed, other than, of course, the ability with the financial performance of the Company to initiate those earlier. And so, we couldn't have been more excited to get that first $14 billion through Q3 approved, and you saw we delivered $3 billion of that in 2022. We continue to have line of sight to the up to $60 billion. And so, nothing's changed with regards to the strategy. We're very excited about the cash flow generation of the business, and the flexibility that, that provides. If you think about shaping, of course, I'm not going to talk about day-to-day or week-to-week shaping for natural reasons. But of course, you've got the growth of core EBITDA coming throughout the years, which gives you financial flexibility. As you know, we're very prudent in just the leverage target that we've set overall. But again, nothing has changed with respect to the strategy, very excited about the free cash flow generation and the shareholder remuneration affords.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.\nPhilip Cusick: I wonder if you could dig into the business growth a little bit. What type of contracts are you signing? Are we -- what's sort of enterprise versus SMB mix? And where do these customers tend to come in on ARPU? We've heard about some free heavy discounting that you've done to win some big contracts. And as it goes to that, as we think about our POP up 1% this year, should we think of ARPU more like flat? Or does that start to drift a little bit lower year-over-year?\nMike Sievert: We'll start with Callie on what we're seeing and then switch over to Peter on ARPA and ARPU.\nCallie Field: Okay. Thanks Mike. So in T-Mobile for Business, as Mike mentioned earlier, we continue to build very strong momentum, which is driven by our 5G network leadership combined with toward winning customer service model. In Q4, we continued to grow our service revenue. We delivered one of our highest ever postpaid so net add performance. We recorded our lowest postpaid phone churn since the merger with Sprint, and we grew our voice ARPU. In fact, we grew strong net adds every quarter in '22 and it's having an impact, as you can see in Verizon's business trend, which was its highest ever levels in '22. And their business to net adds declined sequentially for the last three quarters. We've also achieved five consecutive quarters of business Internet growth. Some of our key wins in strategic verticals, we found in the airline industry, where we've won nine out of 10 major airlines growing our base with these customers by 15% in Q4 alone. In the healthcare industry, we welcome to Ensign here as a using company who's deploying our mobility of a service solution to their 25,000 employees. In banking, large financial institutions are fast adopting on multiline solutions. We won three new logos in Q4 for a total of 24 accounts. In the public sector, we welcome to Chicago PD, Head County, Dallas IST. And even in our Advanced Network Solutions category, we signed on Formula 1, where we're on the last Vegas, be providing powering our operations and ensuring top performance fees. And we also welcomed Bell Resorts, the largest mountain resort operator where we're working together to provide innovative guest experiences, helping meet their sustainability goals and enhance restore operations. And we know why we're laying, it's not a race to the bottom, it's not a bit of the lowest rate of pricing down. We always treat our customers first. And in the modern workplace where CIS, we are focused on productivity digital transformation, even more considered sales. And therefore, it matters that we have a two-year head start in IT network leadership. It matters that we deploy customers drove coverage, and we're differentiated as a superior network an unparalleled service model. I'm going to it over to you, Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Let me just add to that. I think what you heard Callie say is we're competing on quality, by and large, and ARPUs are rising. They rose in 2022 in the business space. And the premise of your question, they're lower than consumer, but they rose in 2022 because CIOs are picking us because we have the best network and the best solutions, and they're interested in what we can bring in 5G that our competitors are behind on. And so, that's I think, very much to the premise of your question. As we go forward, one of the things to keep in mind is that even though business ARPUs are lower than consumer and always have been, and there's no structural change happening there. They are very good. The cost to sell in that area is lower longevity. So, there's plenty of reasons to like that business that are different for ARPU. That's why you got to be careful about ARPU as a guiding metric for the profitability of the business because it's not.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And your question, we're definitely not anticipating ARPU to be down on a year-over-year basis. And probably our guide right now would be generally stable. And that's primarily the mix-driven metric as we just had the continued success in T-Mobile for Business, for example, being a mix-driven metric responders or segmentation approach. But there's been just a this amount of tailwind. We continue to see strength in Magenta MAX take rates in Q4. So as you get further into the year, there's potentially opportunity that we could even see some increases over that. But I'd say right now, generally stable with potential upside later in the year, and we'll see how that develops.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Two quick ones, if I could. First, I guess, following up on the business market question. Could you give some details on the rural market strategy? In the past, you've talked about where you are from a sort of spectrum deployment and distribution standpoint and sort of how well you're doing in terms of penetrating that market? And then on the CapEx guide, about $9.5 billion, is this sustainable level? And for Neville, maybe could you give us a sense for sort of what you have in store for the network in '23? Maybe update us on sort of the spectrum deployment at 2.5 where you're thinking for C-band and the other spectrum deployments as we look out to 2030 and beyond would be great.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, John. Those are two great ones. First, on smart markets in the rural areas, and I'll hand it to Jon. I am so pleased with what's happening here. We set out to do something we hadn't really done at scale before a couple of years ago. And 2022 was a pivotal year due to all of that at scale. We moved from 30% in to 60% of the marketplaces where we're really competing at -- I think we've explained to you before, what we call internally license to play or better. And in those places, the numbers have been placed. So, maybe, Jon, if you can give a little bit of color on how that's going and maybe even some numbers and back it up, and then we'll switch and talk about what's going on in the network.\nJon Freier: Yes. Like Mike said, from 30% one year ago to 60% where we'll keep hitting it just reminded about the size of this market. This is 140 million people across the entire country. It's 50 million households. It's 40% in the U.S. in terms of how we define small markets in rural areas, which is everything outside of the top 100 markets. But this overall business, it's been so fun. My heritage is I started out 25 years ago selling into a market are bringing cell phone service into rural markets, and it's in such times to actually bring usable Internet service, whether it be in your home or the mobile service in dual markets. So it's a very, very fun issue so far. And I got to tell you, our switching is up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And when you look at where we're competing, again, 60% of the markets across all small markets areas, we're on in key areas of Verizon peaking over the leadership position in share of portends across the entire market, so a lot a lot of fun. When you look at what's happening to with high-speed Internet, that's a new for opportunity for us in smaller markets and we are in. About 1/3 of our total HSI, high-speed Internet net adds went out of smaller markets or areas, and that's a big catalyst for us in these particular geographies to be that front door in that consideration. But when you look at -- as been talking about this for a while in terms of not having to make a choice between the great value and a great network, that's never been more important, particularly in these areas that have been underserved for the last 25 years and certainly in the last 10 years from mobile perspective. So, we have a lot of fun doing it.\nMike Sievert: And to see shares switching well into the 30s given that a lot of these places, we really does start, I mean, we have the last many years of experience. And that shows that those customers have a resonance with our brands and with our story and they want in. So, we're very pleased without these markets and consumers in the markets are responding. Terrific, let's go back -- sorry.\nPeter Osvaldik: The second part of his question was CapEx.\nJohn Hodulik: I almost forgot about network.\nMike Sievert: Yes, the CapEx fees where the answer is yes, $9 billion to $10 billion run rate. So that's also we're getting done with that line '23 and beyond.\nPeter Osvaldik: Thanks for the question, John. We're coming off what has been a historic year for network investment in this company. I mean we had an accelerated spend in 2022. And you can see in Mike's opening comments, the results that are coming from that. Our 5G leadership is just not disputed in the marketplace. So that's now translating to overall network leadership, which is just tremendous progress for the business, and I thought a series of great growth opportunities as Jon just outlined in rolling across many other parts of the country too. So, as we look at a sustainable level in '23, we're in a great place because we got the integration effectively complete last year. That was a massive effort, but we're ahead of schedule there. And as we look at the build program on 5G and overall network, we just took great strides. Today, we announced 265 million people now covered with our ultra capacity footprint in the U.S. And that number will be 300 million people covered with our ultra capacity footprint by the end of this year. So we continue to expand that great powerful 5G service across the country. 300 million is a number that neither of our major competitors have even considered announcing a target to reach or to achieve. And in addition to that first part of your question, John, we continue to pain spectrum assets on 5G. I mean, we're a 5G business. We're trying to commit our spectrum, our entire portfolio to 5G as fast as we can. Why, because it's delivering just a tremendous experience to our customers. So that spectrum position today. We have 150 megahertz that are dedicated to 5G, some markets. And that's, I think, currently more than AT&T and Verizon combined having the 5G space. And that number, we've said we're targeting 200 megahertz just on the mid-band spectrum by the end of this year. And so, we've recently talked about how we're not just deploying 2.5 gigahertz. We're also adding powerful PCS spectrum in the space. That's a big part of the program as we move through in 2023. You asked about DoD and C-band spectrum. We have some great assets there. Probably a 2024 deployment plan for us as the opportunity to leverage and deploy that spectrum cleaned up with the FAA, et cetera, but 200 megahertz on mid-band is going to be an industry-leading proposition long before we get to the pentanes. So delighted with the progress, I mean, the 5G network is just unbeatable today across all markets in the U.S. The recent benchmarking clearly demonstrates that. But I think more exciting for the business and especially for the network team is this overall network leadership, something that we've been working way on for, as Mike referenced decades and now is in our hands. So a lot to do, '23 will be a continued busy year for us, but the plan is to extend on that work\nMike Sievert: One of the things you can take away, John, from what Neville just said is that this network leadership story that has emerged has lots of room to run. We said three years ago, that we had jumped out in front on 5G, and we were at least two years ahead of our competitors. And I quoted in two years from now, we'll still be two years ahead of our competitors, and that's exactly what has unfolded if you listen to Neville's statistics, he told you that we're already, as you know, at 265 million people covered by ultra capacity. Neither of our competitors has stated the goal to be there any time in the next two years. In fact, they've stated to go for the end of next year, two years from now, it's less than that. And yet, we're not stopping there. We're on our way to 300 million people this year. But to me, is actually the more exciting part about the future testing you heard from Neville is going from 130 megahertz deployed of mid-band, 150 overall, 130 in mid-band to 200. That's a massive capacity expansion that's happening. Because that's not just factors on the experience you get every day. So far, our medium speeds are 5x faster than just three years ago. Our Magenta MAX customers and you know how Magenta MAX is. They're using 30 gigs a month. These are big advantages versus our competition. In broadband, where we're generating more net adds than the rest of the industry combined, has lots of room to run. And so that's all on the heels of this massive capacity that's not just in the network, that's still coming and within the run rate of the $9 billion to $10 billion in capital per year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Mike, you teed up my question. You said you've got lots of room to run on fixed wireless. Some of the competitors critique the product around limitations on capacity, on speed. So perhaps now you've got a base of customers. You've seen behavior over a couple of years now. We are the learnings? How much market share do you think this product can take? And what's your ability to continue to expand the footprint to continue to expand the capacity of the network? And then maybe just a quick word on macro. You talked about some concerns you've seen, anything on payment patterns or any other cautious behavior yet?\nMike Sievert: Great. Well, first on broadband, it's kind of stating the obvious. When somebody who is a fiber provider. So as you know that product not as good as our product. It's kind of like the people at pointing a finger at the world's best-selling car, Toyota saying, we're faster. We have the faster car. Yes, but Toyota is the world's best-selling car. And that's because -- and if you look in the case of T-Mobile, 5G home broadband because it's perfectly suited to what people want. And although it has less overall potential for capacity than a strain of fiber, which is patently obvious, it's radically simple at low cost. It's transparent. It's portable within tens of millions of households. It has the speed and capacity that allows people to think that they want. And therefore, the net promoter scores are some of the highest in the industry, 10 points higher than fiber, 30 points higher than cable. And most of our customers are coming directly from cable, not just from rural areas or unconnected places or DSO. And so it kind of demonstrates that we've got a product here with the right mix of services to meet people's needs, lots of room to run. When we launched this product, we talked about 7 million to 8 million homes. And as you can see from our numbers, we're tracking beautifully to that. And the question now is where do we go from here? And I gave comments before about whether or not we're looking at ways that could augment that strategy, of course, we are. But that's because we have a winning product and massively expanding capacity to support it. One of the things to keep in mind is that economically, this unlike fiber and cable. This product so far is not burdened by amortization of capital and the cost structure, right? So we're able to take the capital that we deployed through mobile and find places with excess capacity and market broadband there. And those places are rapidly expanding even though we have millions of customers on board now soaking some of it up. We're moving our eligible homes from 40 million to 50 million. And that means that there's 50 million homes out of 140 million nationwide, where tomorrow morning, you applied for service, we'd say, yes. And so that is a big footprint. And we think the product is beautifully suited to the times.\nPeter Osvaldik: I can speak to the question on the macro environment. From a consumer perspective, No, we're not seeing it. Of course, this is an area where we're very cautious. But when we think about just Q3 to Q4, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in voluntary churn. And bad debt was exactly what we laid out in Q2 stable on a percentage of revenue and in fact, actually lower than AT&T or Verizon on those metrics. So, it's something we're looking at and making sure we would closely monitor. As we said, this could also be a moment of opportunity for us because as a consumer set to the extent that you're pressured from a recessionary perspective, from an inflationary perspective, it might make you consider a lot of categories of spend and wireless is being one of those. And at the time you create the consideration moment, you go look around. And again this is the time where not only 5G leadership, but has translated into overall network leadership, coupled with that value proposition just being a fabulous time and it could be a tailwind for us. Again, looking at and making sure we're cautious, but nothing we're seeing right now gives us costs for concern.\nMike Sievert: We're making sure our companies ready for after you know. I mean, but the fact that we saw bad debt moderate from Q2 with inflation for spike surprise consumers last spring. How Q3 and Q4 were lower than Q2. In voluntary involuntary churn was actually lower in Q4 than Q3. Our bad debt rates are lower than AT&T's are for us and showing the quality of our customer base, which has always been a question people had, especially after the Sprint merger. And so, we're signing in the future like everybody else, but we take it as far from a foregone conclusion that very stressful economic times are coming. We're prepared if they are. We're financially prepared. And as importantly, we prepared to serve American consumers that in that situation may be questioning whether they ought to be having a great network at a better value. And we're ready to stand up and serve them if they start questioning whether or not they should be saving money in this category because we are uniquely positioned with our high-quality value positioning for economic times like what might be coming. And so, we're ready in other case, but the emphatic answer to the question is no, we are not seeing it.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks for the color.\nMike Sievert: Yes. So Jud, should we go in between here, should we go up to -- you guys can't see this, but we always have screens pointing at us with Twitter -- Twitter questions, and we'd like to open it up. And I was going to have you call out a couple, but there's one that's from at Magenta. So, they win, they have to have a long -- but it's actually a really good question. It kind of goes to something we've been talking about, which is what's T-Mobile doing to maintain its industry-leading growth, giving cable starting to build momentum in the telco space. And we talked about convergence earlier on. And it's interesting to me that we keep getting this question. We saw cables results coming. I talked about them in Q4. And I would just tell you that it looks to us like cable, who's been in the run rate now for a long time because you had a recent uptick. It looks to us like you're seeing lots of transference in terms of net adds that add to the category, additional adds being printed, et cetera, for customers. New phone numbers being created, people coming over from prepaid as a dynamic. But what's interesting is you see that recent surge in growth from cable, and this is interesting. At a time when every one of the three wireless incumbents experienced better-than-expected churn. So churn was better than expected, for us, it was falling. AT&T was falling in Q4 as well versus a year ago. And at the moment, when cable has for some, well, it didn't surprise us, but for some, a surprise uptick in net adds. And that should kind of tell you a little bit about what's going on. So for me, we look at it as sort of, as you would expect, since this is a contact sport as sort of us against everybody else, right? And so, if I look at the second half of the year, what's interesting is T-Mobile was able to deliver 17% more postpaid net additions in the second half of this year versus last year, while the rest of the industry, Verizon, AT&T, Charter and Comcast combined in wireless, delivered 19% less postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus '21. So in terms of our separation from the market at a time when people ask were doing better and better. Jud, any -- one more on Twitter before we go back?\nJud Henry: Not yet. Let's go back to the line and we'll keep watching. Great.\nMike Sievert: Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. You may proceed with your question.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks for taking the question. You gave really great context on sort of what the market size is for rural and small markets and the fact that you've moved from 30% of that market to 60%. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more context around the business market in terms of like how your market shares have progressed over the course of this year, and what you see the size of the overall market being?\nMike Sievert: I mean, one of the things you heard from Callie before is that Q4 was one of the best net add quarters ever in our history. So, we're really comfortable with where this is -- how this is shaping up. And one of the reasons for that is there are long sales cycles in this market. And we've been at this 5G story longer than anybody else. CIOs are very interested in more strategic engagements than they were interested in a couple of years ago. And now, we're in those conversations, but we're way down the pike in them. So, we're very comfortable with where we are. We're competing extraordinarily well. And to your market share question, we're very much on track for the Analyst Day aspirations that we shared with you.\nJonathan Chaplin: Mike, can you give us the mix of business in fixed wireless broadband?\nMike Sievert: You mean should I disclose that right now as a new fact. I don't think we did we haven't. I think what we've said is, it continues to be the majority from consumer, but you're seeing continued uptick in the business side as just Callie mentioned in growth there. So we see a lot of room to run on the business side as well. And obviously, continued room in the consumer space.\nMike Sievert: I did see some notes on that that kind of got it wrong is that maybe business is what's surging in that area. It's the business is doing well, but it's the overwhelming majority for us is the consumer in that space. Yes. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nBrett Feldman: So, you've been able to sustain very strong post pay net adds throughout the merger integration despite those results being burdened by elevated churn related to those integration activities at certain points in time. And I know it sounds like it seems like a lot of that is behind you, but I'm curious how you think about the levers to drive churn lower from here. I'm wondering, if there's actually any residual benefits from the integration we haven't seen yet. I don't know how important the remaining billing migration may be to churn. And maybe just at a higher level, what type of churn outlook is embedded in your postpaid phone -- your postpaid net add estimates for this year?\nMike Sievert: Yes. First of all, yes, on integration, there's more room to run. But principally, I think most of the room to run comes from value network, service brand. And look, we've been through this journey. We drove the Magenta brand to the best churning brand in this industry. And I certainly won't be satisfied until T-Mobile blended postpaid is the best churning brand in this industry. And that shows you we've got some room to run because while we're the most improved, which is a great price, we're not the best yet. And so that's where we're going. That's the goal. And it is, of course, there's some room to run on integration. But we're not separating it for you anymore because it's very hard to chop up at this point. All the customers are on the destination network. Some of them are on the destination biller. It's not that determinative anymore as to which biller you have because we try to make that biller sort of very opaque to you and not transparent. You're called T-Mobile in many cases. So it's -- it's just hard to chop it up now. But yes, there's still room to run to get people settled into fantastic rate plans, both on their device as well as on their service and to feel very careful with clear transparent services. But I'd say the bigger opportunity is our worst to first game plan that we know how to execute, which is give people a great gives them un-carrier moves that allow them to voice that deal and express in vote for T-Mobile. Give them the best network bar not, give them a fantastic path to great devices. Give them a brand that's famous for caring for them and the best customer service in the industry. That's why our net promoter scores are the highest in the industry, and I expect that to translate to the lowest churn by the time we're done.\nBrett Feldman: If you want to mind, if I guess as a churn follow-up question. Where are you in understanding the churn profile of your fixed wireless base, either just as a stand-alone broadband customer or perhaps the impact it has on your mobile churn to the extent of bundle with mobile.\nMike Sievert: We're really happy with it. What we do with any business is we age it into cohorts and look at it sort of based on people that have been with us 1.5 years, people that have just been with us a few weeks. And what you see is what you -- exactly what you would expect, which is the more aged cohorts are settling into a beautiful pattern. We have the youngest broadband base in the industry because we went from nothing to 2.5 million subscribers all in the last few months. And so, we have to really break it down to understand it. And when we do, we're very pleased. And one of the things that happens as a dynamic on this business is that the barriers to trial, therefore, the cost to us of encouraging that trial are totally different than wireline. We're not sending some drug -- some truck to your house to dig ditches or drill holes in the side of your house and all kinds of cost. We're letting you take home a modem and router and give it a shot. And if you love it, you wind up sticking with it. And if not, there's sort of a no harm, no file relationship. This is, let's try it again in a year that wasn't perfect for you right now because we're pouring capacity into this network. And as long as we treat customers really well and they gave this a shot, and we were transparent with them that as to whether or not it would work. The vast majority will keep it, but the small portion of people that don't, doesn't really wind up costing us anything. So, the dynamics of early churn in a business like this are totally different than traditional broadband is one of the things that makes it a better business model.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Barden: So, I guess the first question would be for Peter. If you could kind of kind of step us through the guidance and the changes from the Analyst Day outlook from $28 billion to $29 billion, what's changed to move your midpoint expectations up? And then from the free cash flow or original guidance of $13 billion to $14 billion, what's moved your midpoint down? And what are moving parts in between those two things? And the second question would be, Mike, what would be your appetite to proactively reach out to SoftBank within the confines of the stock buyback program and clean up this $48.8 million share issue that seems to be keeping for whatever reason, and I understand the lockup and it seems to be keeping T-Mobile stock from going north of $150 million. Is there an appetite to just get rid of that and just make sure that, that's not a headwind for the stock on a go-forward basis?\nMike Sievert: Those are both great questions, Dave. Let's start with EBITDA and cash flow. As you could just eliminate all the headwinds and tailwinds since the early 2021 kind of give us a high level.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes.\nMike Sievert: But we're the only still talking about our 2021 guidance. And we're talking about pulling into the stations and beating it. And that should say a lot about our business plan and the integrity of it. But it is actually quite different than what we were expecting in terms of some of the shaping of it inside. Peter, maybe you can give some color.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely, when I just think, Dave, back to Analyst Day and what's happened since then, you've certainly seen a tremendous amount of incremental profitable growth than what we see. And you saw the ARPA trajectory grow you've seen high-speed Internet and the tremendous growth that we've had there and the ability to accelerate synergies. On the flip side, of course, the world has changed a lot since then, and inflation is one of the elements, that's impacted a lot of companies. For us, we've been a lot more insulated than others, and we've talked before around why that is with our ability early on after the merger to walk down major categories of costs during a time when the negotiation looks a lot different in low interest rate environments and low inflation rate environment. So, there's a lot of the kind of puts and takes and why you see us now being able and confident to express a guy that's actually above Analyst Day. When I think about just the shaping of the core EBITDA throughout the course of the year, what you're going to have, of course, is continued profitable growth and continued synergy unlock. And one of the things that's assumed in the core EBITDA guide is the wireline sale close somewhere around midyear and that's a little bit of a drag on core EBITDA. So as I think about like Q1 probably in the approximately 6.9 range and then continued unlock throughout the course of the year on core EBITDA. And then how I think about from there to free cash flow, really free cash flow in 2023 as a few onetime items that you need to consider. And first and foremost is we're actually now in '23 achieving what we've been talking about for a long time now, which is the highest conversion of service revenue to free cash flow in the industry, despite these kind of few onetime things that I'll highlight. One is merger-related expenses, and I spoke in the prepared remarks around $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And that's a little bit higher than we assumed at Analyst Day in terms of total merger-related expenses by about $400 million, and that gives you now an incremental unlock up to $8 billion of total run rate synergies. So, that's one -- the other is a 21 cyber event. And remember, you saw us take a lot of the expense-related charges in 2022, but we anticipate the cash flow associated with the class action settlement to outflow in '23. And then the last again is related to wireline, where as you recall, we have an IT related take-or-pay agreement. The first year after close is $350 million and then tapers down significantly from there. And so, we're assuming about half of that flowing into '23. So that's how you kind of take core EBITDA down to free cash flow guide. And hopefully, that answered almost all the puts and takes.\nMike Sievert: I just love the question, by the way, Dave, because our guide on cash flow for next year is to have 75% year-on-year growth. And you're like, right. We have just a little low respect. And the answer is I hope so. Let's see what happens. So when you had a second question about SoftBank. Obviously, we know the SoftBank guys very well. We talked a lot, we're in constant communication. But I wouldn't say there's a deal imminent. And there's a reason for that, which is people on both sides of a potential transaction, believe that we're moving past 150 anyway. And so, they don't have a lot of incentive to give us a deal or a discount because they think they're getting this event we've always planned for it. We've always believed the average analyst target is 170 on this business. If you look at our rapidly expanding cash flow profile and the durability of our growth strategy, we think this event is probably coming. So, it doesn't feel like it feels like for us, we would want to discount it, we were going to take that out and they look at it and say, \"Yes, but why would I give you a discount and so there's -- that's a little bit of color on it. So I wouldn't say a transaction is imminent, but I wouldn't say it's impossible either. I think the operator cut you off. But yes, we know and thank you for that -- great. And so looking over, if we look at the Twitter, Bill Ho always has some great questions. T-Mobile, John Fryer, Mike Katz, state of prepaid for T-Mobile competitors, including MVNOs. And T-Mobile was the only net positive on prepaid, others had losses. What's going on with prepaid and also what's going on with the MVNO market. Since it includes the MVNO market, I'll actually switch to Mike Katz you can tell us a little bit about what's happening in prepaid.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Like Mike said, we're really excited about what happened in prepaid. We were the only one with positive gains. And I think most importantly, we have and continue to have the number one brand in prepay with Metro. And we see the Metro growth being a big tailwind for us. We also have a really healthy and robust MVNO set of partnerships, including big exclusive partners that also had significant growth over the course of '22 and in Q4. And we've got a diverse set of partners that both focus in unique distribution that we don't always fully reach with the T-Mobile brand and unique segments that also sometimes are underrepresented with the T-Mobile brand. So, we feel really good about the portfolio of products and brands that are reaching the prepaid market. I find it particularly gratifying that in an environment where there's lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid going on and which has lasted longer than most people predicted it would last. Our prepaid brand continues to be the strongest in the market and the only one that grew this quarter. That's fantastic because you have seen lots of momentum across the industry from prepaid to postpaid because of the economic times. People are qualifying for postpaid and continue to do so to the premise of the earlier question about what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. And yet our prepaid brand remains this strong. The lowest churn ever in our history on prepaid and the lowest in the industry was in 2022. And so this is a business where -- that has a great bond with its customers. They stick with it for a long time. They love Metro by T-Mobile, and it's a real source of strength. Jud, is that -- does that take us to the end of the program?\nJud Henry: It does. We can probably take one more question and then we got to hop it up. So operator, one more and then we got a call it a day.\nOperator: So our next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question.\nPeter Supino: A question on postpaid phone ARPU. For many years, your ARPU model was flat to down annually and 2022 is a fantastic year for ARPU. Thanks in part to MAX. MAX sell-in still sounds really steady for '23. And so, thinking about your outlook for flattish. I'm just wondering why we might not expect to see more growth in ARPU and maybe even a similar year to 2022 in '23.\nMike Sievert: A part of it is because it's early in the year, and it's not that clear where the dynamics of competition will be. If you look back to our multiyear Analyst Day targets, we actually thought back then, back to all the puts and takes, and Peter just kind of talked about this, that there would be much more going on, on sort of the service revenue ARPU side, And we didn't anticipate as much as what wound up happening on the device side. And so we guided accordingly on service revenues and ARPU where we achieved the '23 service revenues last year and ARPU growth was a big reason for that. But we had unexpected costs on the device side because the factors of competition sort of shifted. So it's a little early to comment on ARPU. We do know that if there's an opportunity for growth versus just generally stable, it would be more in the second half than the first half, and there's reasons for that. But we really like where this is. The underlying dynamics on Magenta MAX are stronger not moderating. They are stronger than they've ever been. But on the other hand, we're finding success with military, with seniors, with business and other things that could be dilutive to ARPU, but are fantastic on a CLV basis. And that's why we have to be careful about not getting people to hooked into ARPU. ARPA, we're guiding for growth because we see lots of opportunity for customers to continue to double down on their relationships with us across the board, including new device types and including home and business broadband. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of puts and takes on kind of why it unfolded the way it unfolded.\nJud Henry: Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Again, I look forward to catching up with you again soon. If you have any other questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations and Media Relations team, and have a great day.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "Yes. Like Mike said, from 30% one year ago to 60% where we'll keep hitting it just reminded about the size of this market. This is 140 million people across the entire country. It's 50 million households. It's 40% in the U.S. in terms of how we define small markets in rural areas, which is everything outside of the top 100 markets. But this overall business, it's been so fun. My heritage is I started out 25 years ago selling into a market are bringing cell phone service into rural markets, and it's in such times to actually bring usable Internet service, whether it be in your home or the mobile service in dual markets. So it's a very, very fun issue so far. And I got to tell you, our switching is up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And when you look at where we're competing, again, 60% of the markets across all small markets areas, we're on in key areas of Verizon peaking over the leadership position in share of portends across the entire market, so a lot a lot of fun. When you look at what's happening to with high-speed Internet, that's a new for opportunity for us in smaller markets and we are in. About 1/3 of our total HSI, high-speed Internet net adds went out of smaller markets or areas, and that's a big catalyst for us in these particular geographies to be that front door in that consideration. But when you look at -- as been talking about this for a while in terms of not having to make a choice between the great value and a great network, that's never been more important, particularly in these areas that have been underserved for the last 25 years and certainly in the last 10 years from mobile perspective. So, we have a lot of fun doing it."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks Mike. So in T-Mobile for Business, as Mike mentioned earlier, we continue to build very strong momentum, which is driven by our 5G network leadership combined with toward winning customer service model. In Q4, we continued to grow our service revenue. We delivered one of our highest ever postpaid so net add performance. We recorded our lowest postpaid phone churn since the merger with Sprint, and we grew our voice ARPU. In fact, we grew strong net adds every quarter in '22 and it's having an impact, as you can see in Verizon's business trend, which was its highest ever levels in '22. And their business to net adds declined sequentially for the last three quarters. We've also achieved five consecutive quarters of business Internet growth. Some of our key wins in strategic verticals, we found in the airline industry, where we've won nine out of 10 major airlines growing our base with these customers by 15% in Q4 alone. In the healthcare industry, we welcome to Ensign here as a using company who's deploying our mobility of a service solution to their 25,000 employees. In banking, large financial institutions are fast adopting on multiline solutions. We won three new logos in Q4 for a total of 24 accounts. In the public sector, we welcome to Chicago PD, Head County, Dallas IST. And even in our Advanced Network Solutions category, we signed on Formula 1, where we're on the last Vegas, be providing powering our operations and ensuring top performance fees. And we also welcomed Bell Resorts, the largest mountain resort operator where we're working together to provide innovative guest experiences, helping meet their sustainability goals and enhance restore operations. And we know why we're laying, it's not a race to the bottom, it's not a bit of the lowest rate of pricing down. We always treat our customers first. And in the modern workplace where CIS, we are focused on productivity digital transformation, even more considered sales. And therefore, it matters that we have a two-year head start in IT network leadership. It matters that we deploy customers drove coverage, and we're differentiated as a superior network an unparalleled service model. I'm going to it over to you, Peter."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Awesome. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, our 2022 results highlighted our strong execution in accelerating the moderation while leveraging our network leadership to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. This translated into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth of 8% in 2022. We delivered core adjusted EBITDA of $26.4 billion, up 12% and reaching a record high and at the high end of our recently raised guidance. We realized approximately $6 billion of synergies in 2022 or roughly the total run rate synergies expected in our original merger plan in 2018. Our strong margin expansion also unlocked rapid free cash flow growth, which grew at an industry-best 36% year-over-year to $7.7 billion and that's even after funding our peak CapEx year in 2022. This strong financial performance allowed us to commence our share buybacks ahead of our original 2023 time line. We repurchased 16.5 million shares for $2.3 billion in Q4, bringing the cumulative total repurchase to $21.4 million shares for $3 billion in 2022. This is such an exciting start to this opportunity to deliver significant shareholder value. So let's talk about how our great execution and investments in '22 set us up for another strong year of growth in 2023. We expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated growth strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to be down versus 2022. This guidance assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from fans. That profitable growth leads to core adjusted EBITDA that is expected to be between $28.7 billion and $29.2 billion, or up 10% midpoint based on continued growth in service revenues and merger synergies and above our Analyst Day guidance for 2023. This excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to further ramp to between $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching a full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule. And thanks to great execution by the teams. We not only delivered accelerated synergies, but now also expect higher run rate synergies of approximately $8 billion in 2024, of which approximately $2 billion is avoided cost, which is consistent with the amount expected at our Analyst Day. With the major integration work now behind us, we expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes, and is expected to be front-end loaded with roughly 40% expected in Q1. This is expected to be the last year of material margin related costs from a P&L perspective. And just as we have highlighted at Analyst Day, cash payments related to merger costs have underwent the P&L recognition to date and are expected to invert and be between $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 with almost half of that total heading in Q1. Net cash provided by operating activities, including these payments for merger-related costs, expected to be in the range of $17.8 billion to $18.3 billion. We expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion as we deliver capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. I would expect this to be a bit more weighted towards the first half of the year. Our capital efficiency and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Together, this results in expected free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our large tension and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And this also represents a free cash flow service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. Turning now to taxes, we expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023 and as we continuously win and then deepen our cap relationships. Altogether, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Yes. And then on share buybacks, Craig, I think the important thing is that the strategy hasn't changed, other than, of course, the ability with the financial performance of the Company to initiate those earlier. And so, we couldn't have been more excited to get that first $14 billion through Q3 approved, and you saw we delivered $3 billion of that in 2022. We continue to have line of sight to the up to $60 billion. And so, nothing's changed with regards to the strategy. We're very excited about the cash flow generation of the business, and the flexibility that, that provides. If you think about shaping, of course, I'm not going to talk about day-to-day or week-to-week shaping for natural reasons. But of course, you've got the growth of core EBITDA coming throughout the years, which gives you financial flexibility. As you know, we're very prudent in just the leverage target that we've set overall. But again, nothing has changed with respect to the strategy, very excited about the free cash flow generation and the shareholder remuneration affords. Yes. Let me just add to that. I think what you heard Callie say is we're competing on quality, by and large, and ARPUs are rising. They rose in 2022 in the business space. And the premise of your question, they're lower than consumer, but they rose in 2022 because CIOs are picking us because we have the best network and the best solutions, and they're interested in what we can bring in 5G that our competitors are behind on. And so, that's I think, very much to the premise of your question. As we go forward, one of the things to keep in mind is that even though business ARPUs are lower than consumer and always have been, and there's no structural change happening there. They are very good. The cost to sell in that area is lower longevity. So, there's plenty of reasons to like that business that are different for ARPU. That's why you got to be careful about ARPU as a guiding metric for the profitability of the business because it's not. The second part of his question was CapEx. Thanks for the question, John. We're coming off what has been a historic year for network investment in this company. I mean we had an accelerated spend in 2022. And you can see in Mike's opening comments, the results that are coming from that. Our 5G leadership is just not disputed in the marketplace. So that's now translating to overall network leadership, which is just tremendous progress for the business, and I thought a series of great growth opportunities as Jon just outlined in rolling across many other parts of the country too. So, as we look at a sustainable level in '23, we're in a great place because we got the integration effectively complete last year. That was a massive effort, but we're ahead of schedule there. And as we look at the build program on 5G and overall network, we just took great strides. Today, we announced 265 million people now covered with our ultra capacity footprint in the U.S. And that number will be 300 million people covered with our ultra capacity footprint by the end of this year. So we continue to expand that great powerful 5G service across the country. 300 million is a number that neither of our major competitors have even considered announcing a target to reach or to achieve. And in addition to that first part of your question, John, we continue to pain spectrum assets on 5G. I mean, we're a 5G business. We're trying to commit our spectrum, our entire portfolio to 5G as fast as we can. Why, because it's delivering just a tremendous experience to our customers. So that spectrum position today. We have 150 megahertz that are dedicated to 5G, some markets. And that's, I think, currently more than AT&T and Verizon combined having the 5G space. And that number, we've said we're targeting 200 megahertz just on the mid-band spectrum by the end of this year. And so, we've recently talked about how we're not just deploying 2.5 gigahertz. We're also adding powerful PCS spectrum in the space. That's a big part of the program as we move through in 2023. You asked about DoD and C-band spectrum. We have some great assets there. Probably a 2024 deployment plan for us as the opportunity to leverage and deploy that spectrum cleaned up with the FAA, et cetera, but 200 megahertz on mid-band is going to be an industry-leading proposition long before we get to the pentanes. So delighted with the progress, I mean, the 5G network is just unbeatable today across all markets in the U.S. The recent benchmarking clearly demonstrates that. But I think more exciting for the business and especially for the network team is this overall network leadership, something that we've been working way on for, as Mike referenced decades and now is in our hands. So a lot to do, '23 will be a continued busy year for us, but the plan is to extend on that work I can speak to the question on the macro environment. From a consumer perspective, No, we're not seeing it. Of course, this is an area where we're very cautious. But when we think about just Q3 to Q4, we actually saw a little bit of improvement in voluntary churn. And bad debt was exactly what we laid out in Q2 stable on a percentage of revenue and in fact, actually lower than AT&T or Verizon on those metrics. So, it's something we're looking at and making sure we would closely monitor. As we said, this could also be a moment of opportunity for us because as a consumer set to the extent that you're pressured from a recessionary perspective, from an inflationary perspective, it might make you consider a lot of categories of spend and wireless is being one of those. And at the time you create the consideration moment, you go look around. And again this is the time where not only 5G leadership, but has translated into overall network leadership, coupled with that value proposition just being a fabulous time and it could be a tailwind for us. Again, looking at and making sure we're cautious, but nothing we're seeing right now gives us costs for concern. Yes. Absolutely, when I just think, Dave, back to Analyst Day and what's happened since then, you've certainly seen a tremendous amount of incremental profitable growth than what we see. And you saw the ARPA trajectory grow you've seen high-speed Internet and the tremendous growth that we've had there and the ability to accelerate synergies. On the flip side, of course, the world has changed a lot since then, and inflation is one of the elements, that's impacted a lot of companies. For us, we've been a lot more insulated than others, and we've talked before around why that is with our ability early on after the merger to walk down major categories of costs during a time when the negotiation looks a lot different in low interest rate environments and low inflation rate environment. So, there's a lot of the kind of puts and takes and why you see us now being able and confident to express a guy that's actually above Analyst Day. When I think about just the shaping of the core EBITDA throughout the course of the year, what you're going to have, of course, is continued profitable growth and continued synergy unlock. And one of the things that's assumed in the core EBITDA guide is the wireline sale close somewhere around midyear and that's a little bit of a drag on core EBITDA. So as I think about like Q1 probably in the approximately 6.9 range and then continued unlock throughout the course of the year on core EBITDA. And then how I think about from there to free cash flow, really free cash flow in 2023 as a few onetime items that you need to consider. And first and foremost is we're actually now in '23 achieving what we've been talking about for a long time now, which is the highest conversion of service revenue to free cash flow in the industry, despite these kind of few onetime things that I'll highlight. One is merger-related expenses, and I spoke in the prepared remarks around $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And that's a little bit higher than we assumed at Analyst Day in terms of total merger-related expenses by about $400 million, and that gives you now an incremental unlock up to $8 billion of total run rate synergies. So, that's one -- the other is a 21 cyber event. And remember, you saw us take a lot of the expense-related charges in 2022, but we anticipate the cash flow associated with the class action settlement to outflow in '23. And then the last again is related to wireline, where as you recall, we have an IT related take-or-pay agreement. The first year after close is $350 million and then tapers down significantly from there. And so, we're assuming about half of that flowing into '23. So that's how you kind of take core EBITDA down to free cash flow guide. And hopefully, that answered almost all the puts and takes."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. As you can see, we're here in New York City with the whole senior team. And I am very much looking forward to talking about 2022 and a look ahead to what I think is going to be an even more exciting future. 2022 was a record year for our company. It was our best year ever. We welcomed more customers to the un-carrier than ever before in our history, and we translated this customer growth to industry-leading financial growth, finishing with a strong Q4. Our T-Mobile team delivered at or above the high end of our guidance across the board. 2022 was also the biggest investment year in our history. By accelerating these investments, we rewrote the competitive dynamic on network competition for good, and laid the foundation for a highly capital-efficient run rate business beginning this year. When I took responsibility as CEO almost three years ago, I spoke to you about an opportunity we saw that if we could execute well, we can position T-Mobile to be the first company in our space to simultaneously offer the best network and the best value, breaking a decade forced choice on consumers and businesses. While the results are in, with the latest network awards and we've done it. T-Mobile is not only the 5G leader, but now the overall network leader. And this opens big growth pathways for our future. Along the way, we successfully completed the customer migration and network shutdown faster than planned, while also delivering industry-leading growth in both customers and cash flows through our differentiated and profitable growth strategy. And we launched our most ambitious ESG initiatives ever. Our financial outcomes allowed us to accelerate our network deployments and begin share repurchases earlier than planned. And looking ahead to 2023, we're very confident in our differentiated strategy. In fact, we're on track to meet or exceed all of the aspirations for this year that we shared with you way back at our Analyst Day in early 2021. I'm excited to talk more about all of this today, and let's start with our merger integration. Back when we closed the merger, a few people would have thought that we could shut down the Sprint network faster than planned and deliver the lowest churn in our history at the same time, that's exactly what our team did. We moved all Sprint customers off the network and completed the DCOM of Sprint sites, all within 2.5 years. And not only that, we had our best postpaid phone churn year in the Company's history at just 0.88, and we were the only one in the industry to deliver year-over-year improvement for full year 2022. Diving into network, while T-Mobile has been the clear 5G leader for years, we can now say that T-Mobile has the best overall network in the United States. That is a big statement. For the first time ever, T-Mobile won a clean suite across every single overall network category in Ookla's recent report. And recent data from Opensignal and umlaut also show T-Mobile as the clear leader with over 12 billion data points across these network coverage and performance tests, the facts show T-Mobile is the new network leader. And this brings with it an exciting new opportunity, convincing people that this 30-year force choice between network and value is gone when you choose T-Mobile. This is no small task. But other results show that more and more people are beginning to notice and they're choosing T-Mobile. In fact, our results in '22 demonstrated how differentiated and effective our growth strategy really is. Kind of feels like deja vu. When I think back to this time last year, and everyone was worried about what would happen when industry growth began to normalize. And I sense that's top of mind for everyone again as we enter 2023. Well, let's show up immediately last year. The industry did see lower year growth in the second half. And guess what? Our unique ability to offer customers both the best network and the best value across multiple new and underpenetrated segments of the market led to T-Mobile's SaaS growth year ever, with two of our best core system merger coming in the second half, even as market growth began to normalize. We posted a record 1.4 million postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry once again. We're winning the highest share of switching decisions in the industry through our clear growth strategies. And we delivered our highest-ever postpaid net adds of over $6.4 million, above the high end of our recently raised guidance. This included our highest postpaid fund net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 3.1 million. We explained it before. Our strategy is differentiated and durable because it's driven by taking share in places where we're massively underpenetrated relative to the competition and where we now have the winning hand. Including T-Mobile for Business, where we just delivered one of our highest ever phone net adds quarters in Q4. And we're clearly having an impact on the incumbents. As you can see in Verizon's highest-ever business churn in 2022. In the top 100 markets for consumer, we're winning with prime network seekers who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs and at a lower cost. We're only beginning to tap into this new opportunity. And in smaller markets in rural areas, where we're bringing a better value proposition and a better network to new geographies, we really didn't play in before. We're capturing a win share of switchers in the high 30s, which says a lot because in many of these places, we're only just getting started. In addition, we added 2 million high-speed Internet customers in our first full year since our commercial launch. In fact, T-Mobile had more broadband net adds in '22 that AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined. This is a powerful new phenomenon for our brand in addition to being a good business. And not only did we deliver industry-leading customer growth, but our focus on profitable growth translated into industry best financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 12% year-over-year and free cash flow up 36%. The investments we've made in 2022, including in our cybersecurity capabilities showed up in a critical way a few weeks ago. I want to take a moment to address the recent cyber incident. After address identifying a criminal attempt to access our data through an API, we shut it down within 24 hours. And more importantly, our systems and policies protected the most sensitive kinds of customer data from being accessed. We take this issue very seriously. Find disappointed that the crime actor will be able to obtain any customer information, we are confident that our aggressive cybersecurity plan working with the support of some of the world's experts will allow us to achieve our goal of becoming second-to-none in this area. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a more connected and sustainable future. Nearly three years ago, we launched our digital divide initiative called Project 10Million to bring connectivity to underserved students nationwide with free or highly subsidized service. And I am proud to say we're now more than halfway to achieving our goal. To date, we've provided $4.8 billion in services and connected more than 5.3 million students, and we're not slowing down. We're also working hard to create a more sustainable future, recently committing to our most ambitious sustainability goal yet to achieve net-zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040. This makes T-Mobile one of the only four Fortune 100 companies to do so. Our work in this space is being recognized, including being named in the top 20 of JUST Capital's 2023 rankings, which measures companies against metrics that matter to our communities, including environmental impact, where we ranked number one in our industry. Okay. Let me wrap up with some comments on 2023 and what's ahead. With these record results, we've clearly shown that our differentiated strategy has lots of room to run. And I strongly believe that this will prove to be the case even as industry as a whole is seeing moderating growth and potentially a challenging macroeconomic environment. In fact, it may be especially true in that case as our unique high-quality positioning is proving remarkably well suited to the times. We believe 2023 will also be a year in which we begin to see the payoff. In terms of EBITDA and massive cash flow expansion of years of work on merger integration, synergy attainment and the most ambitious network build in U.S. history, all of which are mostly behind us now. And an ongoing differentiated profitable growth, which is the durable result in front of us. I could not be more proud of this team and our employees, and I am so excited for all that's ahead in 2023 and beyond. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and our guidance for 2023. Well, I'll start, Craig. Let me start by telling you a little bit about how we view the convergence space. And obviously, to the premise of your question, we are competing very ambitiously in this space with more new broadband net additions in 2022 than the rest of the industry combined. So we're very happy with our position, and it has lots of room to run for years to come. But on the other hand, the larger question is whether or not we're doing this for offensive reasons or defensive reasons. And our view is that the market has shown that customers will accept bundles. But it's far from certain weather bundles are something that they will require. And so we're some flank is exposed that we have to protect. We're interested in convergence because we have a lot to offer. And we have a great brand, a great capability, a great team, great distribution and the ability to add value to the space as you're seeing in our present success in home broadband through 5G. So we're very interested in the space. But I'll tell you, we haven't decided whether or not that would translate into augmenting that strategy with a wireline approach. But if we did, it would be because it's a good business. Not because we feel like there's some flank that we have exposed that we need to protect. And so while we haven't made a decision about it, I can tell you a few things that we've decided not to do. And I think that's important for people to understand. I personally have no interest in having some kind of major change to our strategy as a company or the financial outcomes that will go from that strategy or the shareholder remuneration that flows from our financial outcomes. We're on a mission to become the best in the world at wireless. And we're pursuing that mission ambitiously and so far, very successfully. That is the place where the future lies and where we want to be. And I'm interested in delivering all of the financial outcomes that we promised you that flow from that business plan. And the shareholder remuneration and share buybacks that flow from that, and we're not interested in something that would cause a material change in any of that. Secondly, because of that, I think we've looked at it and said, if we got involved we would do it most likely with partners. It would make -- it would just be smart to do it with partners versus by ourselves. And that means purely through a partnership or if we have an ownership stake of some type of some kind, it would be off balance sheet and again, would not be at a level that would have a material change in terms of who we are. And then as I said, we'd be interested in it. If it's something that we could add value and make the market better for customers and make some money doing it, directly for the merits of the business, not necessarily for the merits of how it would attribute to wireless. And that's because consumers are sort of voting with their feet. And so far, we haven't seen a benefit to convergence that really translates into consumer value beyond just a discount. And there are plenty of ways to deliver customers' discounts when you have the superior assets in wireless superior balance sheet and wireless, the best overall network and a tradition of a brand that delivers outstanding value. So hopefully, that helps clear that one up. We'll start with Callie on what we're seeing and then switch over to Peter on ARPA and ARPU. Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And your question, we're definitely not anticipating ARPU to be down on a year-over-year basis. And probably our guide right now would be generally stable. And that's primarily the mix-driven metric as we just had the continued success in T-Mobile for Business, for example, being a mix-driven metric responders or segmentation approach. But there's been just a this amount of tailwind. We continue to see strength in Magenta MAX take rates in Q4. So as you get further into the year, there's potentially opportunity that we could even see some increases over that. But I'd say right now, generally stable with potential upside later in the year, and we'll see how that develops. Thanks, John. Those are two great ones. First, on smart markets in the rural areas, and I'll hand it to Jon. I am so pleased with what's happening here. We set out to do something we hadn't really done at scale before a couple of years ago. And 2022 was a pivotal year due to all of that at scale. We moved from 30% in to 60% of the marketplaces where we're really competing at -- I think we've explained to you before, what we call internally license to play or better. And in those places, the numbers have been placed. So, maybe, Jon, if you can give a little bit of color on how that's going and maybe even some numbers and back it up, and then we'll switch and talk about what's going on in the network. And to see shares switching well into the 30s given that a lot of these places, we really does start, I mean, we have the last many years of experience. And that shows that those customers have a resonance with our brands and with our story and they want in. So, we're very pleased without these markets and consumers in the markets are responding. Terrific, let's go back -- sorry. Yes, the CapEx fees where the answer is yes, $9 billion to $10 billion run rate. So that's also we're getting done with that line '23 and beyond. One of the things you can take away, John, from what Neville just said is that this network leadership story that has emerged has lots of room to run. We said three years ago, that we had jumped out in front on 5G, and we were at least two years ahead of our competitors. And I quoted in two years from now, we'll still be two years ahead of our competitors, and that's exactly what has unfolded if you listen to Neville's statistics, he told you that we're already, as you know, at 265 million people covered by ultra capacity. Neither of our competitors has stated the goal to be there any time in the next two years. In fact, they've stated to go for the end of next year, two years from now, it's less than that. And yet, we're not stopping there. We're on our way to 300 million people this year. But to me, is actually the more exciting part about the future testing you heard from Neville is going from 130 megahertz deployed of mid-band, 150 overall, 130 in mid-band to 200. That's a massive capacity expansion that's happening. Because that's not just factors on the experience you get every day. So far, our medium speeds are 5x faster than just three years ago. Our Magenta MAX customers and you know how Magenta MAX is. They're using 30 gigs a month. These are big advantages versus our competition. In broadband, where we're generating more net adds than the rest of the industry combined, has lots of room to run. And so that's all on the heels of this massive capacity that's not just in the network, that's still coming and within the run rate of the $9 billion to $10 billion in capital per year. Great. Well, first on broadband, it's kind of stating the obvious. When somebody who is a fiber provider. So as you know that product not as good as our product. It's kind of like the people at pointing a finger at the world's best-selling car, Toyota saying, we're faster. We have the faster car. Yes, but Toyota is the world's best-selling car. And that's because -- and if you look in the case of T-Mobile, 5G home broadband because it's perfectly suited to what people want. And although it has less overall potential for capacity than a strain of fiber, which is patently obvious, it's radically simple at low cost. It's transparent. It's portable within tens of millions of households. It has the speed and capacity that allows people to think that they want. And therefore, the net promoter scores are some of the highest in the industry, 10 points higher than fiber, 30 points higher than cable. And most of our customers are coming directly from cable, not just from rural areas or unconnected places or DSO. And so it kind of demonstrates that we've got a product here with the right mix of services to meet people's needs, lots of room to run. When we launched this product, we talked about 7 million to 8 million homes. And as you can see from our numbers, we're tracking beautifully to that. And the question now is where do we go from here? And I gave comments before about whether or not we're looking at ways that could augment that strategy, of course, we are. But that's because we have a winning product and massively expanding capacity to support it. One of the things to keep in mind is that economically, this unlike fiber and cable. This product so far is not burdened by amortization of capital and the cost structure, right? So we're able to take the capital that we deployed through mobile and find places with excess capacity and market broadband there. And those places are rapidly expanding even though we have millions of customers on board now soaking some of it up. We're moving our eligible homes from 40 million to 50 million. And that means that there's 50 million homes out of 140 million nationwide, where tomorrow morning, you applied for service, we'd say, yes. And so that is a big footprint. And we think the product is beautifully suited to the times. We're making sure our companies ready for after you know. I mean, but the fact that we saw bad debt moderate from Q2 with inflation for spike surprise consumers last spring. How Q3 and Q4 were lower than Q2. In voluntary involuntary churn was actually lower in Q4 than Q3. Our bad debt rates are lower than AT&T's are for us and showing the quality of our customer base, which has always been a question people had, especially after the Sprint merger. And so, we're signing in the future like everybody else, but we take it as far from a foregone conclusion that very stressful economic times are coming. We're prepared if they are. We're financially prepared. And as importantly, we prepared to serve American consumers that in that situation may be questioning whether they ought to be having a great network at a better value. And we're ready to stand up and serve them if they start questioning whether or not they should be saving money in this category because we are uniquely positioned with our high-quality value positioning for economic times like what might be coming. And so, we're ready in other case, but the emphatic answer to the question is no, we are not seeing it. Yes. So Jud, should we go in between here, should we go up to -- you guys can't see this, but we always have screens pointing at us with Twitter -- Twitter questions, and we'd like to open it up. And I was going to have you call out a couple, but there's one that's from at Magenta. So, they win, they have to have a long -- but it's actually a really good question. It kind of goes to something we've been talking about, which is what's T-Mobile doing to maintain its industry-leading growth, giving cable starting to build momentum in the telco space. And we talked about convergence earlier on. And it's interesting to me that we keep getting this question. We saw cables results coming. I talked about them in Q4. And I would just tell you that it looks to us like cable, who's been in the run rate now for a long time because you had a recent uptick. It looks to us like you're seeing lots of transference in terms of net adds that add to the category, additional adds being printed, et cetera, for customers. New phone numbers being created, people coming over from prepaid as a dynamic. But what's interesting is you see that recent surge in growth from cable, and this is interesting. At a time when every one of the three wireless incumbents experienced better-than-expected churn. So churn was better than expected, for us, it was falling. AT&T was falling in Q4 as well versus a year ago. And at the moment, when cable has for some, well, it didn't surprise us, but for some, a surprise uptick in net adds. And that should kind of tell you a little bit about what's going on. So for me, we look at it as sort of, as you would expect, since this is a contact sport as sort of us against everybody else, right? And so, if I look at the second half of the year, what's interesting is T-Mobile was able to deliver 17% more postpaid net additions in the second half of this year versus last year, while the rest of the industry, Verizon, AT&T, Charter and Comcast combined in wireless, delivered 19% less postpaid phone net additions in the second half of this year versus '21. So in terms of our separation from the market at a time when people ask were doing better and better. Jud, any -- one more on Twitter before we go back? Operator, next question please? I mean, one of the things you heard from Callie before is that Q4 was one of the best net add quarters ever in our history. So, we're really comfortable with where this is -- how this is shaping up. And one of the reasons for that is there are long sales cycles in this market. And we've been at this 5G story longer than anybody else. CIOs are very interested in more strategic engagements than they were interested in a couple of years ago. And now, we're in those conversations, but we're way down the pike in them. So, we're very comfortable with where we are. We're competing extraordinarily well. And to your market share question, we're very much on track for the Analyst Day aspirations that we shared with you. You mean should I disclose that right now as a new fact. I don't think we did we haven't. I think what we've said is, it continues to be the majority from consumer, but you're seeing continued uptick in the business side as just Callie mentioned in growth there. So we see a lot of room to run on the business side as well. And obviously, continued room in the consumer space. I did see some notes on that that kind of got it wrong is that maybe business is what's surging in that area. It's the business is doing well, but it's the overwhelming majority for us is the consumer in that space. Yes. Operator, next question please. Yes. First of all, yes, on integration, there's more room to run. But principally, I think most of the room to run comes from value network, service brand. And look, we've been through this journey. We drove the Magenta brand to the best churning brand in this industry. And I certainly won't be satisfied until T-Mobile blended postpaid is the best churning brand in this industry. And that shows you we've got some room to run because while we're the most improved, which is a great price, we're not the best yet. And so that's where we're going. That's the goal. And it is, of course, there's some room to run on integration. But we're not separating it for you anymore because it's very hard to chop up at this point. All the customers are on the destination network. Some of them are on the destination biller. It's not that determinative anymore as to which biller you have because we try to make that biller sort of very opaque to you and not transparent. You're called T-Mobile in many cases. So it's -- it's just hard to chop it up now. But yes, there's still room to run to get people settled into fantastic rate plans, both on their device as well as on their service and to feel very careful with clear transparent services. But I'd say the bigger opportunity is our worst to first game plan that we know how to execute, which is give people a great gives them un-carrier moves that allow them to voice that deal and express in vote for T-Mobile. Give them the best network bar not, give them a fantastic path to great devices. Give them a brand that's famous for caring for them and the best customer service in the industry. That's why our net promoter scores are the highest in the industry, and I expect that to translate to the lowest churn by the time we're done. We're really happy with it. What we do with any business is we age it into cohorts and look at it sort of based on people that have been with us 1.5 years, people that have just been with us a few weeks. And what you see is what you -- exactly what you would expect, which is the more aged cohorts are settling into a beautiful pattern. We have the youngest broadband base in the industry because we went from nothing to 2.5 million subscribers all in the last few months. And so, we have to really break it down to understand it. And when we do, we're very pleased. And one of the things that happens as a dynamic on this business is that the barriers to trial, therefore, the cost to us of encouraging that trial are totally different than wireline. We're not sending some drug -- some truck to your house to dig ditches or drill holes in the side of your house and all kinds of cost. We're letting you take home a modem and router and give it a shot. And if you love it, you wind up sticking with it. And if not, there's sort of a no harm, no file relationship. This is, let's try it again in a year that wasn't perfect for you right now because we're pouring capacity into this network. And as long as we treat customers really well and they gave this a shot, and we were transparent with them that as to whether or not it would work. The vast majority will keep it, but the small portion of people that don't, doesn't really wind up costing us anything. So, the dynamics of early churn in a business like this are totally different than traditional broadband is one of the things that makes it a better business model. Those are both great questions, Dave. Let's start with EBITDA and cash flow. As you could just eliminate all the headwinds and tailwinds since the early 2021 kind of give us a high level. But we're the only still talking about our 2021 guidance. And we're talking about pulling into the stations and beating it. And that should say a lot about our business plan and the integrity of it. But it is actually quite different than what we were expecting in terms of some of the shaping of it inside. Peter, maybe you can give some color. I just love the question, by the way, Dave, because our guide on cash flow for next year is to have 75% year-on-year growth. And you're like, right. We have just a little low respect. And the answer is I hope so. Let's see what happens. So when you had a second question about SoftBank. Obviously, we know the SoftBank guys very well. We talked a lot, we're in constant communication. But I wouldn't say there's a deal imminent. And there's a reason for that, which is people on both sides of a potential transaction, believe that we're moving past 150 anyway. And so, they don't have a lot of incentive to give us a deal or a discount because they think they're getting this event we've always planned for it. We've always believed the average analyst target is 170 on this business. If you look at our rapidly expanding cash flow profile and the durability of our growth strategy, we think this event is probably coming. So, it doesn't feel like it feels like for us, we would want to discount it, we were going to take that out and they look at it and say, \"Yes, but why would I give you a discount and so there's -- that's a little bit of color on it. So I wouldn't say a transaction is imminent, but I wouldn't say it's impossible either. I think the operator cut you off. But yes, we know and thank you for that -- great. And so looking over, if we look at the Twitter, Bill Ho always has some great questions. T-Mobile, John Fryer, Mike Katz, state of prepaid for T-Mobile competitors, including MVNOs. And T-Mobile was the only net positive on prepaid, others had losses. What's going on with prepaid and also what's going on with the MVNO market. Since it includes the MVNO market, I'll actually switch to Mike Katz you can tell us a little bit about what's happening in prepaid. Yes. Like Mike said, we're really excited about what happened in prepaid. We were the only one with positive gains. And I think most importantly, we have and continue to have the number one brand in prepay with Metro. And we see the Metro growth being a big tailwind for us. We also have a really healthy and robust MVNO set of partnerships, including big exclusive partners that also had significant growth over the course of '22 and in Q4. And we've got a diverse set of partners that both focus in unique distribution that we don't always fully reach with the T-Mobile brand and unique segments that also sometimes are underrepresented with the T-Mobile brand. So, we feel really good about the portfolio of products and brands that are reaching the prepaid market. I find it particularly gratifying that in an environment where there's lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid going on and which has lasted longer than most people predicted it would last. Our prepaid brand continues to be the strongest in the market and the only one that grew this quarter. That's fantastic because you have seen lots of momentum across the industry from prepaid to postpaid because of the economic times. People are qualifying for postpaid and continue to do so to the premise of the earlier question about what we're seeing in the macroeconomic environment. And yet our prepaid brand remains this strong. The lowest churn ever in our history on prepaid and the lowest in the industry was in 2022. And so this is a business where -- that has a great bond with its customers. They stick with it for a long time. They love Metro by T-Mobile, and it's a real source of strength. Jud, is that -- does that take us to the end of the program? A part of it is because it's early in the year, and it's not that clear where the dynamics of competition will be. If you look back to our multiyear Analyst Day targets, we actually thought back then, back to all the puts and takes, and Peter just kind of talked about this, that there would be much more going on, on sort of the service revenue ARPU side, And we didn't anticipate as much as what wound up happening on the device side. And so we guided accordingly on service revenues and ARPU where we achieved the '23 service revenues last year and ARPU growth was a big reason for that. But we had unexpected costs on the device side because the factors of competition sort of shifted. So it's a little early to comment on ARPU. We do know that if there's an opportunity for growth versus just generally stable, it would be more in the second half than the first half, and there's reasons for that. But we really like where this is. The underlying dynamics on Magenta MAX are stronger not moderating. They are stronger than they've ever been. But on the other hand, we're finding success with military, with seniors, with business and other things that could be dilutive to ARPU, but are fantastic on a CLV basis. And that's why we have to be careful about not getting people to hooked into ARPU. ARPA, we're guiding for growth because we see lots of opportunity for customers to continue to double down on their relationships with us across the board, including new device types and including home and business broadband. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of puts and takes on kind of why it unfolded the way it unfolded. Thanks, everybody."

[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Thanks everybody. Very welcome to our third quarter call and thanks for tuning in. It is so great to be back to talk about another quarter of outstanding results by this team. Our differentiated strategy is working. Our ongoing focus on delivering the best value while simultaneously capitalizing on our network leadership position has delivered another quarter of industry leading growth in customers, EBITDA and cash flow, and we are raising our 2022 guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. All of this while completing our biggest integration milestone, I am incredibly proud of this team. As we told you when our merger closed, our plan was to expand on our fame as the industry's best value while building and becoming known for having the best network in the country, finally giving customers the ability to have both from one provider for the first time ever. Now just 2.5 years later, we're doing exactly what we planned. Our brand strength for value leadership has never been better. And it's been further aided by our competitors' price increases. And our long-established 5G lead is translating to overall network leadership for the first time and giving customers the beginnings of really a powerful network that they're really noticing. Our results this quarter are a clear demonstration of how differentiated and sustainable our growth strategy really is. Only T-Mobile has both this unique combination of network and value leadership and multiple large scale new and underpenetrated segments to tap into. To grow our business, we are also driving innovation where it matters most for customers. Through Magenta MAX, our most popular plan and the best expression of T-Mobile's 5G network, we're providing features that are meaningful to customers in their daily lives like with the recent addition of Apple TV+ and our Un-carrier move, Coverage Beyond. Well, we're not just keeping people connected on the ground, but also in the air and when they go abroad. With the launch of Easy Switch and Network Pass, we're making it simple and risk-free to experience our network and make the switch to T-Mobile. It has long been established that T-Mobile is the 5G leader. But with the rapidly growing adoption of 5G by consumers and businesses, we're now seeing that 5G lead translate into overall network leadership. And to back it up, we're beginning to win more third-party recognition for our network leadership from multiple third parties like Ookla, umlaut and PC Magazine. This is precisely the network evolution that we planned. We knew that 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that's exactly what is now unfolding. And speaking of network, we just hit our biggest merger integration milestone. By the end of Q3, we had successfully decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites, more than a year earlier than our original merger plan. And our Ultra Capacity 5G now reaches 250 million Americans. Think about that. Today, we're already where Verizon hopes to be more than two years from now. And we're not stopping. We recognize the importance of coverage to customers, and we will continue to pursue more opportunities to ensure our network is there for them whenever and wherever they need us. This lean and data informed customer driven coverage approach will guide us as we enhance and expand our network to even higher levels and in a capital efficient way using our spectrum resources. We also recognize that there are some places where it's just not practical for any wireless operator to build a terrestrial network. But because we want T-Mobile customers to have peace of mind that we have them covered no matter where they go, in Q3, we announced our joint effort with SpaceX to do just that, combining a slice of our mid-band spectrum that's already compatible with existing customer devices with next-gen satellite technology from SpaceX. Our goal is for T-Mobile customers to be connected anywhere in the U.S. where they can see the sky. Overall, this differentiated growth strategy and emerging network leadership produced another quarter of truly differentiated results. So let's get right into them. In Q3, we posted a record 394,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry again. Winning the switching decisions in this industry and growing share through our core growth strategies I've outlined for you many times is the central growth ambition of our company. In this quarter, we did that better than ever before. In addition, our network and value proposition are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, which is contributing to an all-time high in our customer prime mix. And we delivered an industry-best 1.6 million postpaid net additions, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We had our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 854,000. Our postpaid phone churn of just 0.88% improved 8 basis points from last year. Once again, we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. And our postpaid phone churn, including Sprint, was lower than Verizon's for the second consecutive quarter. And as I said, our multiple growth opportunities are all contributing to this success. Consider smaller markets and rural areas, which include 40% of the U.S. population, at the end of last year, we only had a competitive network and distribution to effectively compete in 30% of those households. Today, thanks to our accelerated network build. We have already surpassed our year-end target to compete in 50% of these households and we now expect to reach roughly 60% by the end of this year. We also continue to grow in the top 100 markets as we win the prime network seekers who are increasingly recognizing that T-Mobile has the best network for them, an audience we never effectively competed for in the past. We achieved share leadership in many of these markets in the past without winning on network. All of that is changing. So the same advantages in network and value proposition that are driving growth in smaller markets and rural areas where we're underpenetrated and are driving it in the top 100 where we've always been strong. In fact, our net account growth in the quarter was split roughly equally between these two geographic segments. Okay. Let's talk business. We continue to win business customers from incumbents as T-Mobile for Business continues to build momentum, delivering one of our highest ever postpaid phone net addition quarters in Q3. The impact we're having can be clearly seen in Verizon's business churn, which was up again at the highest levels they've ever reported. Meanwhile, we added more business accounts and had lower business phone churn than Verizon in the quarter, delivering one of our lowest ever postpaid phone churn quarters for business. Our 5G network leadership, particularly as it relates to our lead in advanced 5G services, is increasingly enabling us to become a strategic partner for enterprises and for government agencies. Okay. Let me briefly touch on high-speed Internet where additions of 578,000 hit another record high. And once again, we expect to lead the industry in net adds. In fact, I anticipate that T-Mobile had more broadband net additions than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the second quarter in a row. In addition, our high-speed Internet attracted consumers and businesses who are new to T-Mobile at an increasing pace, establishing new relationships that we can grow with additional products and services over time. In just 1.5 years since our commercial launch, we now serve more than 2 million customers with Net Promoter Scores more than 30 points higher than cable and even higher than the average fiber provider. These results demonstrate that our differentiated growth strategy and our Un-carrier playbook to provide customers with the best value and the best network continues to win, and our differentiation is a particular source of strength in this ever-changing competitive and macroeconomic environment. And importantly, we translated our leading customer growth into industry-leading financial growth in postpaid service revenues, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. This momentum has enabled us to raise our guidance every quarter this year, including today. Finally, as you know, thanks to our strong execution and confidence in the future, our Board authorized a substantial share repurchase program and did so earlier than our initial Analyst Day plans to begin in 2023. I could not be prouder of this team and of these results. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and some more information on our guidance.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. It's such a pleasure to watch this team reliably deliver on our commitments, and we did it yet again with another strong quarter in Q3. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customer accounts resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth once again, up 7% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on driving profitability translated at strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, into year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11%. That increase in customers and profitability is driving industry-leading operating and free cash flow expansion and further unlocks the massive cash flow potential of our business. These robust operating results also enabled us to achieve two major financial milestones. First, we're extremely proud to have reached an investment-grade rating from all three major agencies, opening access to a much deeper and cost effective capital pool for the company. We also closed our first asset-backed securities issuance related to our equipment receivables, which provides yet another established and attractive capital source as we continue to be opportunistic in optimizing both our capital structure and cost. And second, as Mike mentioned, we commenced the significant share repurchase program in September, and we repurchased 4.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $669 million in Q3. Cumulatively, through October 20th, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $1.5 billion. Also in Q3, we announced the planned sale of our wireline business, which resulted in a pretax loss of $1.1 billion that had substantially no cash impact to the quarter. This includes the financial liability associated with the commercial take-or-pay, the impairment to the carrying value of the associated assets and other cost to sell. The transaction is not expected to have any material financial impact to 2023 based on the expected closing timeline. All right, let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on a reducing churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds, coming from phones for the full year. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA, we now expect full year 2022 to be between $26.2 billion and $26.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and increased merger synergies. Core adjusted EBITDA excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint, primarily as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.8 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network decommissioning activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is up $200 million at the midpoint, reflecting the ongoing robust pace of our 5G deployment and success in high speed internet where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, higher by $50 million at the midpoint. This results in free cash flow increasing by more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investments and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 17% and 19% based on favorability, primarily from non-recurring benefits we've seen year-to-date. Additionally, we continue to expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value added services, including Magenta MAX. And with greater success in attracting new to T-Mobile customers with high speed internet, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up in the mid-to-high 2% range. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.\nJud Henry: Thanks, Peter. All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask questions via phone by pressing star one and via Twitter by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using $TMUS. Let's start with a question on the phone. Operator first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks guys. Congratulations on a great set of results. I just had a quick question on fixed wireless broadband actually. It looks like net adds are leveling off pretty much as you described, they would last quarter Mike. I'm just wondering, you are still expanding your addressable market as you deploy 2.5 gigahertz spectrum. Are you starting to run out of capacity in some of the early markets that you deployed such that the sort of markets open for sale isn't growing anymore? Is that what's causing the leveling off in net adds?\nMike Sievert: Not at all. In fact, the capacity picture is actually more sector by sector than market by market, and that's sort of what makes it different than other models. Just to kind of remind everybody how this works. So we took the entire country and looked at every sector of every tower and predicted mobile usage for years to come through share taking and additional mobile usage per device. And then looked at each sector, whether or not to approve addresses in that sector. And then once we get enough addresses in that sector, which is very rarely achieved so far, we stop approving addresses in that sector And so it's not really a market-by-market basis. And it's also therefore not a model that requires us to allocate significant extra capital, meaning we can go after this market very, very cost effectively because the network is substantially complete only for mobile usage. It's just a fantastic model. When we laid that out for people in 2021, we said that we saw that particular model getting us to six to eight million postpaid homes, and that would be about the model. But that doesn't mean we might not go beyond that. We'll have to watch how it all unfolds. And we just really like this run rate, it's competitive, it's rapidly growing. I love the fact that the premise of your question is why the slowdown only as many net adds as AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined, what's going wrong with your model? It's a fantastic place for us to be. But the answer to your question specifically is no, other than in some particular neighborhoods where we have lots of neighbors all joining on at once, we're not seeing any issues with capacity. And remember, and I'll ask Neville to finish this answer, we're only getting started when it relates to applying the capacity. It's not a finite quantum. In fact, right now we have 120 megahertz is it deployed in the mid-band ultra-capacity? And we're on our way to 200. Maybe you can talk about the journey because it's not a fixed capacity story.\nNeville Ray: Yes, I\u2019ll just build on your comments, Mike. I would say, Jonathan, the reverse is happening. We are just coming off the back of a tremendous quarter, actually our busiest quarter since close of the merger with Sprint. In terms of how many sites we modernized and upgraded with mid-band 5G. And so the footprint is expanding which is tremendous. We're also adding more spectrum across the footprint, both the existing and the new footprint. And that's not just in 2.5 gigahertz now, we're also adding PCS in the 1900 megahertz band to those sites. So we have more sites and more spectrum coming online as we move through the future months and years for the company. And it's not just that, right. The other great piece is that 5G is becoming more efficient. We are rapidly moving to all SA, all standalone. And what does that mean? It means we can leverage and transport all of that home internet traffic on a pure 5G lane. So that's more efficient, it's more spectrally efficient. And from a performance perspective, of course, we get better latency. So we are still in the early innings of rolling out this mid-band network. Obviously we have a tremendous leadership position, but in terms of our ability to support the numbers we've talked about by 2025, we're in a good place. And as Mike said, we will continue to work to see if we can beat those opportunities.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thank you guys.\nMike Sievert: One thing I love about this \u2013 just to wrap it is that I mentioned this in my remarks, but the net promoter scores that we're seeing on this product are just fantastic. And people love this product because it's lower price and because it does exactly what it promises. And for us it's really, really important that we keep all of that in balance on our journey to millions and millions of home served. So great. Thanks, Jonathan.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, Mike.\nMike Sievert: All right, next question.\nOperator: And moving on to Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson SVB Securities.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you. Hi there, two questions. First, as 5G chipsets become increasingly commonplace and sort of more the norm than the exception, how do you think about telling the story of 5G network advantage in a way that, particularly the consumer market sort of internalizes it? What kind of metrics should we be looking at for a sense that your network advantage is really something that is becoming known and resonating with customers? And then second on just a purely more financial note, for example, as you've bought in some previously leased spectrum and that sort of thing, how should we be thinking about the margin trajectory for the business going forward? And where you think service margins can get to longer term?\nMike Sievert: Okay, great. Let's start with the second question about bringing on leased spectrum, what's the margin trajectory, where can margins get, I'll start with Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Well there hasn't been a lot of that yet Craig. I mean, we announced our transaction with Columbia Capital that again, is subject to regulatory approval and would close six months thereafter. But again, as I think about the long-term trajectory of this business, we laid out obviously our set of mid- and long-term aspirations in Analyst Day, and there are some service revenue margins that are inferred from there. But this has been a question that's come up multiple times in terms of the competitive set and where do we land relative to the competitive set. And the most important thing to look at, because it is what powers the growth of the ability to both return shareholder to capital, to invest further in the business and to continue this flywheel success is how are you able to translate that service revenue into free cash flow? And that's where we're tremendously proud and excited about the opportunity ahead of us. And you see, even with our Analyst Day projections for 2023, even before we get the full run rate cash potential of this business in the later periods, we're projected to convert service revenue into free cash flow as a leader in this industry. And so that's really what we're laser-focused on. It gets rid of the question of leased fiber versus owned fiber, takes all that noise out of it and really shows you the value creation capability of this business.\nMike Sievert: Yes, just back to the consumer question, I'd be interested if anybody else wants to jump in. Ultimately consumers and businesses want an available signal and where they have available signal, they want speed and capacity, and they want that at a great price from a company that will treat them right and love them. And that's the bottom line. Our lead in 5G puts us in a position now that 5G is becoming the norm to be the leader in overall network. And network is one of the top two reasons why people switch. They switch either because they are not satisfied with the price or the terms around those prices, or they switch because they want a different or more powerful network signal. And more and more they are learning that T-Mobile is the company that offers that. Remember all the companies now provide signal just about everywhere people go. The question is when you are moving around, what kind of signal do you have? When you walk into buildings are you begging for a Wi-Fi password or do you have T-Mobile where your signal is probably faster than the Wi-Fi in the building you just walked into? And that kind of thing is habit forming. We're seeing usage move really fast. The most popular plan we have, and as I said, the best expression of our 5G network is Magenta MAX. It's now our most popular plan, and people are using it significantly more than they were using prior plans, and certainly more than they were using LTE, like several times more. And so, those are the kinds of things that, I think, people look to. It's applications like gaming, it's media consumption, it's the emergence of new use cases like AR and VR that are the underpinnings of the metaverse. No matter what you believe about how the metaverse might or might not unfold, clearly more immersive 3D experiences are on their way. And all those things require ultra-high capacity, low latency, powerful network signals. And that's what T-Mobile uniquely provides with our 5G advantage. The last thing I'll say, and I know your question was about consumers, is that businesses don't just go on the reputation. They actually go have a look at it. They take a 100 or so phones from each of the providers and test it for some weeks. And our win share is like it's never been. And so it really shows you that when they take a hard look at where all their customers go, where their employees go, and they look at it side by side, they come back. And more times than not and certainly more times than the past, it's T-Mobile. So we're really at the beginnings of, I think, this 5G revolution taking hold. Anybody want to add to that?\nPeter Osvaldik: I might just say one or two things to emphasize a couple that you said. 5G is more and more becoming the network. And so one of the ways that we're measuring our success in 5G is how are we succeeding in overall network perception, how are people perceiving that T-Mobile competes overall in the marketplace against our two main competitors. And I think increasingly, you're seeing us close the perception gap. You're also seeing us win awards for overall network leadership that we had never won before, and Neville can double-click into some of those. I think the way that we'll continue to talk about this is coverage in places where customers really care about and with our Coverage Beyond move, we've featured coverage both on the ground, the best 5G network, and increasingly, the best network when you're on the ground, covered when you're in the air and covered internationally. And I think you'll start to see more and more of these use cases emerge about experiences that both businesses and consumers can appreciate as we progress over the next couple of years that we'll feature and talk a little bit more about the kinds of experiences that could be unlocked by a leading network. Final words to quantify that for you. Now that 5G usage is most of the usage and 5G devices are most of the devices, we're seeing our 5G lead take root, not just in reputation and reality, but in quantitative measures. So for example, the Ookla data that came back said our average customer is experiencing speeds twice as fast as just a year ago, average customer, regardless of device type, and twice as fast as they can get from AT&T or Verizon. And that's very powerful because they noticed that, and they tell other people about it. Did you have a follow-up question? I was just starting to hear you jump in.\nCraig Moffett: No. Just \u2013 is it an issue of coverage that you can see on a map? Or is your 2.5 gigahertz spectrum more an issue about fewer dead spots because the propagation is going to be better than, say, the C-band?\nMike Sievert: Well, I mean, if you total the people that we reach right now, it's 250 million with Ultra Capacity. And with C-band and other forms of Ultra Wideband as Verizon calls it, that's where they hope to be by their public disclosures over two years from now. And so years ago, I said we were two years ahead in this 5G race. And in two years, we'd still be two years ahead. That continues to appear to be the case, even though our competitors are now in rapid deployment of their C-band assets. And of course, they are different assets. Ours is underpinned on one 5G network with a 5G stand-alone core by a massive low-band 5G network that reaches 97% of Americans. And that's a huge difference maker as well, and we see it in all kinds of scenarios, including even the resiliency of our network. When issues happen with a storm or something, we can beam in from miles away and save the day with a very high capacity 5G signal on low-band. And those things are very important to our customers, they notice.\nCraig Moffett: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And moving on to John Hodulik with UBS.\nMike Sievert: Hi, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Great, thanks. Hi, Mike. Two questions. First, churn and the ARPU. First one on the postpaid churn, 0.88%, obviously, very solid improvement. I mean, in the past, you've talked about the difference between Sprint churn and Magenta turn, and now with everybody sort of on the same network, and I think on the same plan \u2013 or on the T-Mobile plans, is there room for continued improvement just given all the improvements you guys just outlined in terms of the network? And then the other one is on the postpaid phone ARPU. I guess where are you in terms of sort of Magenta Max penetration? And given what I think is still relatively low, do you think that low single-digit ARPU growth can continue as we look into 2023? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. I'm going to go turn to, just so you have a heads up, to Peter and to Jon on ARPU and Magenta Max. On churn, I'll just personalize it. I'm not going to be satisfied until we're the lowest. Magenta was the lowest. Right now, we're number two on churn. I want to be number one. And we have the best network and the best value and a team that loves its customers. We should make our way to number one. I can't really outlook for you the journey because it's a competitive marketplace. Our competitors aren't standing still. I respect them. But I think with our team and our assets and our unique proposition, we should be number one. We're not going to probably be unpacking it for you a lot more than that. We used to do that here's the T-Mobile and give you some color on the churn and how many people and Sprint starting to look just like Magenta now, et cetera, because the premise of your question was accurate. We've shut down the Sprint network. We hope the billing migration that happens in 2023 will be largely invisible to customers. And so yes, we have a lot of work to do. We need to get them under commitment. We need to get them on the right plans, give them the full uncarrier benefit. There's some improvement we can undertake still, but it's one customer base. And we're going to be focused on how do we improve churn for that one customer base, and I won't be satisfied until we're number one. Okay. So turning to ARPU and ARPU development and Magenta Max and what we're hearing from customers, Peter and Jon.\nPeter Osvaldik: Perfect. So I'll let Jon talk about Magenta Max. But really, I mean, the trajectory of ARPU has just been just such a success this year. And when you think about the history of T-Mobile and even the plans that we had anticipated during Analyst Day when we came out, the ability to have Magenta Max be such a tailwind and allow us to get to the point where we're increasing ARPU guidance year-over-year and expecting a 2% increase is just phenomenal. But at the same time, as you know, ARPU is very much a mix-driven metric. And one of the reasons why we're so focused on ARPU itself, and just some of the examples are, of course, as you deepen relationships, for example, with our Sprint customers, as we saw migration happen, we had an opportunity to expand relationships. And so while that second, third, fourth line is obviously a lower ARPU and can impact blended ARPU, it's tremendously accretive from a CLV perspective. So that's one. In business where you're seeing some of the success in business, large enterprise, obviously, has a lower blended ARPU basis than what you typically see, but it's a tremendously CLV accretive business to bring in. Our segmentation approach, 55-plus that's bringing in such a significant amount of prime customers and driving switching is another one where you see ARPU may be mixture differently than what we see on a blended average, but high CLVs. And so that's part of the reason why you've always heard us focus on ARPA and the strategy to land and continue to expand the relationships, both with more phones, but also beyond the phone, such as with fixed wireless. And that's where we're seeing mid to high 2% year-over-year increase in ARPA. So that gives me a lot of comfort there. And I do think with ARPU, you're going to see a mixture of things happen. But Magenta Max has just been such a great tailwind. And I'd love to give Jon the opportunity to brag about it a little.\nJon Freier: Yes. We couldn't be more pleased with what's happened with Magenta Max. I mean when you think about all of our new accounts that are joining T-Mobile, we're having north of 60% of our new bands choosing Magenta Max. And like what Mike said just a few moments ago, it's our most popular plan for not only new customers that are joining, but also existing customers who are changing the rate plans. We're still under 20% of our total base on Magenta Max. So with what Peter was saying just a few moments ago, we still have tailwinds and opportunities still within our base, not only for the business benefits that, that represents, but also for the incredible consumer benefits that it represents as well. You got to remember, too, that when you look at Magenta Max, for customers with two lines or more, it's $225 per month in savings and value that consumers get. And when you think about this inflation, pressured budget cycle that so many households are in and you think about what we're doing with Apple TV+ now included on Magenta Max, Netflix included, all of the Wi-Fi included on airplanes, think about taxes and fees, that's something that we talked about and rolled out some number of years ago, I think at the beginning of 2017. That's 15% to 18% of the bill with our competitors that's completely included within our value proposition on the Magenta Max. So our customers are loving it. Like Mike said, there's incredible utility, 5x more gaming, 2.5x more social media, 2x more video, including all those emerging technologies that Mike was referring to just a few moments ago, an augmented reality and virtual reality as well. So our customers are loving it. We have a lot more opportunity still to go within Magenta Max, but we're feeling great and just could not be more pleased with the overall performance of that particular rate card.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Before we go back to the phone, I want to go out to Twitter where we're seeing questions come in. We have a question from Roger Entner and a similar one from @LinkedIn, right. So I'll go with Roger's version. So it's a question for Callie Field and TFB. In what business sector do you see the most success? Where are you gaining traction? Is it SMB, midsize or large enterprises? And maybe I'll also add to the question, Callie, because all of the competitors said in their calls, business is going fine. Business is going fine. So what's going on? We just said business is going fine. How can it be going fine for everybody? So maybe if you can answer both.\nCallie Field: Yes. Thanks, Mike. I can't \u2013 and Roger, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. I can't speak too much to AT&T and Verizon, but I do see the TAM expanding. Mike, we see in business this year, mobile subs are expected to grow by 4.6%. A third of all business subs will have a 5G connection by the end of 2022. IoT connections are expected to grow by 16%. And of course, private networks and managed services are supposed to be well over 44% CAGR year-over-year. We see work-from-home as a category expander, and we see companies that are providing employee lines to have less than 10% attrition. So this is a benefit that they're coming and talking to us about. And then when we see regulation and some of the environment from the SEC, maintaining and providing secure electronic communications allows us to expand our product portfolio and the way that we're delivering solutions. So there's a lot of really great and interesting opportunity for us. We're having a lot of conversations. And then, Roger, to your question, our revenue in enterprise is up 20% year-over-year. In SMB, we're seeing double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter. In our offering for business Internet, which is really the only 5G nationwide fixed wireless solution, we've seen double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for four quarters in a row. So in this last particular quarter in automotive and in airlines, those verticals we saw a lot of growth. We signed the deal with VinFast, which is a global EV manufacturer. Ford, we announced a partnership for our Advanced Network Solutions. We won with Boeing, Delta, a partnership with our SMRA growth in consumer, let us win in rural America with Tractor Supply, which is America's largest rural retailer where we started with fixed wireless and have the opportunity to land and expand. So in the public sector as well, Roger, we're seeing great deals with Dallas ISD, Chicago PD, the IRS. So it really is a pretty exciting time for business. Overall, across several different product categories outside of only voice and then we're in SMB, we're continuing to see growth there.\nMike Sievert: So two things are happening, right. So one, we're taking their share. That's just very clearly happening, and that's exactly what we told you would happen because of the superior network and the better value. But secondly, the pressure is a little bit being taken off of our competitors, which I think is a good thing, by the category expansion that Callie just talked about. And we forecasted this for you a while back. We told you that we thought, because of this really tight labor pool, that employees \u2013 employers would be looking at all kinds of way to retain employees, and great phone plans are certainly one of those. And this hybrid workplace that companies find themselves in has persisted longer than a lot of people predicted. And now with employees distributed outside the office, employee sponsored phone plans become a more important piece. And so you see growth in the sector, which I think takes a little pressure off of the underlying dynamic, which is we\u2019re taking their share. Okay. So let\u2019s go back to the phone for the next one.\nOperator: Thank you. Next we\u2019ll hear from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks very much. Just continuing on the TAM expansion there. We\u2019ve had another quarter, it looks like the industry will do over 2 million postpaid phone ads. Can you just talk to the sustainability of that and any broader comments on customer behavior, bad debts, day sales outstanding, et cetera? We hear a lot of other companies talking about a weaker consumer that may help you in terms of value seeking behavior. But any updated thoughts there would be great.\nMike Sievert: Great. I\u2019ll have Peter start it off and then I have a couple comments.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. So let me start with bad debt and consumer behavior. As you know, year-over-year, certainly you saw bad debt increase from the more muted pandemic-related conditions. And we\u2019re seeing involve churn roughly normalized to pre-pandemic levels. 2019 levels, which was actually our best year pre-pandemic and it\u2019s exactly what we foreshadowed for you in Q2. We did see bad debt sequentially step down and we do believe Q2 was the high water mark in terms of percentage of total revenue from a bad debt perspective. So we\u2019re seeing exactly what we anticipated seeing there. Remember, this is a core strength of ours and we\u2019ll continue to work with consumers. To your point, is it an opportunity set? Yes, I think that\u2019s another thing we\u2019ve talked about before. And we see a continued, as Jon mentioned, really, really strong uptake on our highest featured rate plan. And we\u2019re also seeing, as you see, tremendous uptake on high speed internet, both within our current base, but also with new to T-Mobile relationships that then allow us to expand beyond that. So that\u2019s a lot of, I think what we\u2019re seeing very, very optimistic about those trends. And I hope I had all the questions for you. Is there anything, Simon?\nSimon Flannery: The sustainability of the overall postpaid growth?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Well, this is another one where we\u2019ve been saying for the longest time, we do believe ultimately the industry growth were normalized. And that was always in our plans. It\u2019s always continues to be in our plans. But remember the differentiator for us is that not only do we have this tremendous combination of the value proposition and our fame for value and the 5G network leadership that is turning into overall network leadership. But it\u2019s also combined, those two things combined with the tremendous growth opportunities that are again, differentiated for us that Mike spoke about earlier. Network seekers in the top 100 are expansion in smaller markets and rural areas, TFB and the success that we\u2019re continuing to see there. So for us, we believe we\u2019re going to continue to take share because of that combination of value and network and the differentiated growth opportunities, despite the fact that we do anticipate the industry will normalize. And the proof as we continue to deliver is in the results, right? Our highest ever postpaid account net ads, a true measure of switching and relationships and the ability to land those and grow those now, you know, in the mid to high 2% range for ARPA. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it. I don\u2019t know Mike, if there\u2019s anything to add thoughts?\nMike Sievert: Well, just that normalization is starting to happen. You see these last couple quarters, overall postpaid growth was more moderate, and yet our performance is fantastic. And so it does underscore what Peter said, which is our strategy isn\u2019t actually predicated deeply on category expansion. It\u2019s predicated on share taking something we consistently and reliably do quarter after quarter. Now there\u2019s \u2013 as I mentioned, there\u2019s some pressure being taken off. Prepaid continues to contribute to postpaid but at more modest levels, business expansion is happening. And that\u2019s a newer phenomenon. And by the way, that looks to us to be partly incremental. So some people are actually carrying two phones around and so that\u2019s good for the category. And we\u2019ll have to see what happens. But what\u2019s different, of course about our strategy, as Peter said, is that unlike our competitors, we have big growing under penetrated segments where we are positioned to win with the team, the assets and the value proposition that resonates. And we\u2019re proving that that\u2019s true quarter in and quarter out. I think that\u2019s one of the things that makes our story a little different.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Back to the phone. Are you going to force us to Twitter or are you going to bring us in?\nJud Henry: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Yes, please. If we can move to Twitter.\nMike Sievert: Okay. All right, funny. All right. So we do have a couple questions that are pending. So looking Neville at the network that we\u2019ve just finished the substantial shutdown of the Sprint network, we now are one integrated network. But we did keep a lot of the Sprint sites. What percentage of them have been converted and upgraded? And also could you give an update on where we are with VoNR, that\u2019s voice over new radio. What that means is voice over 5G kind of like voiceover LTE worked in the LTE days?\nNeville Ray: Yes, I\u2019ll hit these quick, Mike. So we\u2019ve talked about how we\u2019ve effectively completed our network integration. And a big part of that was not just decom, it was incorporating literally thousands upon thousands of Sprint sites into the T-Mobile network. And that\u2019s the definition of this term that\u2019s used at keep sites. And that work is in the majority now complete too. So this last quarter, a lot of decom, a lot of these keep sites were upgraded and brought on air. And so we\u2019ve made \u2013 it was just a cracking quarter for us with all the 5G build too. So really, really pleased to have the vast majority of all of that work behind us. And now we can move on with continued expansion of coverage and performance in 5G.\nMike Sievert: So it was the single biggest capital deployment quarter of the single biggest year in our business plan for capital. So you should look more tired than you are.\nNeville Ray: Thankfully, I have a great team. Thank you, guys. But yes, I think last quarter, Mike was the busiest network quarter in the company\u2019s history. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen the level of delivery and performance on decom, on new sites, on modernization. It was a remarkable set of performance characteristics.\nMike Sievert: So that means you\u2019re touching the network with upgrades and decommissionings at the highest rate in our history, while being the only player with year-over-year churn improvements, 8 basis points and beating Verizon for the second quarter in a row. When you touch a network there\u2019s people \u2013 some people get affected very temporarily. That\u2019s powerful. And it really shows the planfulness of the build that we were able to do that\u2019s substantial of a set of improvements and yet simultaneously deliver churn improvements showing that customers are noticing and they\u2019re not just noticing pardon our dust, they\u2019re noticing improvements.\nNeville Ray: And there was an intense focus from the team on obviously churn management, but more importantly the customer experience throughout that process. And as we moved into 2022, we were way, way better at executing on the plan. We put together some time back. Quickly on voice over NR. So we always seem to forget to bring voice along with the next generation of technology. We\u2019ve done it multiple times now. But I see us as in a leader leadership position globally. We have a voice over NR, so 5G voice live in several markets. We continue to test, we continue to optimize. Why is that important? It\u2019s important because we want to have all of our traffic, all of that customer experience on a 5G lane. Today, we have to drop our customers down off of that 5G lane onto LTE. And we\u2019ve talked before about how we see our business as an all 5G network and having VoNR and that voice service is critical to executing on that strategy and making sure we have a full 5G network with full standalone capability. So we\u2019re making progress, still got work to do. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s where we want it to be yet. But I\u2019m confident over the next couple of quarters we will materially expand that footprint.\nMike Sievert: And with that stall tactic \u2013 Neville and I can just bro out on network all afternoon while you guys watch, or if the operator\u2019s back, we can take a question.\nOperator: Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good afternoon. Hi. Two questions if I could. So first, as we\u2019re getting closer to 2023 and we look back at the previously issued guidance, can you unpack some of the developments in 2022 that can impact those ranges for core EBITDA and free cash flow, whether it\u2019s inflation, the pace of synergy realization or the CapEx intentions after you\u2019re looking at the growth that you\u2019ve achieved to date. And then just secondly, as you\u2019re looking at the progress for the business model and the network, how are you thinking about fiber these days in a couple of respects? One more ownership of the fiber to run the network on. And also on the home broadband front, does the success of fixed wireless increase your interest to have a fiber pipe into a substantial number of homes and businesses?\nMike Sievert: Great. Well, let me start with the second one on fiber. We\u2019re in the same place really as we were the last time we talked about this. I think I got asked about this the last time, which is, as a management team, we have a fantastic business model and a fantastic business plan. And we are focused on it. And we love our ability to move fast and serve customers as a wireless pure-play. And it\u2019s been a big source of strength. That said we are very open minded about whether our team, our ability to execute, our brand, our in place 5G network could serve broader markets. And so we\u2019re of course interested in adjacencies that would very smartly utilize all of those assets, including our physical and digital distribution capabilities. And so we\u2019re interested. We haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions about it and I really can\u2019t answer whether 5G fixed wireless success makes us more interested or less interested. It could be a little of both for the obvious reasons. So you\u2019ll have to stay tuned. We\u2019re having a look at it. One of the things that we do is we try to learn. We have some partnerships that we\u2019re pursuing now called T-Fiber at a very small scale so we can make sure that we\u2019re learning. And then of course with \u2013 surprising to many people, but not to us consistent with plan success in 5G, we\u2019re also learning a lot about what it takes to be a home broadband operator. I\u2019m very pleased with the net promoter scores that our customers are realizing because many looked at us and said, hey you guys are pretty good at slinging smartphones and taking care of customers on mobile, but could you do that broadband thing? It\u2019s different. And we\u2019re starting to be able to answer that for ourselves and we\u2019re growing some confidence in that. So, no conclusions. We\u2019re just a team that hopefully is building trust with you that a, we like our plan, we\u2019re confident in our plan, and if we can find accretive smart ways to augment that plan in a way that makes this a better investment for you, we\u2019ll look at those things. And we haven\u2019t drawn any conclusions. As it relates to the question about 2023 guide. I mean, I\u2019m glad you asked. I might ask Peter to go ahead and lay it all out for you three months early. No, I\u2019ll just start and then ask Peter to amplify. The short answer is a lot has changed, but nothing has changed. A lot has changed. We laid out those guidelines for 2023 and beyond in the spring of 2021 and that was a very different world than we now live in. And it\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s pretty gratifying for us, because as we look ahead in 2023, even though so much has changed and it\u2019ll land differently than we thought. The initial thought is, yes, the parameters we laid out for you, although they were incredibly audacious and although they didn\u2019t anticipate some of the changes that have hit the market since then, look to us to be on track including things like the EBITDA range we shared, the revenue range that we shared, the customer aspirations, the cash flow aspirations, and therefore, the share buyback potential in our plan and also the CapEx outlook. All those things look to us like, roughly the right answers, even though so much has changed. And that's one of the things that makes our story so different than the other stories out there in tech and in telecom. Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. As I reflect back on Analyst Day, what we said is there's a lot of opportunity and, to your point, Mike, so much has changed. When we just think about where the macroeconomic situation is now, certainly, I can rattle off a lot of things that have changed since then such as the DISH relationship and our ability to secure a long-term arrangement that while it's under the Analyst Day assumptions, it still secures about three quarters of that revenue. But we've had so much success in the business as well. The share-taking that we anticipated has happened. What we've seen from Magenta MAX as a tailwind from an ARPA and ARPU perspective has been just tremendous. And we talked about how a lot of the inflationary impacts \u2013 well, of course, they're happening on the edges in terms of bad debt, in the macroeconomic environment and labor. And you saw the moves that we made early on to address labor with our rate changes. We've been insulated from a lot of that because, again, I think a lot of the brilliant moves that were done on the part of Neville and team to secure just long-term arrangements with a lot of our large cost categories. So in a sense, as you said, Mike, so much of the world has changed since then. And there's been so many puts and takes. But the success of this team gives us confidence in achieving those audacious goals that we set out there for 2023. And we're looking forward, obviously. This is not the time to update 2023 guide. I'd like to. Maybe I can treat that later. But what we'll do is we'll, of course, update you on that at our Q4 call and looking forward to that.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: You guys hear me, okay?\nMike Sievert: Yes.\nBrett Feldman: Okay. Great. Kind of a follow-up on network. You nudged up your CapEx guidance for the year. You talked about accelerating the build-out of the 5G network and also the sensitivity to the high-speed Internet routers. And so the bigger picture question is, from this point forward, now that you've completed the network integration, what are the principal drivers of your network CapEx? What's it most sensitive to? And to what extent is it going to be increasingly sensitive to your traction with fixed wireless? Or put another way, if you keep putting up over 0.5 million net adds a quarter, does that inevitably mean you're going to have to keep nudging up CapEx? Or do you think you're at a run rate to support that growth right now? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yes, I'll start. No, it doesn't mean that. And because, again, our business plan on fixed wireless is essentially an incremental capital free plan. Now if we look at \u2013 to the previous question about we're learning and there's opportunity and we're growing increasingly confident, if we look at that fixed wireless space and decide to augment our capital-free business plan with an additional business plan that's burdened with some capital, we'll let you know about that. We won't surprise you with that. But that's something we wouldn't completely rule out because we have great assets. We've barely tapped our millimeter wave assets. We have fantastic mid-band. The recent auction has given us potential access soon as soon as those licenses are assigned to significant additional mid-band in areas where we actually already have the towers deployed. And that's fascinating. Well, this is the first auction that's like that where our winning bids, when they are assigned, we have already deployed the radios to \u2013 by the end of this year to 13,000 towers, reaching 45 million people. It's like flipping a switch. Neville is going \u2013 it's not like flipping a switch. For me, it's like flipping a switch.\nNeville Ray: Almost.\nMike Sievert: It's almost immediate because the radios are there, and they're not allowed to transmit into the white spaces that we just want in the auction. So we're very anxious to see those being assigned. And the FCC did a great job getting this auction done, and I know they'll do a great job getting the process completed. So that \u2013 so the answer to the fixed wireless and capital is no, unless we see an additional business because to the very first question in the call, it's not something that is predicated on capital or on capacity. Our core plan is going to add a lot more capacity as Neville moves from that 120 to the 200 he commented about a few minutes ago. Anybody want to add to that?\nNeville Ray: I'll just add quickly. I mean, obviously, the modernization of the network continues on, but we've achieved so much to date. I mean we're way ahead of our competition. I mean we're not in \u2013 we're majority complete on our network modernization and the addition of those mid-band radios. We still have more to do, and that's going to continue into 2023 and 2024, and that will continue to open up more opportunity, as we referenced earlier, for fixed wireless. I think the other piece we will continue to make, coverage investments. These networks continue to grow. Customer demands continue to grow. We have great growth, as Callie referenced in our business and enterprise space. We need to feed that. We've got work to do still in small town rural America. So our CapEx profile is feeding both. It's all back to delivering that overall best network experience. And it's the combination of 5G. And everything we add on coverage is 5G capable, of course. So the network, as Mike K. referenced earlier on, is all about 5G. And we have a great leadership position, and our plan as we go forward is to extend that.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. All right. Let's go back to the phone.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: I think this is the last question. You tell me, Jud. Yes, timing wise.\nJud Henry: We'll take one more.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. So we'll go back to the phone. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. And that question will come from David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hi, guys. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Dave.\nDavid Barden: Hi, Mike. Thank you for taking my questions. So I guess two, if I could. I mean the first would be, I guess, for Peter, which is presupposing, we get to this point where T-Mobile shares are over $150 a share. We have this 48.8 million shares that we're going to issue to SoftBank, and you've got this buyback. And you've left a lot of options on the table for how you can use that buyback to use open market operations or structured buybacks. I was wondering if you could kind of share with the market a little bit of your thinking about how to address that overhang and what the \u2013 what SoftBank's potential selling of those shares could mean for T-Mobile? And then if I could, the second question, Mike, would be \u2013 Verizon advertised at the very beginning of this quarter that they were going to have a big churn bubble and that, that would contribute a lot of switchers to the market and that they expect that, that's going to change in the fourth quarter. Could you address kind of how you think that \"churn bubble\" affected your performance in the third quarter? And how we should think about the fourth quarter as that unfolds? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Great. Well, maybe we'll have Peter start with the first one. I'll just give you a premise on it, which is ever since we wrote this business plan during the merger and then gave you our outlooks for what we thought we could accomplish, we've always been assuming that, that dilution event is coming because it's only $150 where it would trigger, and that's all the way out to, what, 2025, I think. And so our minds have always been, yes, that's on its way. It's sort of nothing new. I hope we're right about that. But maybe, Peter, you can talk about the question, which is how do we address the overhang, and is there any interplay with the share buyback? And then we'll get to the second piece about share.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Absolutely. And as you'd expect, Dave, obviously, we consider all of those things. But frankly, there's no serious discussion happening around that now. And that's probably because you'll have to ask SoftBank, but I would assume that they much like we assume that this was going to happen, right? And that delivery on this plan and those audacious goals that we gave out to you would achieve $150 a share. And so there really are no significant ongoing discussions at the moment around that, probably because that's exactly what SoftBank assumes. So \u2013 and I got to tell you, we're just \u2013 we're so pleased on being able to start that share buyback earlier on the success of the integration progress, the business progress as well as achieving core family investment-grade rating and to be able to begin a significant share buyback program early. Now I will remind you on the SoftBank shares, that $48.8 million, it does come with some restrictions. You were asking me about what happens in terms of them selling those shares, and we hope they'll be long-term holders with us, but that's a question for them. But there are restrictions on their ability to sell those shares. That's part of the agreement between them and DT that's public out there. For example, they can't sell any of those shares at DT is not at 51% ownership at a minimum. There's a certain amount they can't sell through the end of 2024 no matter what. They have some ability to monetize a portion of those shares, not via sale, but other mechanics that they might employ, but there's some restrictions there that everybody should keep in mind in terms of the SoftBank shares.\nMike Sievert: Right. And then on the churn bubble, look, I mean time will tell whether or not what we're seeing in the competitive dynamic is long-term or short-term. I mean to us, these last few quarters have looked like really consistent competitive mill use. Yes, it's very competitive out there. Yes, our competitors sort of stepped in it by jacking people up with price increases while they're stuck into phone payment plans and surprising them that way. And I do think, by the way, that there's a difference in philosophy between our companies. Our company is absolutely obsessed with the power of our brand. And for a decade now, we have been building fame and trust as the company that puts you first those customers, that gives you the best value and that changes the rules of this industry in your favor. And our competitors saw inflation as an excuse to go grab some short-term money and said, don't worry, it'll all be over in a few weeks. I mean some people will leave, and there will be a bubble, but then it's all over. And of course, it's not all over. People don't forget that. That's the power of brand. And we've shown that for a decade now what happens when you gain fame as a customer advocate. We're all duking it out on the network side now that T-Mobile has become competitive, and we've got the best 5G, and that's rapidly transforming into the best network. And you could say that perception-wise, there is a lot of similarity these days. It's not even close on value and customer trust and Net Promoter Score. We're up this year. They're down. Our fame for having the best value is twice theirs. It's not even close, and they made it worse this year. And so we'll see how that unfolds. Yes, I bet you that there will be some short-term effects that may be the initial onslaught of people leaving because of what they did to their customers might slow down. But in terms of the word-of-mouth value and the ability for us to perpetuate our ongoing success built on our fame is the customer advocate that gets better and better with the passage of time because they're carriers, and we're the un-carrier.\nDavid Barden: That's great. Thank you so much, Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. And Jud, is that all the time we got?\nJud Henry: That is all the time we have today. But again, we really appreciate everybody joining us. If you have any other questions, please reach out to the Investor Relations or Media Relations team, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you everyone.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile third quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. It's such a pleasure to watch this team reliably deliver on our commitments, and we did it yet again with another strong quarter in Q3. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customer accounts resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth once again, up 7% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on driving profitability translated at strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, into year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 11%. That increase in customers and profitability is driving industry-leading operating and free cash flow expansion and further unlocks the massive cash flow potential of our business. These robust operating results also enabled us to achieve two major financial milestones. First, we're extremely proud to have reached an investment-grade rating from all three major agencies, opening access to a much deeper and cost effective capital pool for the company. We also closed our first asset-backed securities issuance related to our equipment receivables, which provides yet another established and attractive capital source as we continue to be opportunistic in optimizing both our capital structure and cost. And second, as Mike mentioned, we commenced the significant share repurchase program in September, and we repurchased 4.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $669 million in Q3. Cumulatively, through October 20th, we have repurchased 10.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $1.5 billion. Also in Q3, we announced the planned sale of our wireline business, which resulted in a pretax loss of $1.1 billion that had substantially no cash impact to the quarter. This includes the financial liability associated with the commercial take-or-pay, the impairment to the carrying value of the associated assets and other cost to sell. The transaction is not expected to have any material financial impact to 2023 based on the expected closing timeline. All right, let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6.2 million and 6.4 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on a reducing churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds, coming from phones for the full year. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA, we now expect full year 2022 to be between $26.2 billion and $26.4 billion, up 11% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and increased merger synergies. Core adjusted EBITDA excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, up $250 million at the midpoint, primarily as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA are expected to be between $4.8 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network decommissioning activities. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger-related costs, are now expected to be in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion, which is up $200 million at the midpoint, reflecting the ongoing robust pace of our 5G deployment and success in high speed internet where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion, higher by $50 million at the midpoint. This results in free cash flow increasing by more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investments and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 17% and 19% based on favorability, primarily from non-recurring benefits we've seen year-to-date. Additionally, we continue to expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value added services, including Magenta MAX. And with greater success in attracting new to T-Mobile customers with high speed internet, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up in the mid-to-high 2% range. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Yes. Well there hasn't been a lot of that yet Craig. I mean, we announced our transaction with Columbia Capital that again, is subject to regulatory approval and would close six months thereafter. But again, as I think about the long-term trajectory of this business, we laid out obviously our set of mid- and long-term aspirations in Analyst Day, and there are some service revenue margins that are inferred from there. But this has been a question that's come up multiple times in terms of the competitive set and where do we land relative to the competitive set. And the most important thing to look at, because it is what powers the growth of the ability to both return shareholder to capital, to invest further in the business and to continue this flywheel success is how are you able to translate that service revenue into free cash flow? And that's where we're tremendously proud and excited about the opportunity ahead of us. And you see, even with our Analyst Day projections for 2023, even before we get the full run rate cash potential of this business in the later periods, we're projected to convert service revenue into free cash flow as a leader in this industry. And so that's really what we're laser-focused on. It gets rid of the question of leased fiber versus owned fiber, takes all that noise out of it and really shows you the value creation capability of this business. I might just say one or two things to emphasize a couple that you said. 5G is more and more becoming the network. And so one of the ways that we're measuring our success in 5G is how are we succeeding in overall network perception, how are people perceiving that T-Mobile competes overall in the marketplace against our two main competitors. And I think increasingly, you're seeing us close the perception gap. You're also seeing us win awards for overall network leadership that we had never won before, and Neville can double-click into some of those. I think the way that we'll continue to talk about this is coverage in places where customers really care about and with our Coverage Beyond move, we've featured coverage both on the ground, the best 5G network, and increasingly, the best network when you're on the ground, covered when you're in the air and covered internationally. And I think you'll start to see more and more of these use cases emerge about experiences that both businesses and consumers can appreciate as we progress over the next couple of years that we'll feature and talk a little bit more about the kinds of experiences that could be unlocked by a leading network. Final words to quantify that for you. Now that 5G usage is most of the usage and 5G devices are most of the devices, we're seeing our 5G lead take root, not just in reputation and reality, but in quantitative measures. So for example, the Ookla data that came back said our average customer is experiencing speeds twice as fast as just a year ago, average customer, regardless of device type, and twice as fast as they can get from AT&T or Verizon. And that's very powerful because they noticed that, and they tell other people about it. Did you have a follow-up question? I was just starting to hear you jump in. Perfect. So I'll let Jon talk about Magenta Max. But really, I mean, the trajectory of ARPU has just been just such a success this year. And when you think about the history of T-Mobile and even the plans that we had anticipated during Analyst Day when we came out, the ability to have Magenta Max be such a tailwind and allow us to get to the point where we're increasing ARPU guidance year-over-year and expecting a 2% increase is just phenomenal. But at the same time, as you know, ARPU is very much a mix-driven metric. And one of the reasons why we're so focused on ARPU itself, and just some of the examples are, of course, as you deepen relationships, for example, with our Sprint customers, as we saw migration happen, we had an opportunity to expand relationships. And so while that second, third, fourth line is obviously a lower ARPU and can impact blended ARPU, it's tremendously accretive from a CLV perspective. So that's one. In business where you're seeing some of the success in business, large enterprise, obviously, has a lower blended ARPU basis than what you typically see, but it's a tremendously CLV accretive business to bring in. Our segmentation approach, 55-plus that's bringing in such a significant amount of prime customers and driving switching is another one where you see ARPU may be mixture differently than what we see on a blended average, but high CLVs. And so that's part of the reason why you've always heard us focus on ARPA and the strategy to land and continue to expand the relationships, both with more phones, but also beyond the phone, such as with fixed wireless. And that's where we're seeing mid to high 2% year-over-year increase in ARPA. So that gives me a lot of comfort there. And I do think with ARPU, you're going to see a mixture of things happen. But Magenta Max has just been such a great tailwind. And I'd love to give Jon the opportunity to brag about it a little. Yes. So let me start with bad debt and consumer behavior. As you know, year-over-year, certainly you saw bad debt increase from the more muted pandemic-related conditions. And we're seeing involve churn roughly normalized to pre-pandemic levels. 2019 levels, which was actually our best year pre-pandemic and it's exactly what we foreshadowed for you in Q2. We did see bad debt sequentially step down and we do believe Q2 was the high water mark in terms of percentage of total revenue from a bad debt perspective. So we're seeing exactly what we anticipated seeing there. Remember, this is a core strength of ours and we'll continue to work with consumers. To your point, is it an opportunity set? Yes, I think that's another thing we've talked about before. And we see a continued, as Jon mentioned, really, really strong uptake on our highest featured rate plan. And we're also seeing, as you see, tremendous uptake on high speed internet, both within our current base, but also with new to T-Mobile relationships that then allow us to expand beyond that. So that's a lot of, I think what we're seeing very, very optimistic about those trends. And I hope I had all the questions for you. Is there anything, Simon? Yes. Well, this is another one where we've been saying for the longest time, we do believe ultimately the industry growth were normalized. And that was always in our plans. It's always continues to be in our plans. But remember the differentiator for us is that not only do we have this tremendous combination of the value proposition and our fame for value and the 5G network leadership that is turning into overall network leadership. But it's also combined, those two things combined with the tremendous growth opportunities that are again, differentiated for us that Mike spoke about earlier. Network seekers in the top 100 are expansion in smaller markets and rural areas, TFB and the success that we're continuing to see there. So for us, we believe we're going to continue to take share because of that combination of value and network and the differentiated growth opportunities, despite the fact that we do anticipate the industry will normalize. And the proof as we continue to deliver is in the results, right? Our highest ever postpaid account net ads, a true measure of switching and relationships and the ability to land those and grow those now, you know, in the mid to high 2% range for ARPA. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. I don't know Mike, if there's anything to add thoughts? Yes. As I reflect back on Analyst Day, what we said is there's a lot of opportunity and, to your point, Mike, so much has changed. When we just think about where the macroeconomic situation is now, certainly, I can rattle off a lot of things that have changed since then such as the DISH relationship and our ability to secure a long-term arrangement that while it's under the Analyst Day assumptions, it still secures about three quarters of that revenue. But we've had so much success in the business as well. The share-taking that we anticipated has happened. What we've seen from Magenta MAX as a tailwind from an ARPA and ARPU perspective has been just tremendous. And we talked about how a lot of the inflationary impacts \u2013 well, of course, they're happening on the edges in terms of bad debt, in the macroeconomic environment and labor. And you saw the moves that we made early on to address labor with our rate changes. We've been insulated from a lot of that because, again, I think a lot of the brilliant moves that were done on the part of Neville and team to secure just long-term arrangements with a lot of our large cost categories. So in a sense, as you said, Mike, so much of the world has changed since then. And there's been so many puts and takes. But the success of this team gives us confidence in achieving those audacious goals that we set out there for 2023. And we're looking forward, obviously. This is not the time to update 2023 guide. I'd like to. Maybe I can treat that later. But what we'll do is we'll, of course, update you on that at our Q4 call and looking forward to that. Yes. Absolutely. And as you'd expect, Dave, obviously, we consider all of those things. But frankly, there's no serious discussion happening around that now. And that's probably because you'll have to ask SoftBank, but I would assume that they much like we assume that this was going to happen, right? And that delivery on this plan and those audacious goals that we gave out to you would achieve $150 a share. And so there really are no significant ongoing discussions at the moment around that, probably because that's exactly what SoftBank assumes. So \u2013 and I got to tell you, we're just \u2013 we're so pleased on being able to start that share buyback earlier on the success of the integration progress, the business progress as well as achieving core family investment-grade rating and to be able to begin a significant share buyback program early. Now I will remind you on the SoftBank shares, that $48.8 million, it does come with some restrictions. You were asking me about what happens in terms of them selling those shares, and we hope they'll be long-term holders with us, but that's a question for them. But there are restrictions on their ability to sell those shares. That's part of the agreement between them and DT that's public out there. For example, they can't sell any of those shares at DT is not at 51% ownership at a minimum. There's a certain amount they can't sell through the end of 2024 no matter what. They have some ability to monetize a portion of those shares, not via sale, but other mechanics that they might employ, but there's some restrictions there that everybody should keep in mind in terms of the SoftBank shares."

            "content": "Yes. We couldn't be more pleased with what's happened with Magenta Max. I mean when you think about all of our new accounts that are joining T-Mobile, we're having north of 60% of our new bands choosing Magenta Max. And like what Mike said just a few moments ago, it's our most popular plan for not only new customers that are joining, but also existing customers who are changing the rate plans. We're still under 20% of our total base on Magenta Max. So with what Peter was saying just a few moments ago, we still have tailwinds and opportunities still within our base, not only for the business benefits that, that represents, but also for the incredible consumer benefits that it represents as well. You got to remember, too, that when you look at Magenta Max, for customers with two lines or more, it's $225 per month in savings and value that consumers get. And when you think about this inflation, pressured budget cycle that so many households are in and you think about what we're doing with Apple TV+ now included on Magenta Max, Netflix included, all of the Wi-Fi included on airplanes, think about taxes and fees, that's something that we talked about and rolled out some number of years ago, I think at the beginning of 2017. That's 15% to 18% of the bill with our competitors that's completely included within our value proposition on the Magenta Max. So our customers are loving it. Like Mike said, there's incredible utility, 5x more gaming, 2.5x more social media, 2x more video, including all those emerging technologies that Mike was referring to just a few moments ago, an augmented reality and virtual reality as well. So our customers are loving it. We have a lot more opportunity still to go within Magenta Max, but we're feeling great and just could not be more pleased with the overall performance of that particular rate card."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mike. I can't \u2013 and Roger, thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. I can't speak too much to AT&T and Verizon, but I do see the TAM expanding. Mike, we see in business this year, mobile subs are expected to grow by 4.6%. A third of all business subs will have a 5G connection by the end of 2022. IoT connections are expected to grow by 16%. And of course, private networks and managed services are supposed to be well over 44% CAGR year-over-year. We see work-from-home as a category expander, and we see companies that are providing employee lines to have less than 10% attrition. So this is a benefit that they're coming and talking to us about. And then when we see regulation and some of the environment from the SEC, maintaining and providing secure electronic communications allows us to expand our product portfolio and the way that we're delivering solutions. So there's a lot of really great and interesting opportunity for us. We're having a lot of conversations. And then, Roger, to your question, our revenue in enterprise is up 20% year-over-year. In SMB, we're seeing double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter. In our offering for business Internet, which is really the only 5G nationwide fixed wireless solution, we've seen double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter for four quarters in a row. So in this last particular quarter in automotive and in airlines, those verticals we saw a lot of growth. We signed the deal with VinFast, which is a global EV manufacturer. Ford, we announced a partnership for our Advanced Network Solutions. We won with Boeing, Delta, a partnership with our SMRA growth in consumer, let us win in rural America with Tractor Supply, which is America's largest rural retailer where we started with fixed wireless and have the opportunity to land and expand. So in the public sector as well, Roger, we're seeing great deals with Dallas ISD, Chicago PD, the IRS. So it really is a pretty exciting time for business. Overall, across several different product categories outside of only voice and then we're in SMB, we're continuing to see growth there."

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes, I'll just build on your comments, Mike. I would say, Jonathan, the reverse is happening. We are just coming off the back of a tremendous quarter, actually our busiest quarter since close of the merger with Sprint. In terms of how many sites we modernized and upgraded with mid-band 5G. And so the footprint is expanding which is tremendous. We're also adding more spectrum across the footprint, both the existing and the new footprint. And that's not just in 2.5 gigahertz now, we're also adding PCS in the 1900 megahertz band to those sites. So we have more sites and more spectrum coming online as we move through the future months and years for the company. And it's not just that, right. The other great piece is that 5G is becoming more efficient. We are rapidly moving to all SA, all standalone. And what does that mean? It means we can leverage and transport all of that home internet traffic on a pure 5G lane. So that's more efficient, it's more spectrally efficient. And from a performance perspective, of course, we get better latency. So we are still in the early innings of rolling out this mid-band network. Obviously we have a tremendous leadership position, but in terms of our ability to support the numbers we've talked about by 2025, we're in a good place. And as Mike said, we will continue to work to see if we can beat those opportunities. Yes, I'll hit these quick, Mike. So we've talked about how we've effectively completed our network integration. And a big part of that was not just decom, it was incorporating literally thousands upon thousands of Sprint sites into the T-Mobile network. And that's the definition of this term that's used at keep sites. And that work is in the majority now complete too. So this last quarter, a lot of decom, a lot of these keep sites were upgraded and brought on air. And so we've made \u2013 it was just a cracking quarter for us with all the 5G build too. So really, really pleased to have the vast majority of all of that work behind us. And now we can move on with continued expansion of coverage and performance in 5G. Thankfully, I have a great team. Thank you, guys. But yes, I think last quarter, Mike was the busiest network quarter in the company's history. I don't think we've ever seen the level of delivery and performance on decom, on new sites, on modernization. It was a remarkable set of performance characteristics. And there was an intense focus from the team on obviously churn management, but more importantly the customer experience throughout that process. And as we moved into 2022, we were way, way better at executing on the plan. We put together some time back. Quickly on voice over NR. So we always seem to forget to bring voice along with the next generation of technology. We've done it multiple times now. But I see us as in a leader leadership position globally. We have a voice over NR, so 5G voice live in several markets. We continue to test, we continue to optimize. Why is that important? It's important because we want to have all of our traffic, all of that customer experience on a 5G lane. Today, we have to drop our customers down off of that 5G lane onto LTE. And we've talked before about how we see our business as an all 5G network and having VoNR and that voice service is critical to executing on that strategy and making sure we have a full 5G network with full standalone capability. So we're making progress, still got work to do. I'm not going to say it's where we want it to be yet. But I'm confident over the next couple of quarters we will materially expand that footprint. Almost. I'll just add quickly. I mean, obviously, the modernization of the network continues on, but we've achieved so much to date. I mean we're way ahead of our competition. I mean we're not in \u2013 we're majority complete on our network modernization and the addition of those mid-band radios. We still have more to do, and that's going to continue into 2023 and 2024, and that will continue to open up more opportunity, as we referenced earlier, for fixed wireless. I think the other piece we will continue to make, coverage investments. These networks continue to grow. Customer demands continue to grow. We have great growth, as Callie referenced in our business and enterprise space. We need to feed that. We've got work to do still in small town rural America. So our CapEx profile is feeding both. It's all back to delivering that overall best network experience. And it's the combination of 5G. And everything we add on coverage is 5G capable, of course. So the network, as Mike K. referenced earlier on, is all about 5G. And we have a great leadership position, and our plan as we go forward is to extend that."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Thanks everybody. Very welcome to our third quarter call and thanks for tuning in. It is so great to be back to talk about another quarter of outstanding results by this team. Our differentiated strategy is working. Our ongoing focus on delivering the best value while simultaneously capitalizing on our network leadership position has delivered another quarter of industry leading growth in customers, EBITDA and cash flow, and we are raising our 2022 guidance for the third consecutive quarter this year. All of this while completing our biggest integration milestone, I am incredibly proud of this team. As we told you when our merger closed, our plan was to expand on our fame as the industry's best value while building and becoming known for having the best network in the country, finally giving customers the ability to have both from one provider for the first time ever. Now just 2.5 years later, we're doing exactly what we planned. Our brand strength for value leadership has never been better. And it's been further aided by our competitors' price increases. And our long-established 5G lead is translating to overall network leadership for the first time and giving customers the beginnings of really a powerful network that they're really noticing. Our results this quarter are a clear demonstration of how differentiated and sustainable our growth strategy really is. Only T-Mobile has both this unique combination of network and value leadership and multiple large scale new and underpenetrated segments to tap into. To grow our business, we are also driving innovation where it matters most for customers. Through Magenta MAX, our most popular plan and the best expression of T-Mobile's 5G network, we're providing features that are meaningful to customers in their daily lives like with the recent addition of Apple TV+ and our Un-carrier move, Coverage Beyond. Well, we're not just keeping people connected on the ground, but also in the air and when they go abroad. With the launch of Easy Switch and Network Pass, we're making it simple and risk-free to experience our network and make the switch to T-Mobile. It has long been established that T-Mobile is the 5G leader. But with the rapidly growing adoption of 5G by consumers and businesses, we're now seeing that 5G lead translate into overall network leadership. And to back it up, we're beginning to win more third-party recognition for our network leadership from multiple third parties like Ookla, umlaut and PC Magazine. This is precisely the network evolution that we planned. We knew that 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that's exactly what is now unfolding. And speaking of network, we just hit our biggest merger integration milestone. By the end of Q3, we had successfully decommissioned substantially all targeted Sprint macro sites, more than a year earlier than our original merger plan. And our Ultra Capacity 5G now reaches 250 million Americans. Think about that. Today, we're already where Verizon hopes to be more than two years from now. And we're not stopping. We recognize the importance of coverage to customers, and we will continue to pursue more opportunities to ensure our network is there for them whenever and wherever they need us. This lean and data informed customer driven coverage approach will guide us as we enhance and expand our network to even higher levels and in a capital efficient way using our spectrum resources. We also recognize that there are some places where it's just not practical for any wireless operator to build a terrestrial network. But because we want T-Mobile customers to have peace of mind that we have them covered no matter where they go, in Q3, we announced our joint effort with SpaceX to do just that, combining a slice of our mid-band spectrum that's already compatible with existing customer devices with next-gen satellite technology from SpaceX. Our goal is for T-Mobile customers to be connected anywhere in the U.S. where they can see the sky. Overall, this differentiated growth strategy and emerging network leadership produced another quarter of truly differentiated results. So let's get right into them. In Q3, we posted a record 394,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry again. Winning the switching decisions in this industry and growing share through our core growth strategies I've outlined for you many times is the central growth ambition of our company. In this quarter, we did that better than ever before. In addition, our network and value proposition are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, which is contributing to an all-time high in our customer prime mix. And we delivered an industry-best 1.6 million postpaid net additions, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. We had our highest postpaid phone net adds since the merger with an industry-leading 854,000. Our postpaid phone churn of just 0.88% improved 8 basis points from last year. Once again, we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. And our postpaid phone churn, including Sprint, was lower than Verizon's for the second consecutive quarter. And as I said, our multiple growth opportunities are all contributing to this success. Consider smaller markets and rural areas, which include 40% of the U.S. population, at the end of last year, we only had a competitive network and distribution to effectively compete in 30% of those households. Today, thanks to our accelerated network build. We have already surpassed our year-end target to compete in 50% of these households and we now expect to reach roughly 60% by the end of this year. We also continue to grow in the top 100 markets as we win the prime network seekers who are increasingly recognizing that T-Mobile has the best network for them, an audience we never effectively competed for in the past. We achieved share leadership in many of these markets in the past without winning on network. All of that is changing. So the same advantages in network and value proposition that are driving growth in smaller markets and rural areas where we're underpenetrated and are driving it in the top 100 where we've always been strong. In fact, our net account growth in the quarter was split roughly equally between these two geographic segments. Okay. Let's talk business. We continue to win business customers from incumbents as T-Mobile for Business continues to build momentum, delivering one of our highest ever postpaid phone net addition quarters in Q3. The impact we're having can be clearly seen in Verizon's business churn, which was up again at the highest levels they've ever reported. Meanwhile, we added more business accounts and had lower business phone churn than Verizon in the quarter, delivering one of our lowest ever postpaid phone churn quarters for business. Our 5G network leadership, particularly as it relates to our lead in advanced 5G services, is increasingly enabling us to become a strategic partner for enterprises and for government agencies. Okay. Let me briefly touch on high-speed Internet where additions of 578,000 hit another record high. And once again, we expect to lead the industry in net adds. In fact, I anticipate that T-Mobile had more broadband net additions than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the second quarter in a row. In addition, our high-speed Internet attracted consumers and businesses who are new to T-Mobile at an increasing pace, establishing new relationships that we can grow with additional products and services over time. In just 1.5 years since our commercial launch, we now serve more than 2 million customers with Net Promoter Scores more than 30 points higher than cable and even higher than the average fiber provider. These results demonstrate that our differentiated growth strategy and our Un-carrier playbook to provide customers with the best value and the best network continues to win, and our differentiation is a particular source of strength in this ever-changing competitive and macroeconomic environment. And importantly, we translated our leading customer growth into industry-leading financial growth in postpaid service revenues, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. This momentum has enabled us to raise our guidance every quarter this year, including today. Finally, as you know, thanks to our strong execution and confidence in the future, our Board authorized a substantial share repurchase program and did so earlier than our initial Analyst Day plans to begin in 2023. I could not be prouder of this team and of these results. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and some more information on our guidance. Not at all. In fact, the capacity picture is actually more sector by sector than market by market, and that's sort of what makes it different than other models. Just to kind of remind everybody how this works. So we took the entire country and looked at every sector of every tower and predicted mobile usage for years to come through share taking and additional mobile usage per device. And then looked at each sector, whether or not to approve addresses in that sector. And then once we get enough addresses in that sector, which is very rarely achieved so far, we stop approving addresses in that sector And so it's not really a market-by-market basis. And it's also therefore not a model that requires us to allocate significant extra capital, meaning we can go after this market very, very cost effectively because the network is substantially complete only for mobile usage. It's just a fantastic model. When we laid that out for people in 2021, we said that we saw that particular model getting us to six to eight million postpaid homes, and that would be about the model. But that doesn't mean we might not go beyond that. We'll have to watch how it all unfolds. And we just really like this run rate, it's competitive, it's rapidly growing. I love the fact that the premise of your question is why the slowdown only as many net adds as AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined, what's going wrong with your model? It's a fantastic place for us to be. But the answer to your question specifically is no, other than in some particular neighborhoods where we have lots of neighbors all joining on at once, we're not seeing any issues with capacity. And remember, and I'll ask Neville to finish this answer, we're only getting started when it relates to applying the capacity. It's not a finite quantum. In fact, right now we have 120 megahertz is it deployed in the mid-band ultra-capacity? And we're on our way to 200. Maybe you can talk about the journey because it's not a fixed capacity story. One thing I love about this \u2013 just to wrap it is that I mentioned this in my remarks, but the net promoter scores that we're seeing on this product are just fantastic. And people love this product because it's lower price and because it does exactly what it promises. And for us it's really, really important that we keep all of that in balance on our journey to millions and millions of home served. So great. Thanks, Jonathan. All right, next question. Okay, great. Let's start with the second question about bringing on leased spectrum, what's the margin trajectory, where can margins get, I'll start with Peter. Yes, just back to the consumer question, I'd be interested if anybody else wants to jump in. Ultimately consumers and businesses want an available signal and where they have available signal, they want speed and capacity, and they want that at a great price from a company that will treat them right and love them. And that's the bottom line. Our lead in 5G puts us in a position now that 5G is becoming the norm to be the leader in overall network. And network is one of the top two reasons why people switch. They switch either because they are not satisfied with the price or the terms around those prices, or they switch because they want a different or more powerful network signal. And more and more they are learning that T-Mobile is the company that offers that. Remember all the companies now provide signal just about everywhere people go. The question is when you are moving around, what kind of signal do you have? When you walk into buildings are you begging for a Wi-Fi password or do you have T-Mobile where your signal is probably faster than the Wi-Fi in the building you just walked into? And that kind of thing is habit forming. We're seeing usage move really fast. The most popular plan we have, and as I said, the best expression of our 5G network is Magenta MAX. It's now our most popular plan, and people are using it significantly more than they were using prior plans, and certainly more than they were using LTE, like several times more. And so, those are the kinds of things that, I think, people look to. It's applications like gaming, it's media consumption, it's the emergence of new use cases like AR and VR that are the underpinnings of the metaverse. No matter what you believe about how the metaverse might or might not unfold, clearly more immersive 3D experiences are on their way. And all those things require ultra-high capacity, low latency, powerful network signals. And that's what T-Mobile uniquely provides with our 5G advantage. The last thing I'll say, and I know your question was about consumers, is that businesses don't just go on the reputation. They actually go have a look at it. They take a 100 or so phones from each of the providers and test it for some weeks. And our win share is like it's never been. And so it really shows you that when they take a hard look at where all their customers go, where their employees go, and they look at it side by side, they come back. And more times than not and certainly more times than the past, it's T-Mobile. So we're really at the beginnings of, I think, this 5G revolution taking hold. Anybody want to add to that? Well, I mean, if you total the people that we reach right now, it's 250 million with Ultra Capacity. And with C-band and other forms of Ultra Wideband as Verizon calls it, that's where they hope to be by their public disclosures over two years from now. And so years ago, I said we were two years ahead in this 5G race. And in two years, we'd still be two years ahead. That continues to appear to be the case, even though our competitors are now in rapid deployment of their C-band assets. And of course, they are different assets. Ours is underpinned on one 5G network with a 5G stand-alone core by a massive low-band 5G network that reaches 97% of Americans. And that's a huge difference maker as well, and we see it in all kinds of scenarios, including even the resiliency of our network. When issues happen with a storm or something, we can beam in from miles away and save the day with a very high capacity 5G signal on low-band. And those things are very important to our customers, they notice. Hi, John. Okay. Great. I'm going to go turn to, just so you have a heads up, to Peter and to Jon on ARPU and Magenta Max. On churn, I'll just personalize it. I'm not going to be satisfied until we're the lowest. Magenta was the lowest. Right now, we're number two on churn. I want to be number one. And we have the best network and the best value and a team that loves its customers. We should make our way to number one. I can't really outlook for you the journey because it's a competitive marketplace. Our competitors aren't standing still. I respect them. But I think with our team and our assets and our unique proposition, we should be number one. We're not going to probably be unpacking it for you a lot more than that. We used to do that here's the T-Mobile and give you some color on the churn and how many people and Sprint starting to look just like Magenta now, et cetera, because the premise of your question was accurate. We've shut down the Sprint network. We hope the billing migration that happens in 2023 will be largely invisible to customers. And so yes, we have a lot of work to do. We need to get them under commitment. We need to get them on the right plans, give them the full uncarrier benefit. There's some improvement we can undertake still, but it's one customer base. And we're going to be focused on how do we improve churn for that one customer base, and I won't be satisfied until we're number one. Okay. So turning to ARPU and ARPU development and Magenta Max and what we're hearing from customers, Peter and Jon. Okay. Before we go back to the phone, I want to go out to Twitter where we're seeing questions come in. We have a question from Roger Entner and a similar one from @LinkedIn, right. So I'll go with Roger's version. So it's a question for Callie Field and TFB. In what business sector do you see the most success? Where are you gaining traction? Is it SMB, midsize or large enterprises? And maybe I'll also add to the question, Callie, because all of the competitors said in their calls, business is going fine. Business is going fine. So what's going on? We just said business is going fine. How can it be going fine for everybody? So maybe if you can answer both. So two things are happening, right. So one, we're taking their share. That's just very clearly happening, and that's exactly what we told you would happen because of the superior network and the better value. But secondly, the pressure is a little bit being taken off of our competitors, which I think is a good thing, by the category expansion that Callie just talked about. And we forecasted this for you a while back. We told you that we thought, because of this really tight labor pool, that employees \u2013 employers would be looking at all kinds of way to retain employees, and great phone plans are certainly one of those. And this hybrid workplace that companies find themselves in has persisted longer than a lot of people predicted. And now with employees distributed outside the office, employee sponsored phone plans become a more important piece. And so you see growth in the sector, which I think takes a little pressure off of the underlying dynamic, which is we're taking their share. Okay. So let's go back to the phone for the next one. Great. I'll have Peter start it off and then I have a couple comments. Well, just that normalization is starting to happen. You see these last couple quarters, overall postpaid growth was more moderate, and yet our performance is fantastic. And so it does underscore what Peter said, which is our strategy isn't actually predicated deeply on category expansion. It's predicated on share taking something we consistently and reliably do quarter after quarter. Now there's \u2013 as I mentioned, there's some pressure being taken off. Prepaid continues to contribute to postpaid but at more modest levels, business expansion is happening. And that's a newer phenomenon. And by the way, that looks to us to be partly incremental. So some people are actually carrying two phones around and so that's good for the category. And we'll have to see what happens. But what's different, of course about our strategy, as Peter said, is that unlike our competitors, we have big growing under penetrated segments where we are positioned to win with the team, the assets and the value proposition that resonates. And we're proving that that's true quarter in and quarter out. I think that's one of the things that makes our story a little different. You bet. Back to the phone. Are you going to force us to Twitter or are you going to bring us in? Okay. All right, funny. All right. So we do have a couple questions that are pending. So looking Neville at the network that we've just finished the substantial shutdown of the Sprint network, we now are one integrated network. But we did keep a lot of the Sprint sites. What percentage of them have been converted and upgraded? And also could you give an update on where we are with VoNR, that's voice over new radio. What that means is voice over 5G kind of like voiceover LTE worked in the LTE days? So it was the single biggest capital deployment quarter of the single biggest year in our business plan for capital. So you should look more tired than you are. So that means you're touching the network with upgrades and decommissionings at the highest rate in our history, while being the only player with year-over-year churn improvements, 8 basis points and beating Verizon for the second quarter in a row. When you touch a network there's people \u2013 some people get affected very temporarily. That's powerful. And it really shows the planfulness of the build that we were able to do that's substantial of a set of improvements and yet simultaneously deliver churn improvements showing that customers are noticing and they're not just noticing pardon our dust, they're noticing improvements. And with that stall tactic \u2013 Neville and I can just bro out on network all afternoon while you guys watch, or if the operator's back, we can take a question. Great. Well, let me start with the second one on fiber. We're in the same place really as we were the last time we talked about this. I think I got asked about this the last time, which is, as a management team, we have a fantastic business model and a fantastic business plan. And we are focused on it. And we love our ability to move fast and serve customers as a wireless pure-play. And it's been a big source of strength. That said we are very open minded about whether our team, our ability to execute, our brand, our in place 5G network could serve broader markets. And so we're of course interested in adjacencies that would very smartly utilize all of those assets, including our physical and digital distribution capabilities. And so we're interested. We haven't drawn any conclusions about it and I really can't answer whether 5G fixed wireless success makes us more interested or less interested. It could be a little of both for the obvious reasons. So you'll have to stay tuned. We're having a look at it. One of the things that we do is we try to learn. We have some partnerships that we're pursuing now called T-Fiber at a very small scale so we can make sure that we're learning. And then of course with \u2013 surprising to many people, but not to us consistent with plan success in 5G, we're also learning a lot about what it takes to be a home broadband operator. I'm very pleased with the net promoter scores that our customers are realizing because many looked at us and said, hey you guys are pretty good at slinging smartphones and taking care of customers on mobile, but could you do that broadband thing? It's different. And we're starting to be able to answer that for ourselves and we're growing some confidence in that. So, no conclusions. We're just a team that hopefully is building trust with you that a, we like our plan, we're confident in our plan, and if we can find accretive smart ways to augment that plan in a way that makes this a better investment for you, we'll look at those things. And we haven't drawn any conclusions. As it relates to the question about 2023 guide. I mean, I'm glad you asked. I might ask Peter to go ahead and lay it all out for you three months early. No, I'll just start and then ask Peter to amplify. The short answer is a lot has changed, but nothing has changed. A lot has changed. We laid out those guidelines for 2023 and beyond in the spring of 2021 and that was a very different world than we now live in. And it's one of the things that's pretty gratifying for us, because as we look ahead in 2023, even though so much has changed and it'll land differently than we thought. The initial thought is, yes, the parameters we laid out for you, although they were incredibly audacious and although they didn't anticipate some of the changes that have hit the market since then, look to us to be on track including things like the EBITDA range we shared, the revenue range that we shared, the customer aspirations, the cash flow aspirations, and therefore, the share buyback potential in our plan and also the CapEx outlook. All those things look to us like, roughly the right answers, even though so much has changed. And that's one of the things that makes our story so different than the other stories out there in tech and in telecom. Peter? Terrific. Thanks, Mike. Hi, Brett. Yes. Yes, I'll start. No, it doesn't mean that. And because, again, our business plan on fixed wireless is essentially an incremental capital free plan. Now if we look at \u2013 to the previous question about we're learning and there's opportunity and we're growing increasingly confident, if we look at that fixed wireless space and decide to augment our capital-free business plan with an additional business plan that's burdened with some capital, we'll let you know about that. We won't surprise you with that. But that's something we wouldn't completely rule out because we have great assets. We've barely tapped our millimeter wave assets. We have fantastic mid-band. The recent auction has given us potential access soon as soon as those licenses are assigned to significant additional mid-band in areas where we actually already have the towers deployed. And that's fascinating. Well, this is the first auction that's like that where our winning bids, when they are assigned, we have already deployed the radios to \u2013 by the end of this year to 13,000 towers, reaching 45 million people. It's like flipping a switch. Neville is going \u2013 it's not like flipping a switch. For me, it's like flipping a switch. It's almost immediate because the radios are there, and they're not allowed to transmit into the white spaces that we just want in the auction. So we're very anxious to see those being assigned. And the FCC did a great job getting this auction done, and I know they'll do a great job getting the process completed. So that \u2013 so the answer to the fixed wireless and capital is no, unless we see an additional business because to the very first question in the call, it's not something that is predicated on capital or on capacity. Our core plan is going to add a lot more capacity as Neville moves from that 120 to the 200 he commented about a few minutes ago. Anybody want to add to that? Terrific. All right. Let's go back to the phone. I think this is the last question. You tell me, Jud. Yes, timing wise. Okay. Great. So we'll go back to the phone. Operator? Hi, Dave. Great. Well, maybe we'll have Peter start with the first one. I'll just give you a premise on it, which is ever since we wrote this business plan during the merger and then gave you our outlooks for what we thought we could accomplish, we've always been assuming that, that dilution event is coming because it's only $150 where it would trigger, and that's all the way out to, what, 2025, I think. And so our minds have always been, yes, that's on its way. It's sort of nothing new. I hope we're right about that. But maybe, Peter, you can talk about the question, which is how do we address the overhang, and is there any interplay with the share buyback? And then we'll get to the second piece about share. Right. And then on the churn bubble, look, I mean time will tell whether or not what we're seeing in the competitive dynamic is long-term or short-term. I mean to us, these last few quarters have looked like really consistent competitive mill use. Yes, it's very competitive out there. Yes, our competitors sort of stepped in it by jacking people up with price increases while they're stuck into phone payment plans and surprising them that way. And I do think, by the way, that there's a difference in philosophy between our companies. Our company is absolutely obsessed with the power of our brand. And for a decade now, we have been building fame and trust as the company that puts you first those customers, that gives you the best value and that changes the rules of this industry in your favor. And our competitors saw inflation as an excuse to go grab some short-term money and said, don't worry, it'll all be over in a few weeks. I mean some people will leave, and there will be a bubble, but then it's all over. And of course, it's not all over. People don't forget that. That's the power of brand. And we've shown that for a decade now what happens when you gain fame as a customer advocate. We're all duking it out on the network side now that T-Mobile has become competitive, and we've got the best 5G, and that's rapidly transforming into the best network. And you could say that perception-wise, there is a lot of similarity these days. It's not even close on value and customer trust and Net Promoter Score. We're up this year. They're down. Our fame for having the best value is twice theirs. It's not even close, and they made it worse this year. And so we'll see how that unfolds. Yes, I bet you that there will be some short-term effects that may be the initial onslaught of people leaving because of what they did to their customers might slow down. But in terms of the word-of-mouth value and the ability for us to perpetuate our ongoing success built on our fame is the customer advocate that gets better and better with the passage of time because they're carriers, and we're the un-carrier. Okay. Great. And Jud, is that all the time we got? Thanks, everybody."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We make -- we provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to the quarter, as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. Also, we are in a quiet period for Auction 108, so we cannot discuss or comment on anything related to the 2.5 gigahertz licenses. And with that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. Well, you can see, if you are watching us live on the web stream, we have got most of our senior team here in New York City today and we are here to share our Q2 results and I am extremely proud of our team for delivering another quarter of great results while completing major integration milestones. Q2 was another strong quarter of industry-leading growth for us in customers, postpaid service revenues and EBITDA, and based on our momentum, we are raising our full year guidance across the board again. This just shows that the Un-carrier playbook, putting customers first and providing them with the best value and the best network, continues to work in a competitive climate and in the changing macroeconomic environment. Before I go into our results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge this challenging economic climate for consumers and businesses and what T-Mobile is doing to help customers stay connected. Inflation has been dominating headlines and dinner table conversations. It\u2019s a reality that millions of American families are facing as prices every day for essentials are skyrocketing all around them. That\u2019s why we did what the Un-carrier does best with three big moves last quarter to help customers when they need it most. Prioritizing customers\u2019 needs is exactly what continues to fuel our growth. Others in the industry notified their customers that their already overpriced bills are going up when they could least afford it. Naturally, some have asked when will T-Mobile raise its rates. Well, building on our proud history as the Un-carrier, our answer is that we are not. Instead, we introduced price lock. We are standing by our commitment to customers and those who switched to T-Mobile that we won\u2019t raise the price of their rate plans. We are here to help broadband customers across the country as well with our recent launch of Internet Freedom. Broadband customers are some of the least satisfied in America, the fees, the contracts, the price hikes, the terrible customer service, it\u2019s all ridiculous and it looks a lot like the wireless industry a decade ago. But it\u2019s all changing because we are making it easy for customers to break up with big Internet, lock in their price and finally feel appreciated. And we made T-Mobile Business Internet available nationwide, which makes T-Mobile the first and only nationwide Internet provider for business. And third, we saw another opportunity to help customers as travel is on the rebound. But like everything else, travel has become more expensive and more complicated. So T-Mobile launched Coverage Beyond to help people get back out there and save money while doing it. We have got customers covered across the U.S., on their airline flights, on the road and in more than 210 countries and destinations. This is what the Un-carrier is all about, chasing down customer pain points and smashing them, and right now, with this economy, there are a lot of pain points out there. And you know what? This strategy works again and again. We delivered another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth. In fact, we posted a record 380,000 postpaid account net adds. The highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I have said before, this measure of total billing relationships is a strong barometer that we are winning the switching decisions in this industry. I know the competitive market trends are top of mind and here\u2019s what we saw in Q2. Postpaid switching activity increased year-over-year and we benefited from more than our fair share of those switching decisions. Importantly, our network and brand are consistently attracting the industry\u2019s best customers, driving the prime mix of our customer base to an all-time high. And we delivered our highest ever Q2 postpaid net additions with an industry best 1.7 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined again. This includes 723,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped 13 basis points sequentially to 0.80 and we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. In fact, delivering lower churn than Verizon for the first time ever on a combined basis including Sprint. The fact that our all-in churn, including Sprint, is trending so strongly just two years out from our merger shows our team\u2019s fantastic progress and it is exactly what we told you would happen. Okay, let\u2019s talk about high-speed Internet, where our team delivered 560,000 net additions. I am pretty confident that we will see T-Mobile as the fastest growing broadband provider in the industry for the third consecutive quarter and most likely by a wide margin. Demand continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. I am so excited to see our broadband business hit this pace, which puts us right on track to meet the multiyear ambitions we shared with you last year. We continue to see great customer adoption of Magenta MAX, which is helping drive our strong ARPU and ARPA trends. With the trends we are seeing, we now expect postpaid ARPA to be up roughly 3% in 2022. These results reflect our differentiated strategy to unlock growth across smaller markets and rural areas, T-Mobile for Business, network seekers in the top 100 markets who hadn\u2019t previously considered us and in new product categories like 5G broadband. They also reflect the strength of our network leadership, as supported by nearly every third party. Recent reports from Ookla and PC Magazine not only recognize T-Mobile for the fastest and most available 5G network, but for the best overall network experience. And OpenSignal recently reported that not only did our average speeds increase yet again, the gap over the competition widened even further despite their C-band deployments. We are winning this race, and as I have been telling you, we plan to stay ahead. And speaking of network, we just hit some major integration milestones. Just over two years since we closed the merger, we have successfully shutdown most of the Sprint network. As of the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively decommissioned nearly two-thirds of the 35,000 targeted sites and can now report that we will be substantially complete by the end of Q3 this current quarter, remarkable work by the team to deliver these milestones ahead even of our recent year-end target and more than one year earlier than our original merger plan. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on cybersecurity, following the criminal attack we experienced roughly a year ago. Protecting our customers\u2019 data is a top priority for the company, which is why following the attack we immediately took additional steps to protect our customers. We created a cyber transformation office and engaged some of the top -- world\u2019s top experts to help. We are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance our data security tools and capabilities to transform our cybersecurity program. We always knew that there would unfortunately be financial consequences from this attack and we were pleased to recently reach settlements that will resolve the class actions and most of the consumer claims. Together, we believe these settlements will represent the biggest component of those impacts. These costs were contemplated in our financial guidance and the amounts are consistent with precedents we have seen in other similar agreements. We are now focused on moving forward as we continue to invest in and enhance our company\u2019s cybersecurity. Okay, let me give a quick recap before I hand things over to Peter. I am very pleased with our company\u2019s performance and progress against our ambitious multiyear goals. Again, this quarter, we outperformed against our plans, and again, led the industry in net additions of postpaid customers and growth in postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows, and as a result, we raised our guidance across the board again. The Un-carrier value proposition resonates, and it\u2019s so well tuned to the tax. People want the best network and now more than ever they wanted at the best value from a team that\u2019s obsessed with their satisfaction. Our strategy is so simple, but maybe that\u2019s why it works quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights from Q2 and our increased guidance for 2022 in more detail.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered another strong quarter with our Q2 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% for the second quarter in a row. This just highlights our profitable growth strategy when compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA margins that you see from others in our industry. That growth in profitability fueled higher operating cash flow and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow, while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. And finally, I wanted to highlight a few special items that impacted earnings for the quarter. As we foreshadowed last quarter with the shutdown of the Sprint network, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business. As a result, we took a non-cash impairment charge of $477 million on a pretax basis in Q2. In addition, we recorded a $400 million pretax charge related to the $350 million class action settlement and other expenses from the data breach one year ago, which was within our guidance expectations for the year. All right, let\u2019s jump into the details of our increased guidance across the Board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6 million and 6.3 million, up 600,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on reducing sprint churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds will be coming from phones for the full year. As we mentioned last quarter, the net adds guidance does not include the subset of customers who we do not expect to migrate upon our network sunsets, which were treated as a base adjustment. As we began the orderly network shutdowns at the end of Q2, we took an adjustment of 284,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 946,000 postpaid other devices that were not practical to be upgraded. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and merger synergies. This excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, up $200 million at the midpoint as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA and are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. With Q2 being the peak quarter, we expect that Q3 will be closer to Q1 levels, and then taper off in Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities including payments for merger-related costs are now expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, which is up $250 million at the midpoint with both the robust pace of our 5G deployment and our success in high-speed Internet, where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion, which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we successfully executed our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 3%. And we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. Before I wrap up, I want to celebrate an important milestone of achieving an investment grade corporate family rating for the first time in our company\u2019s history. With the Moody\u2019s upgrade last week, in addition to our existing investment-grade rating from Fitch, T-Mobile now has investment grade ratings from two of the three top ratings agencies. This is proof of the investment community\u2019s confidence in our Un-carrier playbook, delivering on our substantial -- delivering on our accelerated merger integration and synergies, executing on our differentiated growth strategy and our ability to translate that into unprecedented free cash flow. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.\nJud Henry: Thanks, Peter. Let\u2019s get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: We will go first to David Barden with Bank of America.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guy. Thanks so much for taking the\u2026\nMike Sievert: Hi, David.\nDavid Barden: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So, obviously, Peter, congratulations on the IG rating. Obviously, everyone\u2019s going to want to know how that informs your plans to begin executing on the stock buyback program and kind of your maybe updated thoughts around that in light of the recent actions? And I guess, second, if I could, just on the guidance increase in core adjusted EBITDA of $150 million. With the merger synergies now going up to $200 million, 2Q results kind of being, I think, ahead of where street expectations were and in light of the new wholesale agreement that you struck with DISH, which likely means that the kind of pressure on the wholesale business is not going to be nearly as much as was feared. I guess, it sounds to me like that $150 million could be larger and if you could talk a little bit about maybe some of the reasons why it might not be larger given some of the inflation and the other pressures in the market? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: I will start with the first and then, like, get Peter wound up to answer the second one. First of all, I just want to congratulate this whole team and our finance department and Peter, first and foremost, for achieving this major milestone. We have sought to be an investment-grade issuer for many years. It\u2019s been a goal of ours and now we have two of the three rating agencies. I certainly hope to see S&P soon. And that\u2019s just an exciting moment for us and particularly with what has happened this year in the high yield market, it\u2019s particularly important. As we have said all along about the share buybacks, there was no preset designated things that needed to be accomplished before our Board would deliberate on this. But with where high yield markets are right now, clearly, this is a very important milestone. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have an update for you other than to reiterate what we told you in the past, looking at all of our momentum, our financial performance, we continue to see upwards of $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 in total with the possibility of beginning sooner, and absolutely, nothing has changed on that front, but we have accomplished some very important milestones toward that end.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. All right, Dave. And on your other question of core adjusted EBITDA and what are we seeing from inflation, what are we seeing from DISH and with synergies up $200 million and core adjusted EBITDA of $150 million, what are some of the delta items in there. So, first, just with regards to DISH, I think we are very pleased to have reached agreement, gone through all of the settlements of the disputes, as well as the CDMA shutdown and we are looking forward to being great partners with DISH in the future. The agreement, as of the struck, gives us tremendous visibility into what revenues will be in the coming years. And while that\u2019s down over Analyst Day expectations, it\u2019s about three quarters of what we anticipated at Analyst Day through the duration of the plan period, so very pleased with that. The other thing I will say from an inflation perspective, as we have talked before, there\u2019s been a great, great work by Neville and his team to early on lock in a lot of our significant cost into long-term contracts, whether that was on the CapEx side, with the OEM vendors as the network rollout happened, whether it was with tower operators, whether that was with backhaul. So we have been able to get a lot of those costs fixed. Of course, we are seeing some pressure, as everybody else is, particularly in the labor space, but that\u2019s all contemplated into the guide itself. Synergy is up $200 million is just, again, speaks to Neville and his team and how quickly they are moving on decommissioning in a very efficient and customer-friendly manner. And the other thing I will point to is, we just raised net adds guidance by 600,000 at the midpoint. So, obviously, the S part of SG&A will be the thing that we are investing in to drive that growth, as well as that quicker acceleration of the network allows Neville to continue building quicker and you have some earlier costs associated with that, which of course, pays off in the ability to acquire customers with this value prop. So those are all the components as I think about them.\nMike Sievert: David, that last point is particularly important to me. As you have seen something from this report, you have seen that we have incredible momentum right now on growth. I mean more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined, plus or including 560,000, by and large, high-speed Internet connections and those things cost us money to generate that growth in an in-period basis. So we are anticipating, as you saw in the guide, continued success there. Also, our accounting approach, as Peter has explained in the past, is a little different than our competitors. We take the preponderance of those costs in period rather than racking up millions of dollars on our balance sheet that would come in the form of negative revenue charges later. So those are some of the key things that explain the difference between the increase in synergies and the increase in EBITDA.\nDavid Barden: Super helpful guys. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Let\u2019s come back to the phones.\nOperator: We will go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Good morning. Thank you. A couple on fixed wireless, if I could. First, if you could just update us. I think, you talked about account growth being driven by fixed wireless. Can you just talk about new to T-Mobile, what\u2019s that doing in terms of pulling through phone adds and into reducing churn, what sort of impact you are seeing as this becomes a more important part every month of the base? And then, I guess, a question for Neville and a way you are at 560 this quarter, annualizing at over $2 million. It seems like it\u2019s accelerating on a steady basis. If you extrapolate that out, that takes you pretty much to the top end of that $7 million to $8 million by 2025. It looks like you could exceed it. What\u2019s your capability in terms of network capacity to handle the 5 -- more than, say, 500,000, 600,000 adds per quarter or is this going to be sort of the run rate to take us to that guidance by 2025? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Great. Well, I will jump in first and then turn it to Neville. I am so delighted with what\u2019s happening here. I mean 560,000 net adds is a run rate that, if you just do the math, it gets us to the goals that we have established. And so this is really now a run rate business that we are very excited to be seeing success around. And not a lot has changed in that it remains the case that the majority of our net additions are coming from existing T-Mobile customers. And that\u2019s terrific to see and we not only like that trend, but we doubled down on it with offers during the quarter. As you saw, Internet Freedom put in an exciting offer for Magenta MAX customers to create a bundle and we have seen the uptake of that has been really terrific. So, for example, loading of the new high-speed Internet product late in the quarter and early in this quarter has been coming in a little above $45, as compared to $49 to $50 in the base. So you see that you are getting the benefit of that bundle blended in now and most of the sales continue to be to our existing customers. That being said, it also is a terrific front door for the company and you can see that it\u2019s driving new relationships. But increasingly, those new relationships are not just stopping at high speed Internet. So they are coming in buying high speed Internet and then going ahead and switching, including Magenta MAX. So that\u2019s starting to work as a very successful cycle. Anything to add to that, Mike or Jon?\nMike Katz: The only other thing I would add is we are also seeing more and more customers pick both at the point of sale. I think a dynamic that\u2019s been driven by exactly what you just said, Mike, this powerful bundling that we have done with Magenta MAX. And we continue to see growth coming from the two areas that Mike said upfront, about two-thirds coming from suburban and urban environments, where they are switching from cable, and one-third coming from rural, where we are the only high speed alternative and that\u2019s been an exciting area and pocket of growth that we will continue to expand as the network expands. A little over half were switching from cable and here\u2019s an interesting thing that came out in the Ookla study this past month. It -- and this is based on comprehensive -- it\u2019s Ookla comprehensive speed test. And for the first time, T-Mobile 5G surpassed the nationwide speeds of cable providers, looking at Comcast and Charter on cable connections as compared to T-Mobile customers on 5G smartphones, the T-Mobile customer 5G speed test nationwide median were higher and that really shows you one more data point on the competitiveness of our ability to use this network to serve high speed Internet customers. Okay, second question.\nNeville Ray: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Simon. You have opened the door for me to talk about 5G network, lots to talk about.\nMike Sievert: That\u2019s all the time we have.\nNeville Ray: Quote-unquote, I will be brief. The in-home broadband story, it\u2019s just a tremendous testament to the progress we have made with rolling out at a really accelerated pace to our 5G network. I mean, we clearly have a very strong leadership position on 5G. It\u2019s significant. It\u2019s durable. We are here to lead on this 5G story for years to come. And so we announced in the materials today our low-band network, now 320 million people covered, 97% of all Americans. Our mid-band footprint, our ultra-capacity 5G, which is where the 5G story really comes to life, 235 million people covered well on our way to 260 million by the end of this year and that footprint covers 87% of T-Mobile customers today. So a tremendous progress, we are actually hitting some of the highest production rates in our two year history rolling out mid-band, well over 1,000 sites moved into various radio upgrades on a weekly basis inside the month of July, so real momentum across the Board. And what we can do on in-home broadband, to your question, Simon, is a real product. This in-home product is in-home broadband product is a testament to our 5G network growth. And as Mike referenced, our Ookla report, if you look at the fixed broadband industry and the median speeds, it\u2019s lower than what T-Mobile is being recorded as delivering on a median speed basis. And so it\u2019s not just about footprint, it\u2019s about capacity and the spectrum story and today we have over 110 megahertz of dedicated mid-band spectrum on average across that mid-band footprint and over 30 megahertz of extended range 5G spectrum. So 140 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum and it\u2019s that capability of coverage, plus 5G depth and spectrum that allows us to push into these 5G broadband stories and this growth. And we are really, I mean, we are a year into this business, Simon. We are very confident about the projections and capabilities that we have mapped out over the coming years. But this network is really starting to now gain traction. The integration with Sprint is all over by the shelving, to be honest, two-thirds of the sites have been de-commed, less than 1% of the Sprint traffic -- customer traffic now on that legacy Sprint network, high confidence. We will bring that to a close as we exit this quarter. And that\u2019s driving a ton of goodness. The spectrum that we can migrate and move across, the coverage and the capabilities that come with one very strong powerhouse network and a little over two years from when we started this process. So great progress, very confident in what we are delivering, delighted with the speeds that we are delivering on in-home broadband and I think we are bringing to the market probably the real first 5G use case. Everybody has been hunting for this thing. But in-home broadband, fixed wireless is here and it\u2019s here to stay.\nMike Sievert: Simon, one of the things that Neville said, I think, has been under discussed, which is how much spectrum we have against this leading mid-band 5G footprint. There\u2019s a lot of discussion about fact that we have 235 million people covered with mid-band ultra capacity 5G as compared to 70 for AT&T, 135 for Verizon, as they begin their C-band deployments. But what\u2019s really interesting is what Neville said about the depths of spectrum across that 235 on average. He said 110 megahertz of mid-band, plus 30 of low band, 140 dedicated to that 5G layer, and that\u2019s unique and it will be unique for some time to come. And it really allows for the kinds of capacity throughput and performance that we have been talking about on this call. It opens up not just high speed Internet opportunities but really exciting opportunities in the business space that our competitors can issue press releases around, but where we are ready to execute and support businesses right now with advanced network 5G services. So we will talk more about that later. But thanks for your question about that.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Next caller.\nOperator: We will go next to John Hodulik with UBS.\nMike Sievert: Hey, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two issues or two areas I\u2019d like to explore. First, on the macro side, Mike, you said the consumer is feeling some pressure. I mean any impact so far in terms of slower payment or on bad debt? And are you seeing any evidence that your value proposition is actually driving some flow share versus your competitors? That\u2019s number one. And then I thought the highlight of the quarter was the phone churn 80 bps. Any color you can give in terms of the disaggregating, what you are seeing on the Magenta side or on the Sprint side, and how close are we to getting that Sprint churn down to where we are with Magenta and further improvement in that metric? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yeah. Absolutely, John. Well, first, let me just take the first question on what we are seeing. You saw that our bad debt returned to more historic levels this quarter and we are very comfortable with it at this level. One of the things that makes us different than our competitors in this space is we have a long history and a deep confidence at dealing with customers who have variable economic circumstances. And so it\u2019s not new for us that some customers are stressed up financially. We know how to work with them on that front and you have seen our bad debt levels return to more historic rates. There have been other things driving that debt as well. One of the things you see is that our EIT balances continue to rise. And in EIT balances, when those go bad, it hits that bad debt metric as opposed to leasing, which we have been rapidly moving customers off does not. So there\u2019s an artifact there. There\u2019s also some accounting artifacts that cause us to be more forward looking in our bad debt charges now than before, plus the return to more historic norms. Long way of saying, we are very comfortable with where it is and we know how to execute in this environment. But to your point, it\u2019s very interesting. There is a flight to value that I believe is beginning to happen. You see it in our suppressed churn rates as people are comfortable where they are, our progress across both T-Mobile and Sprint to the premise of your question, our net add performance, our overall account growth performance was the highest ever in our history for any quarter in any season was this quarter, 380,000 new account additions. And so there is a flight to value that is beginning to happen and T-Mobile is famous for value in our category. At a time when this product category is becoming more and more indispensable, we are famous for value while showing you that we are second to none on the quality of the product and so that\u2019s something that I think positions us very, very well for the times. On that 0.80, look, I am just so proud of the team. We told you two years ago that we would execute our worst to first playbook and a lot of people looked at us and said, yeah, but you have got Sprint now. And here we are with 0.80 in combined churn and possibly some room to run. We will see where we go. There\u2019s obviously offsetting pressures here on the involve side that all of the carriers are seeing. But we look at Q3 and it looks to us like we will be 2021 churn by a similar margin in Q3 as we beat it in Q2, mid-to-high single-digit bps improvement versus last year, and of course, there\u2019s seasonal effects in the second half of the year as switching tends to be higher due to phone launches. So we are very comfortable with what we are seeing and we believe that as we continue to get more and more Sprint customers settled with the right rate plans, which is the last component of our integration that potentially there\u2019s some more momentum to see in the quarters ahead. Anything to add to that, Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: No. I think you hit it all really well.\nMike Sievert: Okay.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, Mike.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, John. Okay, Operator?\nOperator: Yeah. We will go next to Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Yeah. Hi, guys. It seem we have been hitting with everybody sort of I wonder if you could reflect on the new revenue opportunities aside from fixed wireless that come from 5G, whether it\u2019s mobile edge compute, private networks, IoT? And talk about how your thinking has evolved about the size of those revenue opportunities and how it is that you think T-Mobile can most effectively compete to get what\u2019s there?\nMike Sievert: You bet, Craig. Let me first start by saying, we are a lot further along in this space and in thinking around it and execution around it, then you would probably surmise from our press releases. And I will have Kelly talk about some of what\u2019s going on out there. But we are hesitant to take an early business like this and forecast it forward for you when it\u2019s in its infancy. Our competitors haven\u2019t had much choice about that, and so they have gone ahead and given some big aspirations in this area. But our view is it\u2019s an emerging market and we can achieve what we set out to achieve, generally speaking, in the core business. But that being said, there are exciting things happening, and what\u2019s interesting is this 5G network leadership is getting us conversations with CIOs, CEOs, the coroner office that our company never earned before. We were talking about smartphone plans with the procurement office two years ago and that\u2019s the big difference. And Callie, maybe you can share a little bit of what you are seeing and the kinds of conversations you and your team are having.\nCallie Field: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So it\u2019s been an exciting time to spend time with CIOs and CTOs as they are looking at their own digital transformation. They are looking at their own ways to manage costs, be efficient and effective, and get connectivity that is on not only the largest and fastest, most reliable 5G network, but the only provider that has a 5G standalone port, which CIOs understand that matters to solutions like Advanced Network Services. We talked about how we launched Business Internet as a part of our Internet Freedom Un-carrier move this past quarter. But for business, this was significant because we are the only provider that truly has nationwide 5G Internet for businesses, which allows us a really great frontdoor to sit down and talk about, yes, we can connect your retail locations, working with places like Tractor Supply and Circle K and AutoZone, but we also are sitting down and talking about, hey, how can we use edge compute solutions and IoT connectivity in order to really help you solve the business problems that you are facing as leaders. We also launched or announced our relationship, our new customer, Cell GP. You don\u2019t know Cell GP, that\u2019s the world\u2019s most extreme sailing competition and we saw in the last rate 240,000 data points transferred from 6,400 sensors, and we were able to deliver up to a 50% reduction in latency. That gives athletes a competitive advantage and fans of really in view of the race, so broadcasting retail. We are also doing a lot of work with this advanced network solutions in the automotive industry. And because of our relationship with DT and our TIoT platform that we launched and told you about last quarter, we are able to provide seamless global connectivity for their B2B2C solutions, as well as for employees who are traveling internationally as a part of our last and most recent Un-carrier moves. So we have seen a lot of action. And we don\u2019t want to discount full line here. I mean we like to have the phone lines and we are seeing the lowest levels of business phone churn in our history and I think we just heard that Verizon reported some of their highest. And so we are growing in business. We are growing in enterprise in SMB and in the public sector as well and we are very interested in where we are headed with these Advanced Network Solutions.\nMike Sievert: I am glad you mentioned coverage beyond and all that, too, because not only are there incredible opportunities for us to do deep services for enterprises as they look to create network-as-a-service and outsource some of that thinking to advanced networks like ours, but we are still interested in the core. And coverage beyond was an investment in something that originally put map with enterprises in the first place. Our simple global move in 2013 was our introduction to enterprise. And today, we have launched coverage beyond, which not just doubles down, it multiplies the power of that move by many times so that now business customers and consumers can travel the world and have high speed data, the highest on offer in that country completely included in our most popular plan, not low speed data and it is a breakthrough. So we are very excited about what that portends for our business customers and consumers. Neville, I will give you the last word on this question.\nNeville Ray: Yeah. I mean, I think, we -- I\u2019d say this, Craig. We are the best positioned company in the U.S. for all of 5G opportunities that Callie outlined. There\u2019s just no doubt. I mean, this 5G thing is for real at T-Mobile. I mean more than 50% of our entire network traffic is now on 5G, over 55%, actually and that number continues to increase as we see great engagement and great discussions with all manner of opportunities, business leaders, as well as our consumer base. And we continue to really push the 5G architecture. We are the only company, as Callie referenced, with a standalone network core. We are the only company in the U.S. to push -- to move voice services, voice over a new radio onto that 5G layer. Why is that important? Because as a company, we are a 5G business, we are not in the business yet of retiring LTE, but we are focused on that at some point in time in the coming years. This 5G network is moving at incredible pace, coverage, spectrum and architecture. And we have a lead on all corners of that dialogue against our competition, which positions us incredibly well for future growth across all segments. So delighted with our progress and the 5G story is not just beginning. I mean, we are into it at T-Mobile and the growth vectors are starting to shape up around us incredibly well.\nMike Sievert: Beautiful. Okay. And before we go back to the phones, I know we have some coming in on Twitter. I see a few upfront. Janice, did you find some what we should be tackling here?\nJanice Kapner: Yeah. We have a couple. Let\u2019s start with Bill Ho. He\u2019s asking for some notable examples of enterprise or medium company wins from T-Mobile for Business. I know Callie may have some good things to talk about there. And to your point earlier on our coverage announcement, curious how that\u2019s impacting the business broadly both consumer and B2B?\nMike Sievert: Anything to double down, I know you just kind of answered some of that.\nCallie Field: Right. I mean, we had did some great work with AutoZone and General Mills, we spoke, we did an interesting solution using ANS and edge compute and some smart warehousing, where we built a combination private network and public network. We have been working with a lot of global automakers using both our TIoT capabilities, as well as edge solution for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. And then another cool thing in SMB, because we are seeing a lot of growth in SMB as well, we just announced -- we partnered with Apple to launch the only wireless plan that includes Apple Business Essentials, which is really cool for small businesses to really where they are looking at cost, when they are looking at getting more efficient and effective, how they can manage all of their devices at once with an incredible rate plan and an iPhone 13 included. So that was a really big announcement recently.\nMike Sievert: So lots of exciting new logos, only some of which we say because of agreements with customers. But the other thing that\u2019s happening that\u2019s really interesting is that we are deepening relationships with enterprise customers across the board. Remember, a couple of years ago, we were kind of winning some accounts along the lines of, hey, if I throw you a few of my lines kind of unofficially, will you help me re-price my AT&T business, and you will get some of my. That\u2019s never really spoken, but you can see the RFPs were sort of designed for that. And what happens now is some years later, customers are coming back and saying, actually, I\u2019d like you to bid for the whole kit and caboodle now. And so this potential to deepen with customers is really happening and that\u2019s a dynamic that\u2019s driving our sales. So, hopefully, Roger and Bill that answer some of your questions about TFP. So, Jess, get ready for the next one. I will go back to the phone while we do that. So, Operator?\nOperator: Yeah. We will go next to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Two follow-ups on prior questions actually. So, Neville, I\u2019d love to just the context you gave around fixed wireless broadband and the capability for the network was great. But I am wondering if you can address what you think you can serve in terms of capacity, the capacity that you have got in terms of the total number of subs you could put on the network. I know you said in the past that 7 million to 8 million that you expect in 2025 isn\u2019t the limit. So I would love to know what the limit is. And then just to stick with the theme on enterprise for a second. I am wondering if you guys could give us a sense of how you are progressing towards that 20% share where you are at this point. And Mike, you said that you -- it\u2019s too soon to put a market sizing on the mobile edge compute and private network opportunity. Does that mean that none of that opportunity is in your long-term plan? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Great. Let me start with Peter to talk about the last two questions about the plan and the 20% share, et cetera, and then we will give it back to your earlier questions, Jon.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Jonathan, as you know, all of the -- because of all the reasons that Mike just described around an emerging business, while we are best positioned to capture it, it wasn\u2019t something that we built into the plan when we did Analyst Day targets, because it was too early. We didn\u2019t want to make the plan with something that we didn\u2019t have a good view and a road map to how to get the growth, but we are seeing the capitalization of that. So that is all upside, potential upside to the plan, very excited about that. In terms of progression in enterprise space, you heard Callie say we are actually, what\u2019s exciting about this is, we see growth across the entire T-Mobile for business segment. It\u2019s not just enterprise, it\u2019s government, it\u2019s SMB. So we are excited about the progression in all of those categories against our goals.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. And then how many millions and millions of customers can we support? We are not really going to be able to answer that because we don\u2019t halt?\nMike Sievert: It kind of depends. One of the things that we have disclosed in the past that our model, which is an excess capacity model is based on our anticipated share gains in mobile. And the usage of our base in mobile, which we expect to continue to rise at a rapid pace arriving in this planning period at around 80 gigs per mobile customer. And maybe that will be higher, maybe that will be lower and that\u2019s obviously a very important input to this. And obviously, so is the availability of spectrum, our ability to refarm spectrum, to deploy it, et cetera. But I don\u2019t know, do you want to take a stab at answering this question or are we just going to say we don\u2019t know, Neville?\nNeville Ray: Well, I am not sure that we want to announce revised numbers today. So, I mean, Jonathan, you know our story well. You know the $7 million to $8 million that we put out into the marketplace some time back. But to Mike\u2019s comments just now, if you look at where we are, we are ahead on our coverage rollout on 5G, we are ahead on our spectrum transition, we are ahead on our integration goals that we established when we put that plan together. There are many factors coming in, but we see great consumer adoption on the 5G side and our capacity generation for this business is ahead of schedule. We always said that, if you compare where this business would be as a combined T-Mobile and Sprint in 2024, 2025 against the standalone T-Mobile, that multiple was about a 14x, 1-4 on capacity. We are about halfway through that already in terms of the capacity we are generating. So we are in the business of creating a lot of headroom for growth for the company. And can we bend that curve some more? I am sure we can, but we are still early into this business. As we said, we are a year in driving great numbers, and we will see, I think, as we exit this year with continued strong growth in the space, we will be in a position to look forward into 2023 and 2024 with great momentum and hopefully some stronger numbers.\nMike Sievert: We have been an early adopter of so many techniques and technologies that have allowed us to unlock capabilities for our customers in the network space. And Neville and Ulf and Doel and their teams are constantly chasing new ideas and capacity is one of the centerpieces of our conversations now because of the premise of your question. So it\u2019s a topic we are very interested in. I will tell you that we won\u2019t load customers beyond where we can give them a great experience. And right now, our Net Promoter Scores continue to rise. They are 30 points higher than the competition. They are triple what they are from a provider that our customers are switching from. We just won a major nationwide survey of all ISPs that are scaled, named us the second highest in customer satisfaction in the country and number one was a fiber provider. And so our customers love this product and it\u2019s really important for us and for our brand that we continue to load customers where we know we can serve them well. And but, hopefully, that gives you some color on where we stand.\nJonathan Chaplin: Fair enough. Thanks guys.\nMike Sievert: You bet. We want to go on to Twitter for another one.\nJanice Kapner: Sure. This is a great question from Roger about churn. You are growing significantly with often free connected devices. How are you going to prevent to have the same to your churn off experience that the others are having -- have experienced when they drove connected device net adds, kind of ties to Alan\u2019s question about churn from some of the smaller players as well.\nMike Sievert: Yeah. Maybe we start with Mike on this one. I will say, what\u2019s going on in the market is very different from what you saw from our competitors some years ago. There aren\u2019t, by and large, we are not, by and large, driving this through free devices or free connections. What\u2019s happening is we live in a 5G world now and people are getting real utility and value out of tablets, watches and other devices, because of the strength of our network and because of the changing lifestyles of connected lives. But, Mike, maybe you can give a little more on what we are seeing.\nMike Katz: Yeah. Hey. Roger, thanks for the question. I do think in a world where people only differentiate off of giving free phones, the risk that you point out is a real one. And in our model, we recognize that a lot of the competition has moved to free devices and we feel like we have done a really good job figuring out how to deliver on free devices but not make that our big point of differentiation. Our big point of differentiation is what you have heard from several of us today, it\u2019s this value proposition that gives customers the best value without having to make any trade-offs on network and that proposition, I think, is more important now than it ever has been before, because with the macroeconomic environment, customers are looking for ways to save money and not have to make trade-offs and experience and really only T-Mobile is the one that provides that. Right now, T-Mobile customers, T-Mobile families can save $225 on T-Mobile, not just through their core wireless services, but with all the value that we pack into a plan like Magenta MAX and the included benefits that we give in things like streaming services and everything else. So I think what you are seeing is and what you will continue to see is customers picking us because we have the best overall value position, because we can save them in expenses across their entire lives and that\u2019s translating into things like you saw this quarter with sequential and big year-over-year churn decreases. And as it relates to connected devices, we are also watching usage and it\u2019s very important that those devices are actively used and paid for and they are. And so that\u2019s something that\u2019s very important so we don\u2019t get question. Okay. Let\u2019s go back to the phones.\nOperator: We will go next to Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: Yeah, guys. Thanks. Mike, you said that the prime mix is at an all-time high. What is the mix of the base, as well as in first incoming accounts or if you can give us something sort of relative? And then you talked about bad debt, and we noticed that DSO stretched out a couple of days. What changes have you seen lately in customer activity, anything you can tell us around traffic levels, lower payments or traffic and increased charge-offs? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Sounds good, Phil. So, well, let\u2019s go to Peter Osvaldik to say what we are seeing.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Definitely. We are not giving the prime mix of the base. Obviously, very recent, but it is up significantly. In terms of what we are seeing from a payment pattern perspective, on a year-over-year basis involve churn is up, and remember, last year was tremendously muted. There was still a lot of stimulus money. There was still not really the switching activity happening. So we are seeing what we anticipated is that you would see an increase involve churn still below pre-pandemic levels for us. And we talked about bad debt a little bit, and of course, what we did in Q2 as well is, remember, the accounting standard changed a couple of years ago and now forces us rightfully so to look forward as well. And so we did a macroeconomic loss overlay in Q2 that was significant, whereas last year, that wasn\u2019t happening. In fact, we had some releases happen as we saw involve churn way down. So I do believe Q2, of course, we are watching the macroeconomic trends very carefully and customer payment patterns and behavior, but I believe Q2, based on everything we are seeing now, was the high watermark in terms of bad debt expense for us in 2022. Again, it goes back to that tremendous core competency that we have that we actually built on even further when we saw some of the FCC holds happen, we created even further differentiated tools to help our customers and we are seeing that pay off in dividends now.\nMike Sievert: And like I said in my opening remarks, we are comfortable here and increasing our EBITDA, feel confident with how we are handling the macroeconomic picture. There are places in our P&L where there are pressure points, but there\u2019s also a lot of opportunity for us to stand up and serve customers at a time when they need a company to provide them with a fantastic value. Great. Let\u2019s go back to the phone.\nOperator: We will go next to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And I have sort of two follow-ups. So you talked about migrating Sprint customers to the right rate plans. I was hoping you can maybe just give us an update, where are you in terms of migrating the legacy Sprint subs fully over to T-Mobile, when do you think that will be done and are you continuing to see the churn improvement in that cohort as that unfolds? And then the second question is, you seem comfortable with this kind of 500,000 or so fixed wireless net add quarterly run rate. What\u2019s going to be the driver of that, particularly as we think out the next few quarters? I am specifically interested in the extent to which you may be expanding distribution. I think it\u2019s available to over 40 million potential customers today. I don\u2019t know where that might go. And what are you seeing or what are you expecting in terms of fixed wireless churn? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Where do we want to start? Maybe turn to Mike on the first one.\nMike Katz: Yeah.\nPeter Osvaldik: Mike, I can speak to that one maybe and Mike would do fixed wireless. In terms of migration of rate plans, you saw certainly in the first part of last year, as we said, we did a significant amount of the rate plan migrations to the target rate plans. There\u2019s still some more of that to go in planned, both this year as well as the start of next year, but we are through the vast majority of it. I think inferred in the question was also, when are we going through the billing migration, which we always said, was going to be disconnected from the network migration to make it a seamless to the customer as we can and that plan goes through middle of next year as we build the capabilities on and then really seamlessly convert customers, which has already begun. We are already in the process of doing that. But to make that, again, is churn friendly and as consumer-friendly as possible, that\u2019s going to go through mid-next year. And so maybe I can...\nMike Sievert: Yeah. Yeah. Just on the -- it\u2019s harder to answer. You saw we didn\u2019t disclose sort of a Sprint migration figure this time only because it\u2019s becoming harder and harder to do so. As Neville said in his remarks, less than 1% of the traffic is now on the legacy Sprint network. We will be at network shutdown this quarter, having decommissioned substantially all of the sites. And so now it becomes much more of a picture of, do they have the right rate plan, do they have the right device plan, are we -- have we reengaged with them and gotten the recommitment from them, et cetera? That\u2019s a stepwise process. But you can see the incredible progress that we are making with combined churn being at 0.80. And then, as it relates to fixed wireless, first of all, what I said in my remarks was that we have achieved now a pace that if you were to extrapolate it forward gets us to our goals. That wasn\u2019t a forecast for you though. That wasn\u2019t a prediction that it will be at that pace it could be higher, it could be lower, this is an emerging business, it\u2019s going really well. And what\u2019s interesting is I don\u2019t think we have yet fully tapped our base with this potential. I don\u2019t think we have yet fully have the opportunity of prepaid with this potential, which has been newer in distribution. Jon and team have done a fantastic job bringing this to metro. TFB still represents a minority of our connections and yet we are the only one with our most recent Un-carrier move to provide a nationwide broadband service to businesses. The sales cycles there are longer. And it\u2019s a good thing that we have lots of potential tailwinds here because, obviously, as the base grows, we know that math is math and churn will grow and that\u2019s just obvious. And so we have to outrun that and then some. And we are very confident and feeling like we are in a great spot. Anything both Mike and Jon to add to what we are seeing how distribution is going, the value proposition?\nMike Katz: Yeah. Maybe I will sit churn, and then Jon can talk about distribution. I think it\u2019s too early. We launched this business one year ago. So it\u2019s too early to make like big broad comments about churn. The thing that I will point to that we have said in some of our earliest comments is, NPS on this product is amongst the best and broadband providers only vested by one fiber provider by a single point. And then the performance that customers are getting is they are not making any trade-offs and I think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s really resonating with customers is a great price that\u2019s reliable and predictable and not making a trade-off on their incumbent service. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s resonating with customers and that will be a big part of our strategy, is making more customers aware of that going forward. I don\u2019t know, Jon, if you want to talk about distribution?\nJon Freier: Yeah. The only thing I would say is that we are still ramping in distribution. We have got this product across all of our T-Mobile stores. We have got it service from a digital point of view. Our telesales teams, et cetera. And then just most recently in the previous quarter, we announced this and launched this in Metro by T-Mobile. So we are still driving that and ramping it, like Mike said, we have got quite a bit of opportunity here still. When you think about an underserved segment like our prepaid customers with high speed Internet, so many of these customers don\u2019t even have a product, they can\u2019t get it. They can\u2019t afford it except from your typical mainstream cable provider. And what you can get with this particular product at the price point with the all-in total cost of ownership is just incredible. So we continue to see that we have more runway here. We are continuing to build that and we might have even more distribution opportunities with other partners in the future as well.\nMike Sievert: And Operator, we can probably squeeze in one last question.\nOperator: We will go next to Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Thanks. Hi. Two questions, if I could. First, just going back to the volume side of the equation, as you consider the updated postpaid net add and postpaid phone outlook, what are the expectations for the industry growth for the rest of the year and are there any notable changes in the landscape early in the third quarter? And then, separately, just maybe taking a step back, I was curious if you could give us an update on the possibility to monetize the Sprint wireline assets and if there are other considerations for T-Mobile to consider the use of M&A to accelerate the core strategy for the company? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. On volume, our forecasts don\u2019t imply an industry run rate. Our job is to win switching decisions and you saw in our quarter, that\u2019s exactly what we did. And so we are not deeply dependent on industry net adds. That being said, what we are seeing is overall switching is up about 3% in the marketplace. We have not seen any substantial changes to that as we have entered into the new quarter or any other substantial changes to the overall competitive dynamics since the quarter ended. So that\u2019s what we are seeing across the Board. As it relates to Sprint wireline asset, you may have seen we made some announcements that we are no longer using that asset to support our wireless business. We are obviously conducting a review as to the best way to manage that asset. It\u2019s a terrific product with a deep, deep legacy in our company and it\u2019s important that we make the right decisions there for the long haul, taking into account how the market has changed over time. M&A, listen, you never rule that out. You never rule that out. That being said, one of the things I hope you are getting from this call is that we are very, very confident as a management team in our ability to execute with the hand we are holding. In a broad market where all content and communications have left their linear forms and have landed on the Internet, and the Internet is going mobile, we are this nation\u2019s leading pure-play mobile Internet company and we are executing very solidly for our shareholders with a clear eye towards returning value to those shareholders as a result of our efforts. And so we are very pleased with where we sit, but smart management teams never rule out ways to further benefit our position for shareholders. And that\u2019s a great place to leave it. Listen, I hope you got from this call, our confidence. We are having a lot of fun here. We are taking care of our customers. We are leading this company into a new era of the Un-carrier, and quarter-after-quarter where our aspiration is to continue to post results that increase your confidence in us as a management team. Thanks for tuning in today, everybody. Appreciate it.\nJud Henry: And we can close the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Mike Katz",
            "content": "The only other thing I would add is we are also seeing more and more customers pick both at the point of sale. I think a dynamic that's been driven by exactly what you just said, Mike, this powerful bundling that we have done with Magenta MAX. And we continue to see growth coming from the two areas that Mike said upfront, about two-thirds coming from suburban and urban environments, where they are switching from cable, and one-third coming from rural, where we are the only high speed alternative and that's been an exciting area and pocket of growth that we will continue to expand as the network expands. A little over half were switching from cable and here's an interesting thing that came out in the Ookla study this past month. It -- and this is based on comprehensive -- it's Ookla comprehensive speed test. And for the first time, T-Mobile 5G surpassed the nationwide speeds of cable providers, looking at Comcast and Charter on cable connections as compared to T-Mobile customers on 5G smartphones, the T-Mobile customer 5G speed test nationwide median were higher and that really shows you one more data point on the competitiveness of our ability to use this network to serve high speed Internet customers. Okay, second question. Yeah. Hey. Roger, thanks for the question. I do think in a world where people only differentiate off of giving free phones, the risk that you point out is a real one. And in our model, we recognize that a lot of the competition has moved to free devices and we feel like we have done a really good job figuring out how to deliver on free devices but not make that our big point of differentiation. Our big point of differentiation is what you have heard from several of us today, it's this value proposition that gives customers the best value without having to make any trade-offs on network and that proposition, I think, is more important now than it ever has been before, because with the macroeconomic environment, customers are looking for ways to save money and not have to make trade-offs and experience and really only T-Mobile is the one that provides that. Right now, T-Mobile customers, T-Mobile families can save $225 on T-Mobile, not just through their core wireless services, but with all the value that we pack into a plan like Magenta MAX and the included benefits that we give in things like streaming services and everything else. So I think what you are seeing is and what you will continue to see is customers picking us because we have the best overall value position, because we can save them in expenses across their entire lives and that's translating into things like you saw this quarter with sequential and big year-over-year churn decreases. And as it relates to connected devices, we are also watching usage and it's very important that those devices are actively used and paid for and they are. And so that's something that's very important so we don't get question. Okay. Let's go back to the phones. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe I will sit churn, and then Jon can talk about distribution. I think it's too early. We launched this business one year ago. So it's too early to make like big broad comments about churn. The thing that I will point to that we have said in some of our earliest comments is, NPS on this product is amongst the best and broadband providers only vested by one fiber provider by a single point. And then the performance that customers are getting is they are not making any trade-offs and I think that's one of the things that's really resonating with customers is a great price that's reliable and predictable and not making a trade-off on their incumbent service. And I think that's what's resonating with customers and that will be a big part of our strategy, is making more customers aware of that going forward. I don't know, Jon, if you want to talk about distribution?"

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we delivered another strong quarter with our Q2 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% for the second quarter in a row. This just highlights our profitable growth strategy when compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA margins that you see from others in our industry. That growth in profitability fueled higher operating cash flow and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow, while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. And finally, I wanted to highlight a few special items that impacted earnings for the quarter. As we foreshadowed last quarter with the shutdown of the Sprint network, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business. As a result, we took a non-cash impairment charge of $477 million on a pretax basis in Q2. In addition, we recorded a $400 million pretax charge related to the $350 million class action settlement and other expenses from the data breach one year ago, which was within our guidance expectations for the year. All right, let's jump into the details of our increased guidance across the Board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 6 million and 6.3 million, up 600,000 at the midpoint, reflecting both the great execution of our differentiated growth strategy and progress on reducing sprint churn. We continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds will be coming from phones for the full year. As we mentioned last quarter, the net adds guidance does not include the subset of customers who we do not expect to migrate upon our network sunsets, which were treated as a base adjustment. As we began the orderly network shutdowns at the end of Q2, we took an adjustment of 284,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 946,000 postpaid other devices that were not practical to be upgraded. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $26 billion and $26.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $150 million from our prior guidance, driven by our profitable growth in service revenues and merger synergies. This excludes leasing revenues, which we expect to be between $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as we continue to transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, up $200 million at the midpoint as we unlock more network savings driven by accelerated site decommissioning. Merger-related costs, which are not included in core adjusted EBITDA and are expected to be between $4.7 billion and $5.0 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. With Q2 being the peak quarter, we expect that Q3 will be closer to Q1 levels, and then taper off in Q4. Net cash provided by operating activities including payments for merger-related costs are now expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint and up $250 million from the prior guidance. Turning to cash CapEx, we now expect it to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion, which is up $250 million at the midpoint with both the robust pace of our 5G deployment and our success in high-speed Internet, where we capitalize the routers. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion, which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year, even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we successfully executed our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 3%. And we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 2% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. Before I wrap up, I want to celebrate an important milestone of achieving an investment grade corporate family rating for the first time in our company's history. With the Moody's upgrade last week, in addition to our existing investment-grade rating from Fitch, T-Mobile now has investment grade ratings from two of the three top ratings agencies. This is proof of the investment community's confidence in our Un-carrier playbook, delivering on our substantial -- delivering on our accelerated merger integration and synergies, executing on our differentiated growth strategy and our ability to translate that into unprecedented free cash flow. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Absolutely. All right, Dave. And on your other question of core adjusted EBITDA and what are we seeing from inflation, what are we seeing from DISH and with synergies up $200 million and core adjusted EBITDA of $150 million, what are some of the delta items in there. So, first, just with regards to DISH, I think we are very pleased to have reached agreement, gone through all of the settlements of the disputes, as well as the CDMA shutdown and we are looking forward to being great partners with DISH in the future. The agreement, as of the struck, gives us tremendous visibility into what revenues will be in the coming years. And while that's down over Analyst Day expectations, it's about three quarters of what we anticipated at Analyst Day through the duration of the plan period, so very pleased with that. The other thing I will say from an inflation perspective, as we have talked before, there's been a great, great work by Neville and his team to early on lock in a lot of our significant cost into long-term contracts, whether that was on the CapEx side, with the OEM vendors as the network rollout happened, whether it was with tower operators, whether that was with backhaul. So we have been able to get a lot of those costs fixed. Of course, we are seeing some pressure, as everybody else is, particularly in the labor space, but that's all contemplated into the guide itself. Synergy is up $200 million is just, again, speaks to Neville and his team and how quickly they are moving on decommissioning in a very efficient and customer-friendly manner. And the other thing I will point to is, we just raised net adds guidance by 600,000 at the midpoint. So, obviously, the S part of SG&A will be the thing that we are investing in to drive that growth, as well as that quicker acceleration of the network allows Neville to continue building quicker and you have some earlier costs associated with that, which of course, pays off in the ability to acquire customers with this value prop. So those are all the components as I think about them. No. I think you hit it all really well. Yeah. Jonathan, as you know, all of the -- because of all the reasons that Mike just described around an emerging business, while we are best positioned to capture it, it wasn't something that we built into the plan when we did Analyst Day targets, because it was too early. We didn't want to make the plan with something that we didn't have a good view and a road map to how to get the growth, but we are seeing the capitalization of that. So that is all upside, potential upside to the plan, very excited about that. In terms of progression in enterprise space, you heard Callie say we are actually, what's exciting about this is, we see growth across the entire T-Mobile for business segment. It's not just enterprise, it's government, it's SMB. So we are excited about the progression in all of those categories against our goals. Yeah. Definitely. We are not giving the prime mix of the base. Obviously, very recent, but it is up significantly. In terms of what we are seeing from a payment pattern perspective, on a year-over-year basis involve churn is up, and remember, last year was tremendously muted. There was still a lot of stimulus money. There was still not really the switching activity happening. So we are seeing what we anticipated is that you would see an increase involve churn still below pre-pandemic levels for us. And we talked about bad debt a little bit, and of course, what we did in Q2 as well is, remember, the accounting standard changed a couple of years ago and now forces us rightfully so to look forward as well. And so we did a macroeconomic loss overlay in Q2 that was significant, whereas last year, that wasn't happening. In fact, we had some releases happen as we saw involve churn way down. So I do believe Q2, of course, we are watching the macroeconomic trends very carefully and customer payment patterns and behavior, but I believe Q2, based on everything we are seeing now, was the high watermark in terms of bad debt expense for us in 2022. Again, it goes back to that tremendous core competency that we have that we actually built on even further when we saw some of the FCC holds happen, we created even further differentiated tools to help our customers and we are seeing that pay off in dividends now. Mike, I can speak to that one maybe and Mike would do fixed wireless. In terms of migration of rate plans, you saw certainly in the first part of last year, as we said, we did a significant amount of the rate plan migrations to the target rate plans. There's still some more of that to go in planned, both this year as well as the start of next year, but we are through the vast majority of it. I think inferred in the question was also, when are we going through the billing migration, which we always said, was going to be disconnected from the network migration to make it a seamless to the customer as we can and that plan goes through middle of next year as we build the capabilities on and then really seamlessly convert customers, which has already begun. We are already in the process of doing that. But to make that, again, is churn friendly and as consumer-friendly as possible, that's going to go through mid-next year. And so maybe I can..."

We have got it service from a digital point of view. Our telesales teams, et cetera. And then just most recently in the previous quarter, we announced this and launched this in Metro by T-Mobile. So we are still driving that and ramping it, like Mike said, we have got quite a bit of opportunity here still. When you think about an underserved segment like our prepaid customers with high speed Internet, so many of these customers don't even have a product, they can't get it. They can't afford it except from your typical mainstream cable provider. And what you can get with this particular product at the price point with the all-in total cost of ownership is just incredible. So we continue to see that we have more runway here. We are continuing to build that and we might have even more distribution opportunities with other partners in the future as well."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So it's been an exciting time to spend time with CIOs and CTOs as they are looking at their own digital transformation. They are looking at their own ways to manage costs, be efficient and effective, and get connectivity that is on not only the largest and fastest, most reliable 5G network, but the only provider that has a 5G standalone port, which CIOs understand that matters to solutions like Advanced Network Services. We talked about how we launched Business Internet as a part of our Internet Freedom Un-carrier move this past quarter. But for business, this was significant because we are the only provider that truly has nationwide 5G Internet for businesses, which allows us a really great frontdoor to sit down and talk about, yes, we can connect your retail locations, working with places like Tractor Supply and Circle K and AutoZone, but we also are sitting down and talking about, hey, how can we use edge compute solutions and IoT connectivity in order to really help you solve the business problems that you are facing as leaders. We also launched or announced our relationship, our new customer, Cell GP. You don't know Cell GP, that's the world's most extreme sailing competition and we saw in the last rate 240,000 data points transferred from 6,400 sensors, and we were able to deliver up to a 50% reduction in latency. That gives athletes a competitive advantage and fans of really in view of the race, so broadcasting retail. We are also doing a lot of work with this advanced network solutions in the automotive industry. And because of our relationship with DT and our TIoT platform that we launched and told you about last quarter, we are able to provide seamless global connectivity for their B2B2C solutions, as well as for employees who are traveling internationally as a part of our last and most recent Un-carrier moves. So we have seen a lot of action. And we don't want to discount full line here. I mean we like to have the phone lines and we are seeing the lowest levels of business phone churn in our history and I think we just heard that Verizon reported some of their highest. And so we are growing in business. We are growing in enterprise in SMB and in the public sector as well and we are very interested in where we are headed with these Advanced Network Solutions. Right. I mean, we had did some great work with AutoZone and General Mills, we spoke, we did an interesting solution using ANS and edge compute and some smart warehousing, where we built a combination private network and public network. We have been working with a lot of global automakers using both our TIoT capabilities, as well as edge solution for vehicle-to-vehicle communication. And then another cool thing in SMB, because we are seeing a lot of growth in SMB as well, we just announced -- we partnered with Apple to launch the only wireless plan that includes Apple Business Essentials, which is really cool for small businesses to really where they are looking at cost, when they are looking at getting more efficient and effective, how they can manage all of their devices at once with an incredible rate plan and an iPhone 13 included. So that was a really big announcement recently."

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Simon. You have opened the door for me to talk about 5G network, lots to talk about. Quote-unquote, I will be brief. The in-home broadband story, it's just a tremendous testament to the progress we have made with rolling out at a really accelerated pace to our 5G network. I mean, we clearly have a very strong leadership position on 5G. It's significant. It's durable. We are here to lead on this 5G story for years to come. And so we announced in the materials today our low-band network, now 320 million people covered, 97% of all Americans. Our mid-band footprint, our ultra-capacity 5G, which is where the 5G story really comes to life, 235 million people covered well on our way to 260 million by the end of this year and that footprint covers 87% of T-Mobile customers today. So a tremendous progress, we are actually hitting some of the highest production rates in our two year history rolling out mid-band, well over 1,000 sites moved into various radio upgrades on a weekly basis inside the month of July, so real momentum across the Board. And what we can do on in-home broadband, to your question, Simon, is a real product. This in-home product is in-home broadband product is a testament to our 5G network growth. And as Mike referenced, our Ookla report, if you look at the fixed broadband industry and the median speeds, it's lower than what T-Mobile is being recorded as delivering on a median speed basis. And so it's not just about footprint, it's about capacity and the spectrum story and today we have over 110 megahertz of dedicated mid-band spectrum on average across that mid-band footprint and over 30 megahertz of extended range 5G spectrum. So 140 megahertz of dedicated 5G spectrum and it's that capability of coverage, plus 5G depth and spectrum that allows us to push into these 5G broadband stories and this growth. And we are really, I mean, we are a year into this business, Simon. We are very confident about the projections and capabilities that we have mapped out over the coming years. But this network is really starting to now gain traction. The integration with Sprint is all over by the shelving, to be honest, two-thirds of the sites have been de-commed, less than 1% of the Sprint traffic -- customer traffic now on that legacy Sprint network, high confidence. We will bring that to a close as we exit this quarter. And that's driving a ton of goodness. The spectrum that we can migrate and move across, the coverage and the capabilities that come with one very strong powerhouse network and a little over two years from when we started this process. So great progress, very confident in what we are delivering, delighted with the speeds that we are delivering on in-home broadband and I think we are bringing to the market probably the real first 5G use case. Everybody has been hunting for this thing. But in-home broadband, fixed wireless is here and it's here to stay. Yeah. I mean, I think, we -- I'd say this, Craig. We are the best positioned company in the U.S. for all of 5G opportunities that Callie outlined. There's just no doubt. I mean, this 5G thing is for real at T-Mobile. I mean more than 50% of our entire network traffic is now on 5G, over 55%, actually and that number continues to increase as we see great engagement and great discussions with all manner of opportunities, business leaders, as well as our consumer base. And we continue to really push the 5G architecture. We are the only company, as Callie referenced, with a standalone network core. We are the only company in the U.S. to push -- to move voice services, voice over a new radio onto that 5G layer. Why is that important? Because as a company, we are a 5G business, we are not in the business yet of retiring LTE, but we are focused on that at some point in time in the coming years. This 5G network is moving at incredible pace, coverage, spectrum and architecture. And we have a lead on all corners of that dialogue against our competition, which positions us incredibly well for future growth across all segments. So delighted with our progress and the 5G story is not just beginning. I mean, we are into it at T-Mobile and the growth vectors are starting to shape up around us incredibly well. Well, I am not sure that we want to announce revised numbers today. So, I mean, Jonathan, you know our story well. You know the $7 million to $8 million that we put out into the marketplace some time back. But to Mike's comments just now, if you look at where we are, we are ahead on our coverage rollout on 5G, we are ahead on our spectrum transition, we are ahead on our integration goals that we established when we put that plan together. There are many factors coming in, but we see great consumer adoption on the 5G side and our capacity generation for this business is ahead of schedule. We always said that, if you compare where this business would be as a combined T-Mobile and Sprint in 2024, 2025 against the standalone T-Mobile, that multiple was about a 14x, 1-4 on capacity. We are about halfway through that already in terms of the capacity we are generating. So we are in the business of creating a lot of headroom for growth for the company. And can we bend that curve some more? I am sure we can, but we are still early into this business. As we said, we are a year in driving great numbers, and we will see, I think, as we exit this year with continued strong growth in the space, we will be in a position to look forward into 2023 and 2024 with great momentum and hopefully some stronger numbers."

I know Callie may have some good things to talk about there. And to your point earlier on our coverage announcement, curious how that's impacting the business broadly both consumer and B2B? Sure. This is a great question from Roger about churn. You are growing significantly with often free connected devices. How are you going to prevent to have the same to your churn off experience that the others are having -- have experienced when they drove connected device net adds, kind of ties to Alan's question about churn from some of the smaller players as well."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. Well, you can see, if you are watching us live on the web stream, we have got most of our senior team here in New York City today and we are here to share our Q2 results and I am extremely proud of our team for delivering another quarter of great results while completing major integration milestones. Q2 was another strong quarter of industry-leading growth for us in customers, postpaid service revenues and EBITDA, and based on our momentum, we are raising our full year guidance across the board again. This just shows that the Un-carrier playbook, putting customers first and providing them with the best value and the best network, continues to work in a competitive climate and in the changing macroeconomic environment. Before I go into our results, I do want to take a moment to acknowledge this challenging economic climate for consumers and businesses and what T-Mobile is doing to help customers stay connected. Inflation has been dominating headlines and dinner table conversations. It's a reality that millions of American families are facing as prices every day for essentials are skyrocketing all around them. That's why we did what the Un-carrier does best with three big moves last quarter to help customers when they need it most. Prioritizing customers' needs is exactly what continues to fuel our growth. Others in the industry notified their customers that their already overpriced bills are going up when they could least afford it. Naturally, some have asked when will T-Mobile raise its rates. Well, building on our proud history as the Un-carrier, our answer is that we are not. Instead, we introduced price lock. We are standing by our commitment to customers and those who switched to T-Mobile that we won't raise the price of their rate plans. We are here to help broadband customers across the country as well with our recent launch of Internet Freedom. Broadband customers are some of the least satisfied in America, the fees, the contracts, the price hikes, the terrible customer service, it's all ridiculous and it looks a lot like the wireless industry a decade ago. But it's all changing because we are making it easy for customers to break up with big Internet, lock in their price and finally feel appreciated. And we made T-Mobile Business Internet available nationwide, which makes T-Mobile the first and only nationwide Internet provider for business. And third, we saw another opportunity to help customers as travel is on the rebound. But like everything else, travel has become more expensive and more complicated. So T-Mobile launched Coverage Beyond to help people get back out there and save money while doing it. We have got customers covered across the U.S., on their airline flights, on the road and in more than 210 countries and destinations. This is what the Un-carrier is all about, chasing down customer pain points and smashing them, and right now, with this economy, there are a lot of pain points out there. And you know what? This strategy works again and again. We delivered another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth. In fact, we posted a record 380,000 postpaid account net adds. The highest in company history and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I have said before, this measure of total billing relationships is a strong barometer that we are winning the switching decisions in this industry. I know the competitive market trends are top of mind and here's what we saw in Q2. Postpaid switching activity increased year-over-year and we benefited from more than our fair share of those switching decisions. Importantly, our network and brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers, driving the prime mix of our customer base to an all-time high. And we delivered our highest ever Q2 postpaid net additions with an industry best 1.7 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined again. This includes 723,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped 13 basis points sequentially to 0.80 and we were the only wireless service provider to improve year-over-year. In fact, delivering lower churn than Verizon for the first time ever on a combined basis including Sprint. The fact that our all-in churn, including Sprint, is trending so strongly just two years out from our merger shows our team's fantastic progress and it is exactly what we told you would happen. Okay, let's talk about high-speed Internet, where our team delivered 560,000 net additions. I am pretty confident that we will see T-Mobile as the fastest growing broadband provider in the industry for the third consecutive quarter and most likely by a wide margin. Demand continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. I am so excited to see our broadband business hit this pace, which puts us right on track to meet the multiyear ambitions we shared with you last year. We continue to see great customer adoption of Magenta MAX, which is helping drive our strong ARPU and ARPA trends. With the trends we are seeing, we now expect postpaid ARPA to be up roughly 3% in 2022. These results reflect our differentiated strategy to unlock growth across smaller markets and rural areas, T-Mobile for Business, network seekers in the top 100 markets who hadn't previously considered us and in new product categories like 5G broadband. They also reflect the strength of our network leadership, as supported by nearly every third party. Recent reports from Ookla and PC Magazine not only recognize T-Mobile for the fastest and most available 5G network, but for the best overall network experience. And OpenSignal recently reported that not only did our average speeds increase yet again, the gap over the competition widened even further despite their C-band deployments. We are winning this race, and as I have been telling you, we plan to stay ahead. And speaking of network, we just hit some major integration milestones. Just over two years since we closed the merger, we have successfully shutdown most of the Sprint network. As of the end of the quarter, we had cumulatively decommissioned nearly two-thirds of the 35,000 targeted sites and can now report that we will be substantially complete by the end of Q3 this current quarter, remarkable work by the team to deliver these milestones ahead even of our recent year-end target and more than one year earlier than our original merger plan. Before I wrap up, I want to touch on cybersecurity, following the criminal attack we experienced roughly a year ago. Protecting our customers' data is a top priority for the company, which is why following the attack we immediately took additional steps to protect our customers. We created a cyber transformation office and engaged some of the top -- world's top experts to help. We are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance our data security tools and capabilities to transform our cybersecurity program. We always knew that there would unfortunately be financial consequences from this attack and we were pleased to recently reach settlements that will resolve the class actions and most of the consumer claims. Together, we believe these settlements will represent the biggest component of those impacts. These costs were contemplated in our financial guidance and the amounts are consistent with precedents we have seen in other similar agreements. We are now focused on moving forward as we continue to invest in and enhance our company's cybersecurity. Okay, let me give a quick recap before I hand things over to Peter. I am very pleased with our company's performance and progress against our ambitious multiyear goals. Again, this quarter, we outperformed against our plans, and again, led the industry in net additions of postpaid customers and growth in postpaid service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows, and as a result, we raised our guidance across the board again. The Un-carrier value proposition resonates, and it's so well tuned to the tax. People want the best network and now more than ever they wanted at the best value from a team that's obsessed with their satisfaction. Our strategy is so simple, but maybe that's why it works quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights from Q2 and our increased guidance for 2022 in more detail. Hi, David. I will start with the first and then, like, get Peter wound up to answer the second one. First of all, I just want to congratulate this whole team and our finance department and Peter, first and foremost, for achieving this major milestone. We have sought to be an investment-grade issuer for many years. It's been a goal of ours and now we have two of the three rating agencies. I certainly hope to see S&P soon. And that's just an exciting moment for us and particularly with what has happened this year in the high yield market, it's particularly important. As we have said all along about the share buybacks, there was no preset designated things that needed to be accomplished before our Board would deliberate on this. But with where high yield markets are right now, clearly, this is a very important milestone. Unfortunately, we don't have an update for you other than to reiterate what we told you in the past, looking at all of our momentum, our financial performance, we continue to see upwards of $60 billion in share buybacks in 2023, 2024 and 2025 in total with the possibility of beginning sooner, and absolutely, nothing has changed on that front, but we have accomplished some very important milestones toward that end. David, that last point is particularly important to me. As you have seen something from this report, you have seen that we have incredible momentum right now on growth. I mean more postpaid net additions than AT&T and Verizon combined, plus or including 560,000, by and large, high-speed Internet connections and those things cost us money to generate that growth in an in-period basis. So we are anticipating, as you saw in the guide, continued success there. Also, our accounting approach, as Peter has explained in the past, is a little different than our competitors. We take the preponderance of those costs in period rather than racking up millions of dollars on our balance sheet that would come in the form of negative revenue charges later. So those are some of the key things that explain the difference between the increase in synergies and the increase in EBITDA. You bet. Let's come back to the phones. Great. Well, I will jump in first and then turn it to Neville. I am so delighted with what's happening here. I mean 560,000 net adds is a run rate that, if you just do the math, it gets us to the goals that we have established. And so this is really now a run rate business that we are very excited to be seeing success around. And not a lot has changed in that it remains the case that the majority of our net additions are coming from existing T-Mobile customers. And that's terrific to see and we not only like that trend, but we doubled down on it with offers during the quarter. As you saw, Internet Freedom put in an exciting offer for Magenta MAX customers to create a bundle and we have seen the uptake of that has been really terrific. So, for example, loading of the new high-speed Internet product late in the quarter and early in this quarter has been coming in a little above $45, as compared to $49 to $50 in the base. So you see that you are getting the benefit of that bundle blended in now and most of the sales continue to be to our existing customers. That being said, it also is a terrific front door for the company and you can see that it's driving new relationships. But increasingly, those new relationships are not just stopping at high speed Internet. So they are coming in buying high speed Internet and then going ahead and switching, including Magenta MAX. So that's starting to work as a very successful cycle. Anything to add to that, Mike or Jon? That's all the time we have. Simon, one of the things that Neville said, I think, has been under discussed, which is how much spectrum we have against this leading mid-band 5G footprint. There's a lot of discussion about fact that we have 235 million people covered with mid-band ultra capacity 5G as compared to 70 for AT&T, 135 for Verizon, as they begin their C-band deployments. But what's really interesting is what Neville said about the depths of spectrum across that 235 on average. He said 110 megahertz of mid-band, plus 30 of low band, 140 dedicated to that 5G layer, and that's unique and it will be unique for some time to come. And it really allows for the kinds of capacity throughput and performance that we have been talking about on this call. It opens up not just high speed Internet opportunities but really exciting opportunities in the business space that our competitors can issue press releases around, but where we are ready to execute and support businesses right now with advanced network 5G services. So we will talk more about that later. But thanks for your question about that. Okay. Next caller. Hey, John. Yeah. Absolutely, John. Well, first, let me just take the first question on what we are seeing. You saw that our bad debt returned to more historic levels this quarter and we are very comfortable with it at this level. One of the things that makes us different than our competitors in this space is we have a long history and a deep confidence at dealing with customers who have variable economic circumstances. And so it's not new for us that some customers are stressed up financially. We know how to work with them on that front and you have seen our bad debt levels return to more historic rates. There have been other things driving that debt as well. One of the things you see is that our EIT balances continue to rise. And in EIT balances, when those go bad, it hits that bad debt metric as opposed to leasing, which we have been rapidly moving customers off does not. So there's an artifact there. There's also some accounting artifacts that cause us to be more forward looking in our bad debt charges now than before, plus the return to more historic norms. Long way of saying, we are very comfortable with where it is and we know how to execute in this environment. But to your point, it's very interesting. There is a flight to value that I believe is beginning to happen. You see it in our suppressed churn rates as people are comfortable where they are, our progress across both T-Mobile and Sprint to the premise of your question, our net add performance, our overall account growth performance was the highest ever in our history for any quarter in any season was this quarter, 380,000 new account additions. And so there is a flight to value that is beginning to happen and T-Mobile is famous for value in our category. At a time when this product category is becoming more and more indispensable, we are famous for value while showing you that we are second to none on the quality of the product and so that's something that I think positions us very, very well for the times. On that 0.80, look, I am just so proud of the team. We told you two years ago that we would execute our worst to first playbook and a lot of people looked at us and said, yeah, but you have got Sprint now. And here we are with 0.80 in combined churn and possibly some room to run. We will see where we go. There's obviously offsetting pressures here on the involve side that all of the carriers are seeing. But we look at Q3 and it looks to us like we will be 2021 churn by a similar margin in Q3 as we beat it in Q2, mid-to-high single-digit bps improvement versus last year, and of course, there's seasonal effects in the second half of the year as switching tends to be higher due to phone launches. So we are very comfortable with what we are seeing and we believe that as we continue to get more and more Sprint customers settled with the right rate plans, which is the last component of our integration that potentially there's some more momentum to see in the quarters ahead. Anything to add to that, Peter? Okay. Thanks, John. Okay, Operator? You bet, Craig. Let me first start by saying, we are a lot further along in this space and in thinking around it and execution around it, then you would probably surmise from our press releases. And I will have Kelly talk about some of what's going on out there. But we are hesitant to take an early business like this and forecast it forward for you when it's in its infancy. Our competitors haven't had much choice about that, and so they have gone ahead and given some big aspirations in this area. But our view is it's an emerging market and we can achieve what we set out to achieve, generally speaking, in the core business. But that being said, there are exciting things happening, and what's interesting is this 5G network leadership is getting us conversations with CIOs, CEOs, the coroner office that our company never earned before. We were talking about smartphone plans with the procurement office two years ago and that's the big difference. And Callie, maybe you can share a little bit of what you are seeing and the kinds of conversations you and your team are having. I am glad you mentioned coverage beyond and all that, too, because not only are there incredible opportunities for us to do deep services for enterprises as they look to create network-as-a-service and outsource some of that thinking to advanced networks like ours, but we are still interested in the core. And coverage beyond was an investment in something that originally put map with enterprises in the first place. Our simple global move in 2013 was our introduction to enterprise. And today, we have launched coverage beyond, which not just doubles down, it multiplies the power of that move by many times so that now business customers and consumers can travel the world and have high speed data, the highest on offer in that country completely included in our most popular plan, not low speed data and it is a breakthrough. So we are very excited about what that portends for our business customers and consumers. Neville, I will give you the last word on this question. Beautiful. Okay. And before we go back to the phones, I know we have some coming in on Twitter. I see a few upfront. Janice, did you find some what we should be tackling here? Anything to double down, I know you just kind of answered some of that. So lots of exciting new logos, only some of which we say because of agreements with customers. But the other thing that's happening that's really interesting is that we are deepening relationships with enterprise customers across the board. Remember, a couple of years ago, we were kind of winning some accounts along the lines of, hey, if I throw you a few of my lines kind of unofficially, will you help me re-price my AT&T business, and you will get some of my. That's never really spoken, but you can see the RFPs were sort of designed for that. And what happens now is some years later, customers are coming back and saying, actually, I'd like you to bid for the whole kit and caboodle now. And so this potential to deepen with customers is really happening and that's a dynamic that's driving our sales. So, hopefully, Roger and Bill that answer some of your questions about TFP. So, Jess, get ready for the next one. I will go back to the phone while we do that. So, Operator? Great. Let me start with Peter to talk about the last two questions about the plan and the 20% share, et cetera, and then we will give it back to your earlier questions, Jon. It kind of depends. One of the things that we have disclosed in the past that our model, which is an excess capacity model is based on our anticipated share gains in mobile. And the usage of our base in mobile, which we expect to continue to rise at a rapid pace arriving in this planning period at around 80 gigs per mobile customer. And maybe that will be higher, maybe that will be lower and that's obviously a very important input to this. And obviously, so is the availability of spectrum, our ability to refarm spectrum, to deploy it, et cetera. But I don't know, do you want to take a stab at answering this question or are we just going to say we don't know, Neville? We have been an early adopter of so many techniques and technologies that have allowed us to unlock capabilities for our customers in the network space. And Neville and Ulf and Doel and their teams are constantly chasing new ideas and capacity is one of the centerpieces of our conversations now because of the premise of your question. So it's a topic we are very interested in. I will tell you that we won't load customers beyond where we can give them a great experience. And right now, our Net Promoter Scores continue to rise. They are 30 points higher than the competition. They are triple what they are from a provider that our customers are switching from. We just won a major nationwide survey of all ISPs that are scaled, named us the second highest in customer satisfaction in the country and number one was a fiber provider. And so our customers love this product and it's really important for us and for our brand that we continue to load customers where we know we can serve them well. And but, hopefully, that gives you some color on where we stand. You bet. We want to go on to Twitter for another one. Yeah. Maybe we start with Mike on this one. I will say, what's going on in the market is very different from what you saw from our competitors some years ago. There aren't, by and large, we are not, by and large, driving this through free devices or free connections. What's happening is we live in a 5G world now and people are getting real utility and value out of tablets, watches and other devices, because of the strength of our network and because of the changing lifestyles of connected lives. But, Mike, maybe you can give a little more on what we are seeing. Sounds good, Phil. So, well, let's go to Peter Osvaldik to say what we are seeing. And like I said in my opening remarks, we are comfortable here and increasing our EBITDA, feel confident with how we are handling the macroeconomic picture. There are places in our P&L where there are pressure points, but there's also a lot of opportunity for us to stand up and serve customers at a time when they need a company to provide them with a fantastic value. Great. Let's go back to the phone. Hi, Brett. You bet. Where do we want to start? Maybe turn to Mike on the first one. Yeah. Yeah. Just on the -- it's harder to answer. You saw we didn't disclose sort of a Sprint migration figure this time only because it's becoming harder and harder to do so. As Neville said in his remarks, less than 1% of the traffic is now on the legacy Sprint network. We will be at network shutdown this quarter, having decommissioned substantially all of the sites. And so now it becomes much more of a picture of, do they have the right rate plan, do they have the right device plan, are we -- have we reengaged with them and gotten the recommitment from them, et cetera? That's a stepwise process. But you can see the incredible progress that we are making with combined churn being at 0.80. And then, as it relates to fixed wireless, first of all, what I said in my remarks was that we have achieved now a pace that if you were to extrapolate it forward gets us to our goals. That wasn't a forecast for you though. That wasn't a prediction that it will be at that pace it could be higher, it could be lower, this is an emerging business, it's going really well. And what's interesting is I don't think we have yet fully tapped our base with this potential. I don't think we have yet fully have the opportunity of prepaid with this potential, which has been newer in distribution. Jon and team have done a fantastic job bringing this to metro. TFB still represents a minority of our connections and yet we are the only one with our most recent Un-carrier move to provide a nationwide broadband service to businesses. The sales cycles there are longer. And it's a good thing that we have lots of potential tailwinds here because, obviously, as the base grows, we know that math is math and churn will grow and that's just obvious. And so we have to outrun that and then some. And we are very confident and feeling like we are in a great spot. Anything both Mike and Jon to add to what we are seeing how distribution is going, the value proposition? And Operator, we can probably squeeze in one last question. Hey, Mike. Okay. On volume, our forecasts don't imply an industry run rate. Our job is to win switching decisions and you saw in our quarter, that's exactly what we did. And so we are not deeply dependent on industry net adds. That being said, what we are seeing is overall switching is up about 3% in the marketplace. We have not seen any substantial changes to that as we have entered into the new quarter or any other substantial changes to the overall competitive dynamics since the quarter ended. So that's what we are seeing across the Board. As it relates to Sprint wireline asset, you may have seen we made some announcements that we are no longer using that asset to support our wireless business. We are obviously conducting a review as to the best way to manage that asset. It's a terrific product with a deep, deep legacy in our company and it's important that we make the right decisions there for the long haul, taking into account how the market has changed over time. M&A, listen, you never rule that out. You never rule that out. That being said, one of the things I hope you are getting from this call is that we are very, very confident as a management team in our ability to execute with the hand we are holding. In a broad market where all content and communications have left their linear forms and have landed on the Internet, and the Internet is going mobile, we are this nation's leading pure-play mobile Internet company and we are executing very solidly for our shareholders with a clear eye towards returning value to those shareholders as a result of our efforts. And so we are very pleased with where we sit, but smart management teams never rule out ways to further benefit our position for shareholders. And that's a great place to leave it. Listen, I hope you got from this call, our confidence. We are having a lot of fun here. We are taking care of our customers. We are leading this company into a new era of the Un-carrier, and quarter-after-quarter where our aspiration is to continue to post results that increase your confidence in us as a management team. Thanks for tuning in today, everybody. Appreciate it."

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the T-Mobile first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During the call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other materials that accompany our Q1 results as well as reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP disclosures can be found on the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, what an exciting time right now at T-Mobile. We have a lot to cover but we'll keep our comments brief this time so that we can get right to your questions. We just celebrated the 2-year anniversary of this merger. We delivered another exciting outperformance in Q1 to kick off 2022. We're in the home stretch of our accelerated integration. And we're raising our guidance for the year across the board based on the momentum that we see in our business. It's hard to believe that it's already been 2 years since we closed our merger with Sprint. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished as we have consistently exceeded not only our own targets but also Wall Street's expectations. One of the cornerstones of our merger advocacy was that we would lead the U.S. into the 5G era. And I don't think very many people anticipated what we've already achieved in just 2 years. We now cover 315 million people with 5G. That's 95% of all Americans. And our 5G geographic coverage with dedicated low-band spectrum is more than Verizon and AT&T have combined which both, by the way, are still largely sharing spectrum with their LTE networks. Perhaps our greatest impact though was to awaken the industry to the transformational performance of mid-band spectrum for Ultra Capacity 5G. We already cover 225 million Americans and nearly 85% of all T-Mobile customers with these game-changing experiences. We caused others to pivot from an apparent willingness to leave fast 5G to a select few customers within arm's reach of a millimeter wave site. And now we see them greatly increasing their investments in mid-band spectrum and deployment. They are trying to chase us but only to realize they will be and are years behind T-Mobile. Pre-merger, we laid out a plan to realize massive synergies from our scale and efficiencies only to raise our run rate synergy expectations by 25% after closing the merger. We're delivering these synergies bigger and faster than expected to the benefit of our shareholders. And synergies are ramping up even further this year as we're approaching some of our biggest milestones, including moving the remaining customers off the Sprint network in the next couple of month just over 2 years from merger close. And we're also on track to upgrade or decommission substantially all of the Sprint sites this year, less than 3 years from close. We've been selectively decommissioning sites since the merger close. And as of Q1, we've decommissioned roughly 1/3 of the 35,000 targeted sites, with the big push coming in the second half of this year. Remarkable execution by the team as we pulled these milestones forward by more than a year. At the Un-carrier, we're committed to use our 5G leadership and synergies for the good of consumers and businesses, eliminating the biggest pain point in this industry where customers were forced to make trade-offs between network quality and value. As the only national wireless provider with a clearly articulated and differentiated growth strategy, we have led the industry in postpaid customer and service revenue growth in the 2 years since the merger closed. In that time, we've delivered roughly 2 million postpaid account net adds and 11.5 million postpaid net adds, including an industry-best 5.3 million postpaid phone net adds. We were also the only national wireless operator to deliver double-digit growth in both service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA over that period. And we accomplished this while building the foundation for sustainable growth platforms across enterprise and government, smaller markets in rural areas, prime consumers in the largest 100 markets and bringing real competition to broadband. We've unlocked new experiences for consumers, like the first truly unlimited 5G plan with Magenta MAX. And we've established T-Mobile as the fastest-growing broadband provider, bringing a better product and value proposition to over 40 million potential households and already serving over 1 million customers, just a year after our commercial launch. We are carrying this momentum right into 2022, delivering another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth in Q1 built on the incredible momentum of our Magenta brand. We added 348,000 postpaid account net adds, our highest Q1 ever and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I've said before, this measure of our total billing relationships is the best barometer that we're winning the switching decisions in this industry. While others appear to be leaning into adding lines to their base, we are focused on growing the number of customer relationships and then deepening them over time across our products and services. And we delivered our highest Q1 postpaid net adds in 8 years with an industry best 1.3 million. That's more postpaid nets than AT&T and Verizon combined. This includes 589,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped by a whopping 17 basis points from Q4 to just 0.93, the industry best improvement both year-over-year and sequentially. We were the only national wireless operator to improve churn year-over-year as our competitors saw their churn increase. This integration-driven churn improvement really matters because our phone gross adds were the highest in the industry yet again in Q1. In fact, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q1 would have been closer to 900,000. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where we had 338,000 net adds and I expect will be the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry for the second consecutive quarter. Demand just continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. Our Net Promoter Scores continue to improve quarter-over-quarter and, are now more than 3x the average NPS scores for cable customers. The best part is we're just getting started bringing the Un-carrier to broadband. So stay tuned for what we have in store next. Magenta MAX continues to see great adoption from customers which is helping to drive strong ARPU and ARPA trends and we still have lots of room for further growth. With the trends that we're seeing, we now expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up roughly 1% in 2022. In addition, we continue to see our prime mix of credit apps increased on a year-over-year basis each quarter, showing that our network and our brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers. We continue to see good momentum in smaller markets and rural areas as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. The team is executing our precision playbook here to a T, coordinating the network and distribution build-outs to unlock new experiences community by community. We ended 2021 effectively competing in about 30% of households in these markets and will continue to expand to more than half of households in smaller markets by the end of this year. Our new accounts from smaller markets and rural areas grew 40% year-over-year in Q1. And these markets are also a great example of where our high-speed Internet is helping to open doors for us to drive mobile penetration. T-Mobile for Business continues to build mind share with enterprise and government customers on the strength of our network and our ever-expanding suite of products and services. We've built strong momentum across major verticals now, such as the financial sector, where we continue to expand the list of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for secure and compliant connectivity for their hybrid mobile workforce. Our network performance has also been a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile just in Q1. We recently introduced the first 5G connected cars in America with Magenta Drive for BMW. And we continue to be on the leading edge of advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our significant and durable 5G network advantage. Okay, let me wrap up. It's been a remarkable run in the first 2 years since our merger. We've unlocked better experiences for consumers and businesses by offering the best value and the promise of the best network for the first time in this industry's history. We've unlocked shareholder value through industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and service revenues while delivering merger synergies bigger and faster than originally planned. We're off to a great start in 2022 with a beat-and-raise quarter that not only led this industry in growth of postpaid customers but also service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. And positioned us to raise our guidance across the board just 1 quarter into the year. Our team is excited to carry all this momentum through the rest of '22 and I'll let Peter take you through our key financial highlights from Q1 and our increased guidance in more detail. Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we started off 2022 with very strong Q1 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and highest postpaid phone ARPU growth in the last 5 years resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on our merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA that you see from others in our industry. That growth and profitability fueled higher operating cash flow even with higher merger-related costs and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow of over 25% while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. So let's talk about how our great execution in Q1 set us up to raise guidance across the board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.8 million, up 300,000 at the midpoint, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue our accelerated Sprint customer migration. We continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year more weighted to the second half, with the Sprint migration impacts more in the first half and expansion in smaller markets and rural areas building throughout the year. Consistent with Q1, this net adds guidance does not include the small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint networks which will be treated as a base adjustment. As we began the CDMA sunset at the end of Q1, we took an adjustment of 212,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 349,000 postpaid other devices which were largely low ARPU IoT devices. We expect to begin the LTE sunset at the end of Q2 and estimate a base adjustment of approximately 300,000 postpaid phones and between 700,000 and 900,000 lower ARPU postpaid other devices. The anticipated impact of these adjustments is relatively immaterial and fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $25.8 billion and $26.2 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $150 million from the prior guidance, driven by our growth in service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues which we continue to expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and weighted to the second half of the year, primarily as we unlock more network savings as site decommissioning accelerates. As a result of timing of synergies within the year, the impacts from the Sprint network onset and an expected slight sequential decline in wholesale revenue, we expect core adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be similar to Q1 and then higher in the second half. Merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA are still expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. We expect slightly over 1/3 of the total to occur in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $100 million from the prior guidance. With the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, we now expect cash CapEx to be between $13.2 billion and $13.5 billion which is up $100 million at the midpoint as we capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer network experience. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And additionally, as we execute our strategy to continuously deepen our cap relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 2%. As Mike also mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 1% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. And finally, with the shutdown of the Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business, triggering an impairment analysis. As a result of the wireless network shutdown, we anticipate a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million in Q2. The cessation of wireless traffic also enables monetization of certain wireless assets to the wireline assets which were previously supporting the wireless traffic. Any cash monetization of these wireline assets would be recorded as gains in future periods if they occur. Altogether, we see 2022 as another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. What I find most exciting is our unique opportunity to unlock significant free cash flow by delivering industry-leading growth in customers, service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A.\nJud Henry: All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] All right. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Your first question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Two quick ones, I think. First, have you guys seen any slowdown in sort of store traffic or gross adds in March or heading into April? We heard something like that from Verizon. I just want to -- doesn't sound like it given Peter's commentary about growth accelerating through the year. And then similarly on inflation, any impact on your business from what we're seeing in the U.S. from higher inflation?\nMike Sievert: We've heard some of that, too, John and not really but I'll let Jon give you a little color on what we're seeing in retail and as we engage with the consumer. And then I'll come back and talk about inflation.\nJon Freier: Yes, you bet. John, yes, we're not seeing any of that. What we're seeing is a great Q1, as we've reported, with 348,000 postpaid net accounts and 1.3 million total postpaid. And when you look at what we're seeing in March and April, we're actually seeing the seasonal benefits that you would expect and actually switching and improving on a year-over-year basis. Remember, in Q1 of last year, that was the depth of the pandemic when people were kitty baring the door back in January and February of last year. And today, we're seeing the overall switching activity continuing to improve on a year-over-year basis. So when I look at traffic and I look at all the activity in the marketplace, I'm feeling really, really confident about what we're seeing.\nMike Sievert: You can see that in both of our competitors having elevated churn in Q1 relative to the year ago period. It wasn't the case for us. Our churn is unfolding exactly as we've told you it would. It's driven by merger integration synergies. And we've achieved some really important milestones here on merger integration to where if you think about the customers that have transitioned, Sprint customers that are on the T-Mobile network, with all their traffic predominantly on T-Mobile, who have T-Mobile plans and T-Mobile device plans, those customers are the ones we've been telling you about the churn just like Magenta customers. And those are now 37% of our base. So we brought a substantial minority across. And that was a big factor in driving a whopping 17 basis point sequential churn improvement in just 1 quarter, exactly unfolding the way we told you it would. There's a lot of work left lot to do, obviously. 37% isn't 100%. That's going to take us some time. But it shows you that the thesis that we've been sharing is unfolding exactly as predicted. Now as it relates to inflation, I'm not sure what you're getting at but I'll talk about 2 things here, John. One is from a cost structure standpoint, as we've said in the past, our sector is actually somewhat insulated. Obviously, we need to watch labor costs and variable costs but the vast bulk of our cost structure is in long-term contracts around things like tower contracts, backhaul contracts, technology contracts, those kinds of things that are generally fixed and finite and known over a multiyear period which gives us some insulation from inflation effects. I think the larger question facing our society is what will be the impact of inflation beyond consumers? And the answer is we don't know. Right now, there's a lot of consumer anxiety about inflation. And customers have stressed out budget. What we know is that T-Mobile is famous for being the value leader. We can save a family of 4 on postpaid $900 a year, a year, every year, from switching to T-Mobile. And so as -- we'll have to watch what happens with consumer sentiment here but if it is a difficult time, there's a real opportunity for us to stand up and serve more and more people as the value leader and we'll, of course, be ready to do that.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: So speaking of inflation, AT&T is out there trying to signal prices higher and backed off a little bit on their promotions. I see your current promotions out there. Maybe talk about where you see your competitiveness versus peers and any ability to take price if needed over time.\nMike Sievert: I'll start by saying our envelope of value leadership has been remarkably consistent over time. And so if you look at a multiyear arc, we offer the best value to postpaid consumers. That has been the case for the entire Un-carrier journey. And it's been about consistently the case in terms of the extent of that value leadership. Now we're always introducing new promotions. But I want to be really clear. Our strategy as a company is about showing customers the remarkable value of Magenta MAX. That's our strategy. And you can see how it's unfolding in terms of customers self-selecting up our stack to buy our best products because they are the very best expression of the very best 5G network. And that is running on all cylinders, allowing us today with the best values and with incredible promotions in the market to tell you about for the first time in the 10 years I've been here, an outlook of ARPU rising. And that was something we just did a few minutes ago for the first time in the entire decade I've been here on the strength of this strategy. And so it really shows that we can have it both ways. We can have the best value in the industry, remarkable promotions, bring competition to this market like we always have, to no greater or lesser extent than in our past, while simultaneously showcasing the incredible value of our leading 5G network in the expression of Magenta MAX and attracting customers to that best expression. So it's a really nice place to be. We like this market competitive. We know we're stewards of a healthy and vibrant marketplace that has room for all of us. But one thing is very clear. As it becomes less known, whether they're will be enough room for the Verizons, the new entrants, the cable companies, et cetera, it's very clear that our tailwinds of growth driven by our rational and well-articulated growth strategy is a real differentiator for us. And that's something that I think people need to understand as their -- investors, I know, are looking for growth but they're also looking for reliable safe bets on growth. And that's what we strive to achieve quarter after quarter.\nPhil Cusick: Maybe one more on revenue, if I can. You talked about wholesale revenue down a little bit in the second quarter. How do those wholesale relationships look at this point in terms of the runoff of Boost and TracFone? It seems like those are a lot more stable than we were worried about a couple of quarters ago.\nMike Sievert: Yes. I'll let Mike talk about it. First, I'll just give you some context. I know a quarter ago, we talked about reaching an agreement with DISH as a path forward, that's a real win-win for everybody and that continues to be under review by the Department of Justice. But I will say we've gone forward with DISH in a very productive way and they have with us, really finding a path forward and that's been nice to see for their customers and for all of our businesses. But obviously, we have a large and diverse wholesale base and maybe I'll let Mike Katz tell you about what's happening.\nMichael Katz: Yes. Thanks, Mike. As Mike said, we reached an agreement with DISH. We're waiting for the approval from DOJ. But both companies are operating as if the deal is in place and that partnership has been going really well for us. A couple of things that we talked about last quarter that you've seen come to fruition this quarter. One is we reached a wind-down agreement with TracFone and you're seeing that roll through our numbers. We also reached agreements with -- extension agreements with Google which is a large exclusive scaled MVNO that's in our portfolio. And a new MVNO agreement with Altice. So we're seeing new and expanded MVNO relationships in our portfolio. And we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of growth from the existing companies in the portfolio taking advantage of the network capacity and the network capabilities. So it's a -- wholesale has been a really strong portfolio for us.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: I guess first on the fixed wireless broadband side. Can you provide an update on the experience that customers are getting in terms of download-upload reliability and what you may be seeing in terms of the early retention and satisfaction levels. And then secondly, with the financial guidance up for the year, what are the circumstances under which T-Mobile could consider beginning share repurchases during 2022?\nMike Sievert: Great. I'll start on the first one and maybe ask Neville to pile in. We're really delighted with what we're seeing here. I think this product has been a fantastic showcase of what the leading 5G network can really do. And we're now operating at scale with 1 million customers. Net Promoter Scores have risen again quarter-over-quarter which is terrific to see now 3x the Net Promoter Scores of a cable company. Our download speeds meet the nationwide medians of cable companies. And that's something most people wouldn't really appreciate. Our average usage is 300 to 400 gigs per month and yet we're able to serve that with rising Net Promoter Scores. We have a tail, 10%-ish or so, that are using a terabyte per month. And so these are normative figures that you would see in an industry with a product that's really driving satisfaction. Maybe Neville, you can talk about what's behind it and add any color?\nNeville Ray: Yes. I mean they're great stats, right, when you look at how we are performing and competing in this broadband space. I think everybody said, what happens with 5G? Well, look at what we're doing with this in-home broadband experience. And 1 million customers now, 1 million, our first 1 million, the first 1 million. And so it's coming from just the powerhouse network we have. And I like to say we're just getting started on this 5G story. We're adding a lot of coverage. We're adding a lot of spectrum. And the sheer horsepower that we can provide off this 5G network allows us to support this great and increasing and improving experience. So we're super proud about the performance we have. Customers are really enjoying this product. And to be honest, I'll say it again, we are just getting started in this space. We have an incredible 5G network with a lot of new spectrum to come in and be dedicated on this 5G capability. And the performance and capabilities are going to continue to expand and improve.\nMike Sievert: And Mike, I think you know our basic game plan here. What's fascinating about this business is we are able to offer it nationwide now across 40 million homes and compete in a relatively even basis in all parts of this country because our go-to-market plan is based on an excess capacity model. And so we aren't dedicating large sums of capital to this business. Instead, our algorithms look at normal mobile usage that's rapidly growing because of the strength of our 5G network and we expect will continue to rapidly grow. We also expect we will continue to take share. We model all that forward and find the pockets where even all those extra customers and all their extra mobile usage won't soak up the capacity of this remarkable network. That's where we approve applicants for 5G home broadband. And so that's really interesting because you have that swallow capacity. And it's just the nature of a mobile network. Our spectrum coverage is relatively consistent and therefore our capacity can be relatively consistent. But mobile usage isn't. Mobile usage is in some places and not others. You have to be everywhere to be competitive. Once you're there, you might as well light up all your spectrum. And so that's really the nature of this. And it allows us to have the economics to be able to go to market with a competitive offer for large swaths of the population and price it attractively and still make a return. Okay; you had a second question about buybacks. I have lost the office pool came in on the third question. So Peter, please tell us what to say.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. Mike, as you said, the momentum of the business gives us a lot of confidence in that opportunity that we expressed around '23 to '25 both the free cash flow generation and the potential for returns. But with regards to timing or starting or opportunity sets, there's really no update from what we shared with you last time that we have to share at this point.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: I'm going to stick in a cheeky 3, if I may. So on fixed wireless broadband, just a follow-up on Mike's question., I'm wondering if you could give us some context on where the ads are coming from and how much of a pull-through you're seeing for fixed wireless broadband customers who weren't previously T-Mobile customers and taking mobile from you? And then you gave us some great color on how market shares are progressing in small markets in the rural. Could you give us an update on what's going on with market share in business and how you guys are tracking towards your objectives there? And then finally, you mentioned monetizing the wireline network. Does that mean selling it? Or you just have excess capacity on the wireline network that you'll then be able to fill up with new wholesale deals?\nMike Sievert: Are you sure you don't want to ask you about top 100 or Sprint integration because that would cover all of the -- okay. Great, Jon, well, let's try to hit those in rapid fire. First on fixed wireless, maybe Mike, you can give us a little color on where the customers are coming from. And then Jon get ready to tell us about small markets and rural areas and what's going on there.\nMichael Katz: Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. As Mike said a second ago, because we're deployed nationally with fixed wireless, really the customers are coming from everywhere. You're seeing customers in top 100 where we are now providing a competitive choice to cable. You're seeing them in Smyrna, where oftentimes we're the only high-speed wireless alternatives in those communities. You're seeing good growth in business. So it's really across the board. And our growth is following the network expansion that Neville just talked about. So as the network expands and we have more capability, we have more sectors with capacity, we'll continue to see growth. All of that combined puts us on a really good trajectory to the 7 million to 8 million customers we talked about in 2025. I think we're in a good pacing to meet that objective.\nMike Sievert: Great. And Jon and Callie, you get ready. And also not only has Jonathan been asking about it but also Roger Entner is asking again about business, what's going on with market share? What kind of customers are we winning? But Jon, small markets in rural areas.\nJon Freier: You bet. So just to remind everybody, smaller markets in rural areas, everything outside of our top 100 market is approximately 40% of the U.S. marketplace. So we started this journey back in 2020 at 13% market share. And we finished at the end of 2021 at 15% market share. So in very short order -- percentage points in smaller markets and rural areas. And what you've seen in Q1 is a plan that's unfolding exactly like we expected which is 40% up on the new accounts that we've established on a year-over-year basis in smaller markets in rural areas. So I'm feeling really good about that, the network expansion, the distribution expansion, bringing that winning formula that we're famous for in the smaller markets and rural areas. We still have a lot of opportunity. When you think about what Neville and his team have done from a 5G coverage perspective, I mean it's just amazing that our 5G coverage geographical footprint in smaller markets and rural areas is more than the combination of AT&T and Verizon. We're 30% larger geographically than AT&T, 4x larger geographically than Verizon. So we're feeling really good about what we're doing there. People need choice in these areas. Of course, when you think about it, I've said this a couple of times, it really is in so many of these places to trip back to the 1990s with just a couple of choices. And when you bring real competition in these spaces, customers are choosing us at rates that we've expected and we're seeing today. What's going on in business?\nCallie Field: All right. Well, listen, we gave ourselves a pretty bold aspiration to be at 20% market share in 2025. And I'll tell you, when share rates today, we're already on track. There's still room to run. We've got strong momentum in the financial sector. We're expanding the number of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for security, for compliance, for their hybrid workforce. Our network performance is a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile in Q1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we launched our first 5G connected cars in the United States with Magenta Drive for BMW. We also launched TIoT in partnership with DT which is a disruptive solution that allows enterprises to access seamless global connectivity. Customers like Biotronic, a leading global medical device company that uses TIoT to monitor their patients all around the world. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of growth of over 200,000 connections in the public sector. One of our new customers is the U.S. Department of Treasury. So we're seeing a lot of growth, really good traction. We've got a lot of work to do. We've got runway ahead of us. We're leveraging our 5G network advantage, enabled already to have active deployments in over 20 trials in advanced network services. So we're very excited about the growth potential that we see there above the plan that we've already stated that we would deliver.\nMike Sievert: One of the things -- reasons I made my joke at the beginning is you were asking about all of our growth objectives. And before we ask Peter to wrap up on wireline, I just want to remind everybody that what you just heard from the team is that we are absolutely on track with the bold aspirations that we shared now more than a year ago with you as we laid out our multiyear plan on this business. And what's interesting about us that makes us so different as a growth bet is that we have a rational, articulated growth strategy based on proven areas of underpenetration where we know we have opportunity and where we are making down payments and are very much on track. And that's what investors should be asking us about. So I just want to make sure everybody is reminded that we have major underpenetrated opportunities in small markets and rural areas, 40% of this country where we've already grown from 13% to 15% share and we're tracking beautifully. We have major underpenetrated segments in business, a huge part of this marketplace and probably growing in the wake of the pandemic where we're very underpenetrated and where Callie just reminded us, our present performance would get us to those multiyear aspirations. We articulated a huge opportunity in high-speed Internet and now 2 quarters in a row have showed you that we're the nation's fastest-growing broadband provider. Our top 100 markets where we lead the industry are also a big opportunity. And you're going to hear us talking more and more about the growth trajectory that we see with prime consumers and quality seekers in the top 100 markets. Despite our leadership, there are tens of millions of people in the top 100 markets who've never given T-Mobile a serious look because they want the best network. Now that we offer that, there's a huge opportunity for us to unlock there and you'll be hearing more about that. And then finally, Sprint integration. I already told you that Sprint integration is a growth tailwind. If Sprint was churning like T-Mobile, we'd be at 900,000 phone net adds this quarter. And we're making the progress that we promised you with one of the biggest sequential churn reductions this industry has ever seen, our best one in 7 years, a whopping 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter, all on the strength of executing like we said we would on a major growth trajectory. So that's one thing I want to make sure to remind people about. And then finally, big question was about wireline, what's going on there? What are the opportunities that we see? What were you really talking about?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. Exactly, Jonathan. So yes, as we see the wind down of the wireless traffic when we shut down the LTE network, that does create capacity on the wireline side. And of course, from a customer perspective, we'll look at what's the right suite of products and services, particularly in the 5G era to serve all their needs. But with the traffic going away, it does create some opportunity for monetization. So we'll rationalize things like buildings. We'll rationalize routes. And there's other things that have become quite valuable now in the form of, for example, IPV4 addresses that with the wireless traffic going away are potentially monetizable for us. So we'll look at the right suite of products and services and monetization opportunities to create the most shareholder value, as you would expect of us.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Terrific. Before we go back to the phones, obviously, we've got questions coming in on Twitter. We usually get interesting ones from Bill Ho. I see one want to hear Neville about network. It looks like we're up again in 5G reach out to 315 million people. Where is that really going? And where are we on ultra-capacity 5G? Can you forecast for us what to expect there because that's the real game.\nNeville Ray: Yes. Love the question, Bill. It's 315 million on our 5G footprint today. I mean, say, the headline, again, 95% of all Americans are covered with T-Mobile's 5G service, more coverage than AT&T and Verizon combined. That's something to sink in. But I love your question is about where do we go from there? I almost want to say we've got to give the competition a chance. We're so far in front. You're asking what happens at the end of '23 and beyond. And of course, we will continue to expand and improve the quality of this network. We've said 300 million people from the 225 million today will be covered with 5G Ultra Capacity. And so that's our end of '23 target. That's way over and above anything that AT&T and Verizon have stated around their ambitions on mid-band rollouts. I think the outer edge there is 250 million. So we're going to be providing way more coverage. But the other piece, Bill, is a lot more spectrum. And so today we have more dedicated 5G spectrum than AT&T and Verizon combined in play. And really, we have just started on that rollout of mid-band and even low-band 5G spectrum. So over the next couple of years, a lot more spectrum coming. The last part of your question was about what's happening with speeds. Are we hitting kind of the 300 to 400 megabit per second speeds that we planned and anticipated. Yes, we are on that mid-band footprint. And that mid-band footprint is going to get bigger and stronger. The lanes are getting wider and faster. We're hitting more and more parts of the country. Many of those opportunities that Mike and Jon just outlined, where we are bringing a massive multi-lane 5G freeway to town. This is going to be an incredibly exciting journey over the next couple of years. And of course, we won't stop there. We'll continue to improve and enhance the network but I don't have any stats to give you above 300 million yet on Ultra Capacity.\nMike Sievert: It's very interesting what's happening here. You've heard us say before that we see that we're 2 years ahead in the 5G race now. And 2 years from now, we'll be 2 years ahead in the 5G race. And that's not a quip, that's not a competitive quip. That's actually an aspiration that we take very serious. And you just heard Neville say that by the end of this year, we'll reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity. That's an aspiration that Verizon has by the end of '24, except only 250 million. But by the end of next year, we'll be at 300 million. And what's interesting is our goal is that in many places, it's not just to have 300 million people deployed but in many places to have fully 200 megahertz of 5G dedicated spectrum. That's remarkable in terms of what we can do to change customers' experiences on smartphones, to serve enterprises, government customers and, of course, broadband and other new applications. And so that's our aspiration. We take it very seriously. And one of the things you should judge us on is, have we been through over and over and over again to the things that we said we would go do. Because we've been very clear-eyed about this strategy for many years and I think that consistency is something that people should acknowledge.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: I'm going to stay with this topic of rural markets for a minute. You've talked about this being 40% of the country. And I think last quarter, you gave some interesting color on how you can even further segment that 40% of the country into areas where you've already introduced retail stores and presumably come in behind low-frequency spectrum with some mid-band filling in some of the denser areas of those otherwise non-dense markets. Could you just sort of talk about the segments within the 40%? Sort of how much is left that is sort of truly greenfield, I guess, in the sense that you really haven't gotten there yet with a real retail presence? And where even that 15% market share that you talked about may be quite a bit lower? And then in the areas that are a little more mature within the 40%, what that looks like?\nMike Sievert: Absolutely. I'll start and then I'll ask Jon Freier to jump in and maybe Neville as well. I'll remind you of a couple of things that we've said in the past and something I said in my prepared remarks. What we do for this 40% of the country, we call it our precision playbook. We've divided that segment of the country into 775 submarkets. And what we do is study our relative competitiveness. And so it starts with the network. Is our network every place people in that local area need for us to believe that we have all the factors of success required to win market share. Now this is observable because we are number one in many places in this country. We know what it takes. And we take that same observable logic and we apply it now to places we were never highly competitive. And what we've said in our upfront remarks is that we believe we are competitive across about 30% of those places, the POPs represented by those places. And that will be competitive across about 50% by the end of this year. Now, I'll guide you. There are some layers of competitiveness. That's sort of our base level and above. And there's levels that we can get to above that. But we measure that number because what we see is when we have that level of competitiveness, what we call right to win, we are able to see win shares in line with our aspirations such that we know that the price that we promised you is within reach. And that's really important. So again, we're in those 30% of POPs where we already have a right to win, we are winning. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in this strategy. We'll be at 50% by the end of this year. And maybe, Jon, you can talk about what's going on as we enter each of these markets, what formula we bring to make sure that we get the win share that's required for us to grow our market share.\nJon Freier: You bet. So that's what Mike just said in terms of really staying focused on this overall cocktail and proven recipe of success when you think about network readiness, distribution entry and then really bringing this differentiated localized marketing to the markets to go in and drive choice and consideration of some of those things. The other thing, too, that I don't think I've mentioned is that we took an opportunity last year to reorganize a huge portion of our company around smaller markets and rural areas. So I've got teams all across the country that are focused on the top 100 markets and exclusively on the top 100 markets. So you think about right here in New York City, L.A., Chicago, Dallas, those teams are focused on those markets. And then also we took a big portion of our team and focused them on smaller markets in rural areas. So for example, if you're in Washington State, we got a team that's focused on greater Seattle, Tacoma and then another team that's focused on rural Washington state, driving the commercial success that we're looking for in those particular areas. And what we've seen is that when you focus teams and give them the kinds of tools that they need to go drive the commercial success we're looking for and all of the accountability, we're beginning to see real traction around that. And what that does, too, is it creates an overall kind of feedback loop and listening system within our company so that we can go and take further action where we have more network that we need to really kind of dial in, in a particular area. If we need more marketing in a particular area, the network is really good but we need a little bit more investment from a market perspective, we get that real feedback. When you have a team that's focused on a total geography, including the top 100 markets, almost always the top 100 markets take that focus because of the tonnage of the population in those areas and on the established muscle memory. And so that's a big part of our formula that we are executing today that we put into place last year and something that's proven to be really successful. And like we talked about, too, when you look at this accelerated build-out of what's coming, thanks to Neville and his team, with not only extended range 5G but that Ultra Capacity 5G and the majority of the growth that's going to be happening in terms of covered POPs, it's going to be in smaller markets and rural areas, that's one more big reason why we need to be organized the way that we are to drive the playbook that we've laid out for you.\nMike Sievert: A lot of times, our breakthroughs come from willingness to lead things in an unconventional way like with team of experts a few years ago and Jon just told you about another big breakthrough management concept that we've fully implemented across the country that we think is a big part of our, I guess, now not so secret sauce. Great. And by the way, so before we go back to the phones, Neville back to you. There's a question from Tech Life Channel, Techlife32, What's going on with those 10,000 new sites because 5G coverage is great but what about coverage? So what's happening with our promised site expansion? And while you're at, we did say in our prepared remarks where we are on decommissioning. This is the year of decommissioning. We expect to complete the task this year. Maybe you can give an update on how that's going, too.\nNeville Ray: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. And let me build on both your and Jon's comments on SMRA. I mean back to the last call, our last earnings call, we talked about how this was the year where we were accelerating capital and we were bringing in incremental investment into the plan in '22. And the big, big chunk, lion's share of that is focused on expansion of our coverage and our footprint. And so a big part of what we're doing is making sure as Jon is getting ready to roll in distribution and new capabilities into the smaller market and rural areas, we're making sure our coverage is second to none. On top of the coverage, of course, Jon referenced this, we're adding this mid-band capability. So that we don't just have a great network, we have an incredibly strong network with 5G capabilities that our competition simply can't match. And just to navigate through some of the stats we talked about earlier on, in many of these small markets and rural areas, AT&T and Verizon have no plans whatsoever to bring mid-band capability in 5G. So we're going in, putting in a very differentiated proposition and one that will stand the test of time. And so that share gain is getting started and moving. It's a super exciting space. So we've always said 10,000 new sites is part of the plan as we combine the sets of assets together. And we're eating into that in 2022. We're a couple of thousand in and we'll be continuing to build as we move through this year and next. We're also upgrading a lot of Sprint sites that are critical to enhancing coverage and performance across the network. So we've always said north of 10,000 of those. We're about 1/3 of the way through that build. And so we're adding coverage in many, many dimensions, both in SMRA but also in core market areas. And inside top 100, too, where we're adding great sites for capacity in building all of those different aspects of performance. And last but not least, Mike asked about reference decom. And so this is the year where we will complete all of the decom that we said we would do as part of combining Sprint and T-Mobile together. And we announced in the release, we're about 1/3 of the way through at the end of Q1 on the 35,000-site decom ambition. And that number is accelerated and it will accelerate heavily as we go through Q2 and Q3. We want to get the lion's share of that done earlier in the year, this isn't all going to happen in Q4 and we're making great progress and, I'd add, as we see declining churn. And so the work and the intense work across the entire business to manage the customer experience as we navigate and work through decom is extraordinary and going very well. And we're incredibly confident about our ability to execute and complete this integration in advance of the time frames that we talked about prior.\nMike Sievert: Neville and his team are very busy. This is, as you know, the peak capital year in our business plan. And we have teams that are upgrading literally hundreds and hundreds of sites every single week. In a year, we're going to simultaneously reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G while completing the shutdown of the Sprint network well and ahead of our schedule. So it's a -- and we're very much on track. And it's fantastic to see the team's execution in every part of this country.\nOperator: So next, we'll go to Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: And this is actually sort of a follow-up to what you guys were just discussing. So we look at your results for the first quarter and your cost of service, excluding merger-related costs, actually downticked a bit despite the fact that you had, I think, a new tower lease in place, despite the fact that you still had the CDMA network up and running, I think, for essentially the entire quarter. And as Neville just pointed out, you still have the large majority of the decommissioning in front of you but of course you're also still investing. So I guess the question really would be, how should we think about the opportunity and the pace of further improvements in that cost item throughout the remainder of the year? And maybe at what point would we expect to see the full synergy benefit of having completed the network projects in your cost of service line item? And then just a second question. The comments you made before about the excess Sprint churn and how it affected your postpaid phone net adds. It sounds like that headwind has diminished a bit from what we saw in the second half of the year. I'm wondering if that's a signal that we are indeed through the peak pressure associated with that. And then just as an update on that, if you can give us some insight as to what the churn profile that legacy Sprint cohort looks like as they continue to make the migration fully over to T-Mobile.\nMike Sievert: Great. I'll start with the second one and then hand it to Peter on the first one. We are delighted with what we're seeing this year on Sprint customer response to everything happening on the network and service and plan front; and you can see it in our results. So one of the things we -- I mentioned a little while ago is that right now, we're substantially complete with about 37% of the customers, bringing them what I'll call all the way across. Now the vast majority of our customers are on the T-Mobile network now, almost all their traffic is on the T-Mobile network now. We'll be moving to shut down the Sprint network this year. But we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the customers come across with T-Mobile plans, T-Mobile phone plans, no remaining leases on their line and all of their traffic on the T-Mobile side. When those things happen, churn is the same. And we have achieved that milestone now for about 37% of the Sprint base. And that's much higher than it was just a few months ago. And so you see the result in the sequential churn improvement because as more and more people achieve that level, more and more of them churn just like T-Mobile churn was. And that's what unfolded over the last quarter. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in our plan. I want to make sure that people don't connect it though to something happening just 2 months from now. I mean when we shut down the Sprint network, it's not just the network traffic. The network traffic is already on T-Mobile. It's the whole thing, getting them migrated to the right plan, the right service structure and, importantly, getting them on a T-Mobile phone payment plan and making sure there's no more leases because those are sources of dissatisfaction. And that's where we're at 37%. It will take us some time to stepwise move through the base. But what we know is that when we do, they love T-Mobile on the other hand and they churn like the lowest-churning brand over the last 2 years. And so that's fantastic. And then specifically to your first question, we'll turn it to Peter on the cost of services.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, Brett, absolutely. And you are seeing great scale, just as we promised it would unfold on cost of services. As you think about this year and the shaping, of course as you mentioned in Q2, you'll continue to have rapid investments as Neville and team continue to build these new sites, rebuild Sprint sites, while we'll continue to still have Sprint LTE cost. So as I think about the year shaping, it's very much in line with the synergy commentary that I gave, that as we go through the rapid decommissioning and accelerated decommissioning and get through all of that by the end of the year, you'll see those benefits come out in cost of services. In totality, of course, we're looking at 2024 to achieve the full $7.5 billion of run rate savings. So that's how I think about the shaping for the balance of the year.\nMike Sievert: It's nice to see things unfolding the way we predicted. We're very much on track for the $7.5 billion. We increased the in-year synergy attainment with this guidance. And of course, that results in also an increase in cash flows to 30% year-over-year cash flows in the present guidance. So terrific to see that happening. Listen, we promised you a 1-hour call. And so with apologies to those still in the queue, many of whom I'm really sorry we didn't get to because we love you but we'll take the last question, operator.\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go next to Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: So great to hear the updated guidance on the net adds. If you look at the first quarter, it looks like the industry is probably going to do close to 2 million phone adds and there's been this concern about a deceleration in the industry growth. So it'd be great to get some perspective about what you're seeing and how you feel confident about not just your growth but also that the industry can sustain these sort of 8 million, 9 million type ad numbers that's sort of implied by what we've seen from the others so far? And then just, Neville, anything to comment on supply chain availability of tower crews et cetera, given again some of the macro constraints we're seeing?\nMike Sievert: Let me start with Neville and supply chain and then I'll wrap things up with an answer to your question, Simon.\nNeville Ray: I'll be very quick, Simon. I mean we're in good shape. And based on the arrangements that we put in place with our OEMs and our tower crews. And of course, we have the advantage, we've been at this for some time now, whereas our competition is really just trying to get started, especially in AT&T's case. So we're strong. Obviously, we are not sitting on our hands and we are very, very closely managing supply chain. Our position does not come from inaction and just letting it happen. We're very engaged with all of our suppliers across the U.S. and both internationally. And right now, we're in good shape. And you can see in terms of the performance and growth on the network and the investments we're making.\nMike Sievert: Simon, I'm glad you asked that because your question goes -- in my mind, it goes right to the heart of what a lot of people want to know about this sector right now. And I would characterize it really in terms of 2 important questions people have. One, is there room for everybody? What's going -- can this growth continue? What's going to go on when the growth slows down? And if it slows down, will it get unhealthily competitive? Those are the big questions, I think, on people's minds. And I got to tell you, I'm not concerned about those questions. As I've said in the past, first of all, I think what we're seeing is some of that is happening in the dynamic right now out there. And in the very time frame when people are asking these questions, they're asking, \"Hey, how are you going to navigate if things slow down?\" We delivered 1.3 million postpaid net adds, the best in 8 years, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. In the very time frame when people are saying, what about are things slowing down? How are you guys going to do if things slow down? And I love that you're asking that because it reminds everyone listening that this is a business with major underpenetrated growth opportunities that we are proving we know how to execute against. And that's why we reliably bring the performance quarter after quarter. And to the second question people have which is, isn't it going to get crazy out there if there isn't room for everybody? Which is I don't know but I can tell you that the amount of competitiveness that we bring is consistent over time. We are the competition. We like it competitive. It's been relatively consistently competitive through our actions for years now. Customers and businesses are the beneficiaries. Right now, the cost per unit in this industry is lower for consumers and businesses than it's ever been, in a time when every other category has rising prices. We're driving ARPU improvements without price improvement. And we're bringing a level of competitiveness to this industry that's so exciting for consumers and businesses while delivering on financial performance that we promised you and then some. And so people have these 2 questions. Is there room for everybody? I don't know. That's not -- I'm not burdened with that. I can tell you that this quarter it looks like there is. Cables about to report, I think they had a healthy quarter. We're going to see nice numbers there. Our telemetry has usually been pretty good at predicting what to see there. But we delivered an 8-year Q1 all-time almost high. And that shows you that our growth strategy has integrity and it's reliable, safe, quarter-after-quarter growth that comes in just like we promised you it would. And it comes in with a healthy industry and a dynamic where T-Mobile can achieve its cash flow aspirations. And so look, we like it. We look at the industry. We know we play an important role as stewards of a healthy industry and we think it's a healthy industry. And whether or not it's a healthy industry, it's going to be an industry that's healthy for T-Mobile. So you got to think that in all the time that you have, we really appreciate you. Thanks for coming quarter after quarter with your great discussions. And we look forward to engaging with you more. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile first quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. As you can see, we started off 2022 with very strong Q1 results. Our industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and highest postpaid phone ARPU growth in the last 5 years resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 9% year-over-year. That strong service revenue growth, combined with our continued execution on our merger synergies, delivered year-over-year core adjusted EBITDA growth of 10% compared to the year-over-year decline in EBITDA that you see from others in our industry. That growth and profitability fueled higher operating cash flow even with higher merger-related costs and enabled us to deliver industry-leading growth in free cash flow of over 25% while accelerating our CapEx investments in the network. So let's talk about how our great execution in Q1 set us up to raise guidance across the board for 2022. We now expect total postpaid net additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.8 million, up 300,000 at the midpoint, reflecting our ongoing focus on profitable growth with our Magenta brand as we continue our accelerated Sprint customer migration. We continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year more weighted to the second half, with the Sprint migration impacts more in the first half and expansion in smaller markets and rural areas building throughout the year. Consistent with Q1, this net adds guidance does not include the small subset of customers who will not migrate upon the sunset of the Sprint networks which will be treated as a base adjustment. As we began the CDMA sunset at the end of Q1, we took an adjustment of 212,000 postpaid phones, in line with what we had guided, as well as 349,000 postpaid other devices which were largely low ARPU IoT devices. We expect to begin the LTE sunset at the end of Q2 and estimate a base adjustment of approximately 300,000 postpaid phones and between 700,000 and 900,000 lower ARPU postpaid other devices. The anticipated impact of these adjustments is relatively immaterial and fully incorporated into our core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow guidance. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We now expect full year 2022 to be between $25.8 billion and $26.2 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $150 million from the prior guidance, driven by our growth in service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues which we continue to expect to be between $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion as we transition Sprint customers off device leasing. We now expect merger synergies to be between $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and weighted to the second half of the year, primarily as we unlock more network savings as site decommissioning accelerates. As a result of timing of synergies within the year, the impacts from the Sprint network onset and an expected slight sequential decline in wholesale revenue, we expect core adjusted EBITDA in Q2 to be similar to Q1 and then higher in the second half. Merger-related costs not included in core adjusted EBITDA are still expected to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion before taxes, primarily representing network activities. We expect slightly over 1/3 of the total to occur in Q2 and then taper off in the second half of the year as merger-related costs precede synergy realization. Net cash provided by operating activities, including payments for merger-related costs, is now expected to be in the range of $15.7 billion to $16.1 billion, up more than 10% year-over-year at the midpoint which is up $100 million from the prior guidance. With the robust pace of our 5G deployment and network integration, we now expect cash CapEx to be between $13.2 billion and $13.5 billion which is up $100 million at the midpoint as we capitalize on growth opportunities and enhance the customer network experience. Together, we now expect free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion which we raised $50 million at the midpoint. This is up more than 30% over last year even with the higher levels of investment and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And additionally, as we execute our strategy to continuously deepen our cap relationships, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up 2%. As Mike also mentioned, we expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up approximately 1% for the full year, driven by continued customer adoption of value-add services, including Magenta MAX. And finally, with the shutdown of the Sprint CDMA and LTE networks, certain wireline assets acquired in the merger will no longer support the wireless business, triggering an impairment analysis. As a result of the wireless network shutdown, we anticipate a noncash impairment charge in the range of $400 million to $500 million in Q2. The cessation of wireless traffic also enables monetization of certain wireless assets to the wireline assets which were previously supporting the wireless traffic. Any cash monetization of these wireline assets would be recorded as gains in future periods if they occur. Altogether, we see 2022 as another year of profitable growth and free cash flow expansion as we continue to invest in our network and the business. What I find most exciting is our unique opportunity to unlock significant free cash flow by delivering industry-leading growth in customers, service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to Jud to begin Q&A. Yes, absolutely. Mike, as you said, the momentum of the business gives us a lot of confidence in that opportunity that we expressed around '23 to '25 both the free cash flow generation and the potential for returns. But with regards to timing or starting or opportunity sets, there's really no update from what we shared with you last time that we have to share at this point. Yes. Exactly, Jonathan. So yes, as we see the wind down of the wireless traffic when we shut down the LTE network, that does create capacity on the wireline side. And of course, from a customer perspective, we'll look at what's the right suite of products and services, particularly in the 5G era to serve all their needs. But with the traffic going away, it does create some opportunity for monetization. So we'll rationalize things like buildings. We'll rationalize routes. And there's other things that have become quite valuable now in the form of, for example, IPV4 addresses that with the wireless traffic going away are potentially monetizable for us. So we'll look at the right suite of products and services and monetization opportunities to create the most shareholder value, as you would expect of us. Yes, Brett, absolutely. And you are seeing great scale, just as we promised it would unfold on cost of services. As you think about this year and the shaping, of course as you mentioned in Q2, you'll continue to have rapid investments as Neville and team continue to build these new sites, rebuild Sprint sites, while we'll continue to still have Sprint LTE cost. So as I think about the year shaping, it's very much in line with the synergy commentary that I gave, that as we go through the rapid decommissioning and accelerated decommissioning and get through all of that by the end of the year, you'll see those benefits come out in cost of services. In totality, of course, we're looking at 2024 to achieve the full $7.5 billion of run rate savings. So that's how I think about the shaping for the balance of the year."

            "name": "Jon Freier",
            "content": "Yes, you bet. John, yes, we're not seeing any of that. What we're seeing is a great Q1, as we've reported, with 348,000 postpaid net accounts and 1.3 million total postpaid. And when you look at what we're seeing in March and April, we're actually seeing the seasonal benefits that you would expect and actually switching and improving on a year-over-year basis. Remember, in Q1 of last year, that was the depth of the pandemic when people were kitty baring the door back in January and February of last year. And today, we're seeing the overall switching activity continuing to improve on a year-over-year basis. So when I look at traffic and I look at all the activity in the marketplace, I'm feeling really, really confident about what we're seeing. You bet. So just to remind everybody, smaller markets in rural areas, everything outside of our top 100 market is approximately 40% of the U.S. marketplace. So we started this journey back in 2020 at 13% market share. And we finished at the end of 2021 at 15% market share. So in very short order -- percentage points in smaller markets and rural areas. And what you've seen in Q1 is a plan that's unfolding exactly like we expected which is 40% up on the new accounts that we've established on a year-over-year basis in smaller markets in rural areas. So I'm feeling really good about that, the network expansion, the distribution expansion, bringing that winning formula that we're famous for in the smaller markets and rural areas. We still have a lot of opportunity. When you think about what Neville and his team have done from a 5G coverage perspective, I mean it's just amazing that our 5G coverage geographical footprint in smaller markets and rural areas is more than the combination of AT&T and Verizon. We're 30% larger geographically than AT&T, 4x larger geographically than Verizon. So we're feeling really good about what we're doing there. People need choice in these areas. Of course, when you think about it, I've said this a couple of times, it really is in so many of these places to trip back to the 1990s with just a couple of choices. And when you bring real competition in these spaces, customers are choosing us at rates that we've expected and we're seeing today. What's going on in business? You bet. So that's what Mike just said in terms of really staying focused on this overall cocktail and proven recipe of success when you think about network readiness, distribution entry and then really bringing this differentiated localized marketing to the markets to go in and drive choice and consideration of some of those things. The other thing, too, that I don't think I've mentioned is that we took an opportunity last year to reorganize a huge portion of our company around smaller markets and rural areas. So I've got teams all across the country that are focused on the top 100 markets and exclusively on the top 100 markets. So you think about right here in New York City, L.A., Chicago, Dallas, those teams are focused on those markets. And then also we took a big portion of our team and focused them on smaller markets in rural areas. So for example, if you're in Washington State, we got a team that's focused on greater Seattle, Tacoma and then another team that's focused on rural Washington state, driving the commercial success that we're looking for in those particular areas. And what we've seen is that when you focus teams and give them the kinds of tools that they need to go drive the commercial success we're looking for and all of the accountability, we're beginning to see real traction around that. And what that does, too, is it creates an overall kind of feedback loop and listening system within our company so that we can go and take further action where we have more network that we need to really kind of dial in, in a particular area. If we need more marketing in a particular area, the network is really good but we need a little bit more investment from a market perspective, we get that real feedback. When you have a team that's focused on a total geography, including the top 100 markets, almost always the top 100 markets take that focus because of the tonnage of the population in those areas and on the established muscle memory. And so that's a big part of our formula that we are executing today that we put into place last year and something that's proven to be really successful. And like we talked about, too, when you look at this accelerated build-out of what's coming, thanks to Neville and his team, with not only extended range 5G but that Ultra Capacity 5G and the majority of the growth that's going to be happening in terms of covered POPs, it's going to be in smaller markets and rural areas, that's one more big reason why we need to be organized the way that we are to drive the playbook that we've laid out for you."

            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Mike. As Mike said, we reached an agreement with DISH. We're waiting for the approval from DOJ. But both companies are operating as if the deal is in place and that partnership has been going really well for us. A couple of things that we talked about last quarter that you've seen come to fruition this quarter. One is we reached a wind-down agreement with TracFone and you're seeing that roll through our numbers. We also reached agreements with -- extension agreements with Google which is a large exclusive scaled MVNO that's in our portfolio. And a new MVNO agreement with Altice. So we're seeing new and expanded MVNO relationships in our portfolio. And we're seeing a lot of interest and a lot of growth from the existing companies in the portfolio taking advantage of the network capacity and the network capabilities. So it's a -- wholesale has been a really strong portfolio for us. Yes. Thanks, Jonathan. As Mike said a second ago, because we're deployed nationally with fixed wireless, really the customers are coming from everywhere. You're seeing customers in top 100 where we are now providing a competitive choice to cable. You're seeing them in Smyrna, where oftentimes we're the only high-speed wireless alternatives in those communities. You're seeing good growth in business. So it's really across the board. And our growth is following the network expansion that Neville just talked about. So as the network expands and we have more capability, we have more sectors with capacity, we'll continue to see growth. All of that combined puts us on a really good trajectory to the 7 million to 8 million customers we talked about in 2025. I think we're in a good pacing to meet that objective."

There's still room to run. We've got strong momentum in the financial sector. We're expanding the number of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for security, for compliance, for their hybrid workforce. Our network performance is a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile in Q1. As Mike mentioned earlier, we launched our first 5G connected cars in the United States with Magenta Drive for BMW. We also launched TIoT in partnership with DT which is a disruptive solution that allows enterprises to access seamless global connectivity. Customers like Biotronic, a leading global medical device company that uses TIoT to monitor their patients all around the world. This was the ninth consecutive quarter of growth of over 200,000 connections in the public sector. One of our new customers is the U.S. Department of Treasury. So we're seeing a lot of growth, really good traction. We've got a lot of work to do. We've got runway ahead of us. We're leveraging our 5G network advantage, enabled already to have active deployments in over 20 trials in advanced network services.

            "name": "Neville Ray",
            "content": "Yes. I mean they're great stats, right, when you look at how we are performing and competing in this broadband space. I think everybody said, what happens with 5G? Well, look at what we're doing with this in-home broadband experience. And 1 million customers now, 1 million, our first 1 million, the first 1 million. And so it's coming from just the powerhouse network we have. And I like to say we're just getting started on this 5G story. We're adding a lot of coverage. We're adding a lot of spectrum. And the sheer horsepower that we can provide off this 5G network allows us to support this great and increasing and improving experience. So we're super proud about the performance we have. Customers are really enjoying this product. And to be honest, I'll say it again, we are just getting started in this space. We have an incredible 5G network with a lot of new spectrum to come in and be dedicated on this 5G capability. And the performance and capabilities are going to continue to expand and improve. Yes. Love the question, Bill. It's 315 million on our 5G footprint today. I mean, say, the headline, again, 95% of all Americans are covered with T-Mobile's 5G service, more coverage than AT&T and Verizon combined. That's something to sink in. But I love your question is about where do we go from there? I almost want to say we've got to give the competition a chance. We're so far in front. You're asking what happens at the end of '23 and beyond. And of course, we will continue to expand and improve the quality of this network. We've said 300 million people from the 225 million today will be covered with 5G Ultra Capacity. And so that's our end of '23 target. That's way over and above anything that AT&T and Verizon have stated around their ambitions on mid-band rollouts. I think the outer edge there is 250 million. So we're going to be providing way more coverage. But the other piece, Bill, is a lot more spectrum. And so today we have more dedicated 5G spectrum than AT&T and Verizon combined in play. And really, we have just started on that rollout of mid-band and even low-band 5G spectrum. So over the next couple of years, a lot more spectrum coming. The last part of your question was about what's happening with speeds. Are we hitting kind of the 300 to 400 megabit per second speeds that we planned and anticipated. Yes, we are on that mid-band footprint. And that mid-band footprint is going to get bigger and stronger. The lanes are getting wider and faster. We're hitting more and more parts of the country. Many of those opportunities that Mike and Jon just outlined, where we are bringing a massive multi-lane 5G freeway to town. This is going to be an incredibly exciting journey over the next couple of years. And of course, we won't stop there. We'll continue to improve and enhance the network but I don't have any stats to give you above 300 million yet on Ultra Capacity. Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. And let me build on both your and Jon's comments on SMRA. I mean back to the last call, our last earnings call, we talked about how this was the year where we were accelerating capital and we were bringing in incremental investment into the plan in '22. And the big, big chunk, lion's share of that is focused on expansion of our coverage and our footprint. And so a big part of what we're doing is making sure as Jon is getting ready to roll in distribution and new capabilities into the smaller market and rural areas, we're making sure our coverage is second to none. On top of the coverage, of course, Jon referenced this, we're adding this mid-band capability. So that we don't just have a great network, we have an incredibly strong network with 5G capabilities that our competition simply can't match. And just to navigate through some of the stats we talked about earlier on, in many of these small markets and rural areas, AT&T and Verizon have no plans whatsoever to bring mid-band capability in 5G. So we're going in, putting in a very differentiated proposition and one that will stand the test of time. And so that share gain is getting started and moving. It's a super exciting space. So we've always said 10,000 new sites is part of the plan as we combine the sets of assets together. And we're eating into that in 2022. We're a couple of thousand in and we'll be continuing to build as we move through this year and next. We're also upgrading a lot of Sprint sites that are critical to enhancing coverage and performance across the network. So we've always said north of 10,000 of those. We're about 1/3 of the way through that build. And so we're adding coverage in many, many dimensions, both in SMRA but also in core market areas. And inside top 100, too, where we're adding great sites for capacity in building all of those different aspects of performance. And last but not least, Mike asked about reference decom. And so this is the year where we will complete all of the decom that we said we would do as part of combining Sprint and T-Mobile together. And we announced in the release, we're about 1/3 of the way through at the end of Q1 on the 35,000-site decom ambition. And that number is accelerated and it will accelerate heavily as we go through Q2 and Q3. We want to get the lion's share of that done earlier in the year, this isn't all going to happen in Q4 and we're making great progress and, I'd add, as we see declining churn. And so the work and the intense work across the entire business to manage the customer experience as we navigate and work through decom is extraordinary and going very well. And we're incredibly confident about our ability to execute and complete this integration in advance of the time frames that we talked about prior. I'll be very quick, Simon. I mean we're in good shape. And based on the arrangements that we put in place with our OEMs and our tower crews. And of course, we have the advantage, we've been at this for some time now, whereas our competition is really just trying to get started, especially in AT&T's case. So we're strong. Obviously, we are not sitting on our hands and we are very, very closely managing supply chain. Our position does not come from inaction and just letting it happen. We're very engaged with all of our suppliers across the U.S. and both internationally. And right now, we're in good shape. And you can see in terms of the performance and growth on the network and the investments we're making."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, what an exciting time right now at T-Mobile. We have a lot to cover but we'll keep our comments brief this time so that we can get right to your questions. We just celebrated the 2-year anniversary of this merger. We delivered another exciting outperformance in Q1 to kick off 2022. We're in the home stretch of our accelerated integration. And we're raising our guidance for the year across the board based on the momentum that we see in our business. It's hard to believe that it's already been 2 years since we closed our merger with Sprint. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished as we have consistently exceeded not only our own targets but also Wall Street's expectations. One of the cornerstones of our merger advocacy was that we would lead the U.S. into the 5G era. And I don't think very many people anticipated what we've already achieved in just 2 years. We now cover 315 million people with 5G. That's 95% of all Americans. And our 5G geographic coverage with dedicated low-band spectrum is more than Verizon and AT&T have combined which both, by the way, are still largely sharing spectrum with their LTE networks. Perhaps our greatest impact though was to awaken the industry to the transformational performance of mid-band spectrum for Ultra Capacity 5G. We already cover 225 million Americans and nearly 85% of all T-Mobile customers with these game-changing experiences. We caused others to pivot from an apparent willingness to leave fast 5G to a select few customers within arm's reach of a millimeter wave site. And now we see them greatly increasing their investments in mid-band spectrum and deployment. They are trying to chase us but only to realize they will be and are years behind T-Mobile. Pre-merger, we laid out a plan to realize massive synergies from our scale and efficiencies only to raise our run rate synergy expectations by 25% after closing the merger. We're delivering these synergies bigger and faster than expected to the benefit of our shareholders. And synergies are ramping up even further this year as we're approaching some of our biggest milestones, including moving the remaining customers off the Sprint network in the next couple of month just over 2 years from merger close. And we're also on track to upgrade or decommission substantially all of the Sprint sites this year, less than 3 years from close. We've been selectively decommissioning sites since the merger close. And as of Q1, we've decommissioned roughly 1/3 of the 35,000 targeted sites, with the big push coming in the second half of this year. Remarkable execution by the team as we pulled these milestones forward by more than a year. At the Un-carrier, we're committed to use our 5G leadership and synergies for the good of consumers and businesses, eliminating the biggest pain point in this industry where customers were forced to make trade-offs between network quality and value. As the only national wireless provider with a clearly articulated and differentiated growth strategy, we have led the industry in postpaid customer and service revenue growth in the 2 years since the merger closed. In that time, we've delivered roughly 2 million postpaid account net adds and 11.5 million postpaid net adds, including an industry-best 5.3 million postpaid phone net adds. We were also the only national wireless operator to deliver double-digit growth in both service revenue and core adjusted EBITDA over that period. And we accomplished this while building the foundation for sustainable growth platforms across enterprise and government, smaller markets in rural areas, prime consumers in the largest 100 markets and bringing real competition to broadband. We've unlocked new experiences for consumers, like the first truly unlimited 5G plan with Magenta MAX. And we've established T-Mobile as the fastest-growing broadband provider, bringing a better product and value proposition to over 40 million potential households and already serving over 1 million customers, just a year after our commercial launch. We are carrying this momentum right into 2022, delivering another industry-leading quarter of both customer and financial growth in Q1 built on the incredible momentum of our Magenta brand. We added 348,000 postpaid account net adds, our highest Q1 ever and the highest reported in the industry yet again. As I've said before, this measure of our total billing relationships is the best barometer that we're winning the switching decisions in this industry. While others appear to be leaning into adding lines to their base, we are focused on growing the number of customer relationships and then deepening them over time across our products and services. And we delivered our highest Q1 postpaid net adds in 8 years with an industry best 1.3 million. That's more postpaid nets than AT&T and Verizon combined. This includes 589,000 postpaid phone net adds. Our postpaid phone churn dropped by a whopping 17 basis points from Q4 to just 0.93, the industry best improvement both year-over-year and sequentially. We were the only national wireless operator to improve churn year-over-year as our competitors saw their churn increase. This integration-driven churn improvement really matters because our phone gross adds were the highest in the industry yet again in Q1. In fact, if the Sprint churn was the same as the Magenta churn, postpaid phone net adds in Q1 would have been closer to 900,000. And I couldn't be more excited about high-speed Internet, where we had 338,000 net adds and I expect will be the fastest-growing broadband provider in the industry for the second consecutive quarter. Demand just continues to build from dissatisfied suburban cable customers to underserved customers in smaller markets and rural areas. Our Net Promoter Scores continue to improve quarter-over-quarter and, are now more than 3x the average NPS scores for cable customers. The best part is we're just getting started bringing the Un-carrier to broadband. So stay tuned for what we have in store next. Magenta MAX continues to see great adoption from customers which is helping to drive strong ARPU and ARPA trends and we still have lots of room for further growth. With the trends that we're seeing, we now expect postpaid phone ARPU to be up roughly 1% in 2022. In addition, we continue to see our prime mix of credit apps increased on a year-over-year basis each quarter, showing that our network and our brand are consistently attracting the industry's best customers. We continue to see good momentum in smaller markets and rural areas as we expand the reach of our distribution and network. The team is executing our precision playbook here to a T, coordinating the network and distribution build-outs to unlock new experiences community by community. We ended 2021 effectively competing in about 30% of households in these markets and will continue to expand to more than half of households in smaller markets by the end of this year. Our new accounts from smaller markets and rural areas grew 40% year-over-year in Q1. And these markets are also a great example of where our high-speed Internet is helping to open doors for us to drive mobile penetration. T-Mobile for Business continues to build mind share with enterprise and government customers on the strength of our network and our ever-expanding suite of products and services. We've built strong momentum across major verticals now, such as the financial sector, where we continue to expand the list of large multinational banks relying on T-Mobile for secure and compliant connectivity for their hybrid mobile workforce. Our network performance has also been a catalyst for over 31st responder agencies to join T-Mobile just in Q1. We recently introduced the first 5G connected cars in America with Magenta Drive for BMW. And we continue to be on the leading edge of advanced 5G network solutions like mobile edge compute and private networks. I'm excited about building on our momentum with businesses in 2022 with our significant and durable 5G network advantage. Okay, let me wrap up. It's been a remarkable run in the first 2 years since our merger. We've unlocked better experiences for consumers and businesses by offering the best value and the promise of the best network for the first time in this industry's history. We've unlocked shareholder value through industry-leading growth in postpaid customers and service revenues while delivering merger synergies bigger and faster than originally planned. We're off to a great start in 2022 with a beat-and-raise quarter that not only led this industry in growth of postpaid customers but also service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and cash flows. And positioned us to raise our guidance across the board just 1 quarter into the year. Our team is excited to carry all this momentum through the rest of '22 and I'll let Peter take you through our key financial highlights from Q1 and our increased guidance in more detail. Peter? We've heard some of that, too, John and not really but I'll let Jon give you a little color on what we're seeing in retail and as we engage with the consumer. And then I'll come back and talk about inflation. You can see that in both of our competitors having elevated churn in Q1 relative to the year ago period. It wasn't the case for us. Our churn is unfolding exactly as we've told you it would. It's driven by merger integration synergies. And we've achieved some really important milestones here on merger integration to where if you think about the customers that have transitioned, Sprint customers that are on the T-Mobile network, with all their traffic predominantly on T-Mobile, who have T-Mobile plans and T-Mobile device plans, those customers are the ones we've been telling you about the churn just like Magenta customers. And those are now 37% of our base. So we brought a substantial minority across. And that was a big factor in driving a whopping 17 basis point sequential churn improvement in just 1 quarter, exactly unfolding the way we told you it would. There's a lot of work left lot to do, obviously. 37% isn't 100%. That's going to take us some time. But it shows you that the thesis that we've been sharing is unfolding exactly as predicted. Now as it relates to inflation, I'm not sure what you're getting at but I'll talk about 2 things here, John. One is from a cost structure standpoint, as we've said in the past, our sector is actually somewhat insulated. Obviously, we need to watch labor costs and variable costs but the vast bulk of our cost structure is in long-term contracts around things like tower contracts, backhaul contracts, technology contracts, those kinds of things that are generally fixed and finite and known over a multiyear period which gives us some insulation from inflation effects. I think the larger question facing our society is what will be the impact of inflation beyond consumers? And the answer is we don't know. Right now, there's a lot of consumer anxiety about inflation. And customers have stressed out budget. What we know is that T-Mobile is famous for being the value leader. We can save a family of 4 on postpaid $900 a year, a year, every year, from switching to T-Mobile. And so as -- we'll have to watch what happens with consumer sentiment here but if it is a difficult time, there's a real opportunity for us to stand up and serve more and more people as the value leader and we'll, of course, be ready to do that. I'll start by saying our envelope of value leadership has been remarkably consistent over time. And so if you look at a multiyear arc, we offer the best value to postpaid consumers. That has been the case for the entire Un-carrier journey. And it's been about consistently the case in terms of the extent of that value leadership. Now we're always introducing new promotions. But I want to be really clear. Our strategy as a company is about showing customers the remarkable value of Magenta MAX. That's our strategy. And you can see how it's unfolding in terms of customers self-selecting up our stack to buy our best products because they are the very best expression of the very best 5G network. And that is running on all cylinders, allowing us today with the best values and with incredible promotions in the market to tell you about for the first time in the 10 years I've been here, an outlook of ARPU rising. And that was something we just did a few minutes ago for the first time in the entire decade I've been here on the strength of this strategy. And so it really shows that we can have it both ways. We can have the best value in the industry, remarkable promotions, bring competition to this market like we always have, to no greater or lesser extent than in our past, while simultaneously showcasing the incredible value of our leading 5G network in the expression of Magenta MAX and attracting customers to that best expression. So it's a really nice place to be. We like this market competitive. We know we're stewards of a healthy and vibrant marketplace that has room for all of us. But one thing is very clear. As it becomes less known, whether they're will be enough room for the Verizons, the new entrants, the cable companies, et cetera, it's very clear that our tailwinds of growth driven by our rational and well-articulated growth strategy is a real differentiator for us. And that's something that I think people need to understand as their -- investors, I know, are looking for growth but they're also looking for reliable safe bets on growth. And that's what we strive to achieve quarter after quarter. Yes. I'll let Mike talk about it. First, I'll just give you some context. I know a quarter ago, we talked about reaching an agreement with DISH as a path forward, that's a real win-win for everybody and that continues to be under review by the Department of Justice. But I will say we've gone forward with DISH in a very productive way and they have with us, really finding a path forward and that's been nice to see for their customers and for all of our businesses. But obviously, we have a large and diverse wholesale base and maybe I'll let Mike Katz tell you about what's happening. Great. I'll start on the first one and maybe ask Neville to pile in. We're really delighted with what we're seeing here. I think this product has been a fantastic showcase of what the leading 5G network can really do. And we're now operating at scale with 1 million customers. Net Promoter Scores have risen again quarter-over-quarter which is terrific to see now 3x the Net Promoter Scores of a cable company. Our download speeds meet the nationwide medians of cable companies. And that's something most people wouldn't really appreciate. Our average usage is 300 to 400 gigs per month and yet we're able to serve that with rising Net Promoter Scores. We have a tail, 10%-ish or so, that are using a terabyte per month. And so these are normative figures that you would see in an industry with a product that's really driving satisfaction. Maybe Neville, you can talk about what's behind it and add any color? And Mike, I think you know our basic game plan here. What's fascinating about this business is we are able to offer it nationwide now across 40 million homes and compete in a relatively even basis in all parts of this country because our go-to-market plan is based on an excess capacity model. And so we aren't dedicating large sums of capital to this business. Instead, our algorithms look at normal mobile usage that's rapidly growing because of the strength of our 5G network and we expect will continue to rapidly grow. We also expect we will continue to take share. We model all that forward and find the pockets where even all those extra customers and all their extra mobile usage won't soak up the capacity of this remarkable network. That's where we approve applicants for 5G home broadband. And so that's really interesting because you have that swallow capacity. And it's just the nature of a mobile network. Our spectrum coverage is relatively consistent and therefore our capacity can be relatively consistent. But mobile usage isn't. Mobile usage is in some places and not others. You have to be everywhere to be competitive. Once you're there, you might as well light up all your spectrum. And so that's really the nature of this. And it allows us to have the economics to be able to go to market with a competitive offer for large swaths of the population and price it attractively and still make a return. Okay; you had a second question about buybacks. I have lost the office pool came in on the third question. So Peter, please tell us what to say. Are you sure you don't want to ask you about top 100 or Sprint integration because that would cover all of the -- okay. Great, Jon, well, let's try to hit those in rapid fire. First on fixed wireless, maybe Mike, you can give us a little color on where the customers are coming from. And then Jon get ready to tell us about small markets and rural areas and what's going on there. Great. And Jon and Callie, you get ready. And also not only has Jonathan been asking about it but also Roger Entner is asking again about business, what's going on with market share? What kind of customers are we winning? But Jon, small markets in rural areas. One of the things -- reasons I made my joke at the beginning is you were asking about all of our growth objectives. And before we ask Peter to wrap up on wireline, I just want to remind everybody that what you just heard from the team is that we are absolutely on track with the bold aspirations that we shared now more than a year ago with you as we laid out our multiyear plan on this business. And what's interesting about us that makes us so different as a growth bet is that we have a rational, articulated growth strategy based on proven areas of underpenetration where we know we have opportunity and where we are making down payments and are very much on track. And that's what investors should be asking us about. So I just want to make sure everybody is reminded that we have major underpenetrated opportunities in small markets and rural areas, 40% of this country where we've already grown from 13% to 15% share and we're tracking beautifully. We have major underpenetrated segments in business, a huge part of this marketplace and probably growing in the wake of the pandemic where we're very underpenetrated and where Callie just reminded us, our present performance would get us to those multiyear aspirations. We articulated a huge opportunity in high-speed Internet and now 2 quarters in a row have showed you that we're the nation's fastest-growing broadband provider. Our top 100 markets where we lead the industry are also a big opportunity. And you're going to hear us talking more and more about the growth trajectory that we see with prime consumers and quality seekers in the top 100 markets. Despite our leadership, there are tens of millions of people in the top 100 markets who've never given T-Mobile a serious look because they want the best network. Now that we offer that, there's a huge opportunity for us to unlock there and you'll be hearing more about that. And then finally, Sprint integration. I already told you that Sprint integration is a growth tailwind. If Sprint was churning like T-Mobile, we'd be at 900,000 phone net adds this quarter. And we're making the progress that we promised you with one of the biggest sequential churn reductions this industry has ever seen, our best one in 7 years, a whopping 17 basis points quarter-over-quarter, all on the strength of executing like we said we would on a major growth trajectory. So that's one thing I want to make sure to remind people about. And then finally, big question was about wireline, what's going on there? What are the opportunities that we see? What were you really talking about? Okay. Terrific. Before we go back to the phones, obviously, we've got questions coming in on Twitter. We usually get interesting ones from Bill Ho. I see one want to hear Neville about network. It looks like we're up again in 5G reach out to 315 million people. Where is that really going? And where are we on ultra-capacity 5G? Can you forecast for us what to expect there because that's the real game. It's very interesting what's happening here. You've heard us say before that we see that we're 2 years ahead in the 5G race now. And 2 years from now, we'll be 2 years ahead in the 5G race. And that's not a quip, that's not a competitive quip. That's actually an aspiration that we take very serious. And you just heard Neville say that by the end of this year, we'll reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity. That's an aspiration that Verizon has by the end of '24, except only 250 million. But by the end of next year, we'll be at 300 million. And what's interesting is our goal is that in many places, it's not just to have 300 million people deployed but in many places to have fully 200 megahertz of 5G dedicated spectrum. That's remarkable in terms of what we can do to change customers' experiences on smartphones, to serve enterprises, government customers and, of course, broadband and other new applications. And so that's our aspiration. We take it very seriously. And one of the things you should judge us on is, have we been through over and over and over again to the things that we said we would go do. Because we've been very clear-eyed about this strategy for many years and I think that consistency is something that people should acknowledge. Absolutely. I'll start and then I'll ask Jon Freier to jump in and maybe Neville as well. I'll remind you of a couple of things that we've said in the past and something I said in my prepared remarks. What we do for this 40% of the country, we call it our precision playbook. We've divided that segment of the country into 775 submarkets. And what we do is study our relative competitiveness. And so it starts with the network. Is our network every place people in that local area need for us to believe that we have all the factors of success required to win market share. Now this is observable because we are number one in many places in this country. We know what it takes. And we take that same observable logic and we apply it now to places we were never highly competitive. And what we've said in our upfront remarks is that we believe we are competitive across about 30% of those places, the POPs represented by those places. And that will be competitive across about 50% by the end of this year. Now, I'll guide you. There are some layers of competitiveness. That's sort of our base level and above. And there's levels that we can get to above that. But we measure that number because what we see is when we have that level of competitiveness, what we call right to win, we are able to see win shares in line with our aspirations such that we know that the price that we promised you is within reach. And that's really important. So again, we're in those 30% of POPs where we already have a right to win, we are winning. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in this strategy. We'll be at 50% by the end of this year. And maybe, Jon, you can talk about what's going on as we enter each of these markets, what formula we bring to make sure that we get the win share that's required for us to grow our market share. A lot of times, our breakthroughs come from willingness to lead things in an unconventional way like with team of experts a few years ago and Jon just told you about another big breakthrough management concept that we've fully implemented across the country that we think is a big part of our, I guess, now not so secret sauce. Great. And by the way, so before we go back to the phones, Neville back to you. There's a question from Tech Life Channel, Techlife32, What's going on with those 10,000 new sites because 5G coverage is great but what about coverage? So what's happening with our promised site expansion? And while you're at, we did say in our prepared remarks where we are on decommissioning. This is the year of decommissioning. We expect to complete the task this year. Maybe you can give an update on how that's going, too. Neville and his team are very busy. This is, as you know, the peak capital year in our business plan. And we have teams that are upgrading literally hundreds and hundreds of sites every single week. In a year, we're going to simultaneously reach 260 million people with Ultra Capacity 5G while completing the shutdown of the Sprint network well and ahead of our schedule. So it's a -- and we're very much on track. And it's fantastic to see the team's execution in every part of this country. Great. I'll start with the second one and then hand it to Peter on the first one. We are delighted with what we're seeing this year on Sprint customer response to everything happening on the network and service and plan front; and you can see it in our results. So one of the things we -- I mentioned a little while ago is that right now, we're substantially complete with about 37% of the customers, bringing them what I'll call all the way across. Now the vast majority of our customers are on the T-Mobile network now, almost all their traffic is on the T-Mobile network now. We'll be moving to shut down the Sprint network this year. But we have a lot of work to do to make sure that the customers come across with T-Mobile plans, T-Mobile phone plans, no remaining leases on their line and all of their traffic on the T-Mobile side. When those things happen, churn is the same. And we have achieved that milestone now for about 37% of the Sprint base. And that's much higher than it was just a few months ago. And so you see the result in the sequential churn improvement because as more and more people achieve that level, more and more of them churn just like T-Mobile churn was. And that's what unfolded over the last quarter. And so that gives us a lot of confidence in our plan. I want to make sure that people don't connect it though to something happening just 2 months from now. I mean when we shut down the Sprint network, it's not just the network traffic. The network traffic is already on T-Mobile. It's the whole thing, getting them migrated to the right plan, the right service structure and, importantly, getting them on a T-Mobile phone payment plan and making sure there's no more leases because those are sources of dissatisfaction. And that's where we're at 37%. It will take us some time to stepwise move through the base. But what we know is that when we do, they love T-Mobile on the other hand and they churn like the lowest-churning brand over the last 2 years. And so that's fantastic. And then specifically to your first question, we'll turn it to Peter on the cost of services. It's nice to see things unfolding the way we predicted. We're very much on track for the $7.5 billion. We increased the in-year synergy attainment with this guidance. And of course, that results in also an increase in cash flows to 30% year-over-year cash flows in the present guidance. So terrific to see that happening. Listen, we promised you a 1-hour call. And so with apologies to those still in the queue, many of whom I'm really sorry we didn't get to because we love you but we'll take the last question, operator. Let me start with Neville and supply chain and then I'll wrap things up with an answer to your question, Simon. Simon, I'm glad you asked that because your question goes -- in my mind, it goes right to the heart of what a lot of people want to know about this sector right now. And I would characterize it really in terms of 2 important questions people have. One, is there room for everybody? What's going -- can this growth continue? What's going to go on when the growth slows down? And if it slows down, will it get unhealthily competitive? Those are the big questions, I think, on people's minds. And I got to tell you, I'm not concerned about those questions. As I've said in the past, first of all, I think what we're seeing is some of that is happening in the dynamic right now out there. And in the very time frame when people are asking these questions, they're asking, \"Hey, how are you going to navigate if things slow down?\" We delivered 1.3 million postpaid net adds, the best in 8 years, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. In the very time frame when people are saying, what about are things slowing down? How are you guys going to do if things slow down? And I love that you're asking that because it reminds everyone listening that this is a business with major underpenetrated growth opportunities that we are proving we know how to execute against. And that's why we reliably bring the performance quarter after quarter. And to the second question people have which is, isn't it going to get crazy out there if there isn't room for everybody? Which is I don't know but I can tell you that the amount of competitiveness that we bring is consistent over time. We are the competition. We like it competitive. It's been relatively consistently competitive through our actions for years now. Customers and businesses are the beneficiaries. Right now, the cost per unit in this industry is lower for consumers and businesses than it's ever been, in a time when every other category has rising prices. We're driving ARPU improvements without price improvement. And we're bringing a level of competitiveness to this industry that's so exciting for consumers and businesses while delivering on financial performance that we promised you and then some. And so people have these 2 questions. Is there room for everybody? I don't know. That's not -- I'm not burdened with that. I can tell you that this quarter it looks like there is. Cables about to report, I think they had a healthy quarter. We're going to see nice numbers there. Our telemetry has usually been pretty good at predicting what to see there. But we delivered an 8-year Q1 all-time almost high. And that shows you that our growth strategy has integrity and it's reliable, safe, quarter-after-quarter growth that comes in just like we promised you it would. And it comes in with a healthy industry and a dynamic where T-Mobile can achieve its cash flow aspirations. And so look, we like it. We look at the industry. We know we play an important role as stewards of a healthy industry and we think it's a healthy industry. And whether or not it's a healthy industry, it's going to be an industry that's healthy for T-Mobile. So you got to think that in all the time that you have, we really appreciate you. Thanks for coming quarter after quarter with your great discussions. And we look forward to engaging with you more. Appreciate it."

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; and as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let's get it over to Mike to tell us about our results.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jud. Welcome, everybody. As you can see, if you're viewing online, I'm here with a good cross-section of our senior team once again. We're coming to you today from Bellevue, Washington and looking forward to a great discussion. But first, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on a historic year for T-Mobile and the exciting momentum that we bring into 2024. '23 was another year for T-Mobile of industry-leading growth in both customers and key financials, including all-time record results across many metrics. It was also a year where T-Mobile became established as the overall network leader. Built on our extensive advantages in 5G. And it was the year that we effectively completed the biggest arguably the most successful telecommunications merger integration in the world, delivering synergies bigger and faster than even our own ambitious goals and doing it while also accelerating 5G investment in this country to the benefit of consumers and businesses. Our remarkably consistent, best value best network strategy, delivered industry-leading postpaid phone net additions of 3.1 million in 2023. This was driven by our highest postpaid phone gross adds in company history, up 2% for the year and up 6% in Q4. And by our lowest postpaid phone churn in company history for the year. Our net adds essentially matched our great results from '22 despite industry postpaid phone net adds decreasing year-over-year. You know what that means? It means that our unique formula enabled us to take a higher share of postpaid phone net adds than a year ago. In fact, '23 was our highest share of postpaid phone net adds since the merger, showing the ongoing durability of our differentiated strategy. And we finished the year on a high note, with Q4 postpaid phone net adds of 934,000 highest in the industry by a wide margin, and we did it with rising ARPA, up almost 2% delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid service revenue and core EBITDA in Q4 while also nearly doubling our adjusted free cash flow. Let's talk about Broadband. We added over 2.1 million customers in '23, our biggest growth year yet with more net new customers than the other largest providers combined, as our product just continues to resonate in the market. And we finished strong with 541,000 nets in Q4, making us one of the largest ISPs in the nation with 4.8 million customers and counting at year-end. At T-Mobile, our network is the key enabler of our growth, not only for the success that we've had to date, but also for years to come. I predicted years ago that our well-established 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that was proven loud and clear in 2023. By leading third parties like Ookla and OpenSignal, time and again, with T-Mobile sweeping every category of their test for overall network performance. Listen, it boils down to this. T-Mobile has the broadest and the deepest and the most advanced 5G network in the US today. And we have the assets and capabilities to further extend our network leadership in '24 and beyond. Okay. One final network point, we recently celebrated a pivotal moment in our ground-breaking alliance with SpaceX. By kicking off testing of direct satellite to cellular communications, our teams are really excited about what's coming. Let me just remind you of one thing. Our network leadership still isn't yet fully recognized by millions of network seekers who are still potential future customers for T-Mobile. And yet that same network leadership is already driving our strong win share, particularly in underpenetrated areas like enterprise and government and also in smaller markets and rural areas in our consumer business. Let me just double-click on that growth momentum. T-Mobile for Business, delivered the highest postpaid phone net adds in company history in 2023. And we exited the year with great momentum, with Q4 being our highest quarterly net adds ever. Meanwhile, in our Consumer Group, we continued to grow our share of households, both in smaller markets and rural areas where we are well on our way to our 2025 targets and even in the top 100 markets, where we grew our share year-over-year on the strength of our network and our compelling value proposition. We're executing our balanced growth playbook with great and consistent success. And the best part is we still have a lot of room to run. All of this added up to delivering the highest consolidated service revenue growth in the industry in '23. And it was an industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. On that all-important postpaid service revenue metric, we delivered 6% growth in 2023, way above our next closest competitor. That growth led to core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 10% and free cash flow growth of nearly 80%. All of this enables our substantial stockholder return model, which has returned $17 billion to stockholders so far through the end of '23, including our first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4. Now Peter will share our guidance with you in a moment. But the short version is this. We see continued strong customer and revenue growth, translating into rapid growth in cash flows in 2024 and beyond, and supporting our ambitious plans for shareholder returns that we've already shared with you. Before I wrap up, because this is a year-end report, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a connected world where everyone can thrive. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for all in today's highly connected and digital world. And that's why we are so proud to have connected nearly 6 million students. And provided $6.4 billion in products and services so far under our flagship initiative Project 10Million and our other education initiatives. We've also partnered with Welcome.US to provide service through Metro by T-Mobile to refugees entering the US as part of a multiyear commitment of 200,000 lines. It is difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country, without the connectivity that most of us take for granted. We are also working hard to create a more sustainable future, and we are proud to be the first US wireless provider to commit to achieving net zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040 using SBTi's net-zero standard. All right. Let me just wrap up with why I am so excited about what's ahead. We are now entering a period of tremendous value creation at T-Mobile, driven by ongoing growth leadership and having -- and by having completed both a historic merger and a massive 5G network build that are foundational to unlocking the cash flow potential of this business. Our network is now a differentiated competitive advantage that complements our well-established value leadership. This unique and powerful formula means that our significant growth and value creation opportunities only continue to scale, and they have lots of room to run. As we enter 2024 with momentum, I could not be more proud of this team and of our employees who remind us every day that it's better over here at T-Mobile. All right, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights as well as our 2024 guidance.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Well, thank you, Mike. As you can see, our 2023 results highlighted our strong execution and accelerating our merger integration while leveraging our network leadership and fame for value to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. Our Land and Expand strategy also led to industry-leading growth in postpaid account net adds as well as ARPA growth of 1.3%. Before I jump into our guidance, I would also like to take a moment to note a couple of items impacting our Q4 earnings per share. In December of 2023, we issued 48.8 million shares to SoftBank as the 45-day VWAP of our stock price reached the threshold price under the letter agreement from 2020. This obviously increased our share count, which impacted our diluted EPS and as it is treated as if those shares had been issued for the full quarter. We expect that dilution to be more than offset by our ongoing share repurchases in 2024. We also accelerated depreciation on certain technology assets in Q4 and would anticipate a year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million to $1 billion in full year 2024, as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top line and the bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into how we expect that growth to continue in 2024. Starting with customers. We expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million the same starting guidance as last year, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to moderate. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds will be phones. And the guidance also assumes the final portion of deactivations of our lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector with most of that impact already having been accelerated into the second half of 2023. As we noted last quarter, we had always anticipated many of these connections, which supported educational institutions through the pandemic would roll off as the emergency connectivity program wound down and things return to normal. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We expect it to be between $31.3 billion and $31.9 billion up nearly 9% year-over-year at the midpoint and above the midpoint of our Capital Markets Day guidance for 2024. This is three times the growth rate of peers and a year-over-year dollar increase comparable to what we delivered in 2023 despite no material incremental merger synergy benefits in 2024. Our sustained growth represents the power of our industry-leading service revenue growth, the operating leverage of our profitable growth model and the opportunity to continue to drive operating efficiencies in the business. We would expect slightly different shaping across the quarters now that we are past the integration. For example, we would expect slightly less sequential improvement from Q4 2023 to Q1 of this year than we saw last year as we achieved full run rate synergies in Q4 2023 and no longer have that as an incremental sequential factor as we had in past Q4 to Q1 progressions. We would expect the operating leverage and efficiencies to drive EBITDA this year to build throughout the year, layered against the seasonal trends of the business. We expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in the industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Our pull forward of CapEx into 2022 and 2023 has provided us with a broad multilayer 5G network on which we can now deploy additional spectrum for capacity across those existing radios without material incremental CapEx required. Our capital-efficient and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Our expectations for free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs is in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up approximately 22% over last year at the midpoint and five times the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization, and this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. We expect Q1 free cash flow to be approximately 20% of that full year midpoint given several items that fall early in the year. First, we expect Q1 to be the peak CapEx quarter at probably 30% of the full year midpoint of the CapEx guidance I just shared with you. Second, we expect approximately half of the $600 million to $700 million of anticipated full year '24 cash merger-related costs to be in Q1. Third, we have cash severance for workforce actions taken late last year or if the monthly payments to Cogent following the Wireline sale will taper after April. And finally, there are working capital seasonality elements coming off the higher holiday sales period. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 2% in 2024. Further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023. In closing, we expect '24 to be another year of profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow delivering the highest free cash flow margin in the industry to unlock shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?\nJud Henry: All right. Let's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing star then one and via X by sending a tweet to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using $TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator first question please.\nOperator: The first question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more update on where you are on some of the smaller markets in terms of your market share gain and how that's factoring into your guide for this year and the same sort of thing for enterprise and government? And where are we in that status? And perhaps on fixed wireless, it was a strong result despite some seasonality. Where are you in terms of exploring additional capacity options on a cost-effective manner? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Let's start with smaller markets and rural areas. Jon, why don't you jump in?\nJon Freier: Yes, you bet. Hi, Simon. I'm just delighted with what's happening here in smaller markets and rural areas. I've been talking to all of you about this since our Analyst Day event back in March of 2021. And back in that time, we were at a 13% share of household position. And we set this incredibly ambitious goal to get to 20% by the end of the year 2025 across the entire segment, which, by the way, is 140 million people, 40% of the US, about 50 million households. And I updated you last time when we, during our Q3 earnings report about our share-taking progress in those markets and some of the really good results that we're seeing. And I'm pleased to tell you that, we've now arrived at a share of household position in smaller markets of rural areas of about 17.5%. And so I'm really, really pleased by that. And the last time I talked to you about this was about nine months ago, and we were at 16.5%, so a full percentage point since that time. And when you look at what we're doing with the 5G network build that Ulf and his team have been doing the distribution expansion and bringing this incredible marketing infrastructure out to smaller markets and rural areas. People are just loving what we're doing. We're having a lot of fun doing it. And I got to tell you that it looks like we're really in a place where we can achieve that 20% goal by 2025 based on where we are, but I'm really more excited and I think the more compelling opportunity is what we can do beyond the 20%. I don't have anything to tell you about right here right now about that. But I tell you, I'm getting really excited about what we can be doing beyond this 20% goal as you think about our continued velocity in these particular markets.\nMike Sievert: Absolutely. Great, Jon. And also on Fixed Wireless, the product is just really resonating. Maybe Mike, you can say what, some of the things that we're doing is to respond to this ongoing growth and the acceptance of the product in the marketplace.\nMichael Katz: Yes. I mean one thing that is kind of just amazing when you look back at it, we've essentially been in the market with our Fixed Wireless product for two years. And in two years, we've gone from a launch product to what you saw at the end of Q4, which is nearly 5 million customers on Fixed Wireless, making us one of the largest ISPs in America with a product that still leads versus every other industry in customer satisfaction. So we're really proud of what's been built here and continued momentum. We saw gross adds this year, the highest they've ever been. So we have a lot of demand for this product. And so one of the decisions you saw us recently take was reverting back to our standard pricing in our Fixed Wireless product. We've been so moving away from our promotional pricing that we've been on for the last two years to our standard pricing which we put into market earlier this month. And we think that still offers the best value inside the broadband business and the best experience as demonstrated by the NPS scores that I just talked about. So we think there's still room to grow in HSI. We still, with a 5 million customer base still runway in front of us to grow both in new customers but also in services. We think having a 5 million customer broadband base gives us the opportunity to bring more services into the home, which the team is actively exploring.\nMike Sievert: And then finally, Simon and not to steal your thunder off just to make the short version. We haven't drawn any new conclusions versus what we previously told you about possible models. Beyond this initial capital light model that we have for high-speed Internet. As you know, our forecast all along have said that model takes us to 7 million to 8 million subscribers. We're well on our way. We'll monitor that as we get closer. And we got a lot of time left. So stay tuned if we're able to provide you with an update on that in the future, but no update today.\nSimon Flannery: All right. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: All right, Simon.\nJud Henry: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Craig.\nCraig Moffett: Yeah, hi. Thank you. You just talked about the pricing of FWA and the move to your standard pricing. I wonder if you could just talk about the outlook for pricing of your mobile service as well? How do you see ARPU playing out over the course of 2024? And there's been a lot of talk that we're in a market where prices are rising generally should we sort of think about baking that into our expectations for the coming year?\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Craig. A couple of things. First of all, you heard Peter guide a confident guide on 2% growth in ARPA on the year. And that's terrific to see. And obviously, there's this ongoing trend that customers who buy T-Mobile can't get enough of it, and they're moving up our rate card. And that's great to see. So we're in a great spot. And before I say more about what opportunities we might see, I'll remind everybody listening that we're in an era of unprecedented value that consumers and businesses are realizing from this category generally. I've mentioned previously that typically today across the category, not just at T-Mobile, customers are getting three times more data than just five years ago. And at four times greater speeds industry-wide than five years ago. So there's tremendous value being given to customers in this category and if there are ways for us to find optimizations in terms of how we deliver that enormous value so that we can be more competitive and more efficient at how we operate including looking in our rate card and looking at our rate plans and looking at our policies and procedures, we'll find those opportunities. Q4, we took some of those opportunities. We found a more efficient way to handle auto pay discounts with our customers and fully put that through the base throughout Q4, and that's an important optimization. Right now, taking a lead from Netflix as they've changed their portfolio, we've made changes to the Netflix benefits that we give, which have been well accepted by customers. So there's a theme here. We may find optimizations, but we will be guided by a couple of things. One, what customers accept and appreciate because that's really important. And number two, we have no intentions of sacrificing our brand position as the value leader in terms of what you get for what you pay in this marketplace. That's always been a differentiator for us, and we will defend that jealously. But I'd tell you, there's opportunities that could be there in an era of unprecedented value being seen by consumers and businesses. And if we can take those and meet those guidelines that I've laid out, we'll do so.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And Craig, with respect to ARPU, I mean, as we've talked about multiple times, it's very much a mix-driven metric. And on the consumer side, we have seen continued growth in ARPU. Now that's offset with some of the success and tremendous value creation that we've had in enterprise and government. Those are obviously lower ARPU customers with high CLVs, larger ARPAs. And so that's why the focus on one, the customer value differential that we're bringing and our ARPA playbook, we believe is the right way to go, and you can see that demonstrated in what we delivered in 2023 and Q4 from a postpaid service revenue perspective, that's where you're kind of focused in with postpaid ARPU. And frankly, what we see from a service revenue opportunity in 2024 is even larger percentage growth than what we delivered in 2023. So more than the 3.1% full year growth we'll see in '24 despite, of course, some slight ongoing headwinds in wholesale with the offset of TracFone and other carriers. So we couldn't be more excited about this is the right playbook that delivers the most value creation in the industry.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nJud Henry: All right. Next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Actually just a few sort of housekeeping questions actually. I'm wondering if you can give us what the number of ACP subs in your bases and whether you're sort of anticipating using some of those if the benefit goes away? And how that sort of factored into guidance? And then ditto on bonus depreciation. If bonus depreciation gets extended, how would that impact your free cash flow guidance? Thanks so much.\nMike Sievert: I'll start on ACP, and I hand it to Peter to finish on ACP and take the bonus depreciation question. When it comes to the number of subscribers in our reported base, it's substantially none. There's a very, very small amount of Metro customers, and that's it. So it's constrained to our Assurance Wireless business, which is not reported as subscribers and to our wholesale business. And as it relates to ACP and what's happening to it, obviously, that's in motion. You may have noticed that our EBITDA guide was a tiny bit wider this year. I would tell you that all the outcomes that we see for ACP are fully embedded in the guide that we gave you on EBITDA. And look, our risk profile around ACP is a little different than, say, a broadband company. They went very big into it, committed lots of customers and numbers to it. And also, I think one subscribers that may or may not stick around. Mobile is different. Mobile is a product that customers will keep. And if they lose that discount our job, and I think our team is up to the task is to go win them over with our high-value offers. And we have some of the best brands in the space with incredible value propositions. And as other wireless providers see the same thing happen, we will get after it and position our brands as the place that those people land. So there's a risk profile around it for T-Mobile, but I think much smaller than with other players, and it's fully embedded in the guidance. That's that, I'll let Peter pick up there as well as talk about the bonus depreciation.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And just housekeeping wise, again, we don't participate in ACP on the postpaid side. We have a little immaterial amount through Metro and the rest, Assurance isn't reported in our subscriber counts and of course, wholesale customers are not either. So that's it with respect to ACP. And on bonus depreciation, look, we're continuing to monitor the developments. And of course, we're very supportive of a tax regime that stimulates investment into the network into US leadership on this front. With regards to '24, we're not anticipating to be a significant cash taxpayer, so it wouldn't impact the guide for 2024. And we'll see where it goes. And of course, as it develops, we could update you later in the year for outer years.\nJonathan Chaplin: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMike Sievert: Hi, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thanks, guys. Hey, good afternoon. Hey, if we could talk a little bit about competition, that would be great, I guess, from, we can take it from both sides. First, from a gross adds standpoint, you guys saw some acceleration in phone gross adds. Quarter-to-quarter. So just what you're seeing in terms of sort of competitive offers in the market in the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter. And then on the other side, churn ticked up for after the first time in a while, I think. So what's potentially driving that in terms of postpaid phone churn? And do you expect it to that to remain elevated or keep moving in that direction? Or what should we expect there? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: I'll start on churn and maybe hand it to Mike on competition. Churn was up 9 basis points sequentially. And if you look at the last several years since we completed the merger from Q3 to Q4, the average is 10 basis points sequentially. So it's right in line, maybe even a little better than past sequential moves. Our business tends to be seasonal, with Q4 being a higher time period of churn. And that being said I was really pleased with getting the 9 basis points given some of the optimizations that were fully implemented in Q4 that I mentioned in response to an earlier question. Look, there's no question in my mind that we are on a journey towards the best churn in this industry. And that's because we have the best value and the best network and a history of being able to treat customers with respect. And so we'll find that journey making its way. '24 is going to be an interesting year because as I mentioned earlier, there are optimizations across the board that we may find are in our best interest to take. As long as they don't put at risk, our superior value proposition as long as there are things that will be well accepted or even appreciated by customers. And so I can't give you specifics on the guide. I can tell you that with this churn, 9 basis points higher sequentially, we delivered a big beat in postpaid net additions on phones of 934,000, bigger than we guided even during the middle of the quarter. And so we're very comfortable with the formula. And we're comfortable with the formula in part because competition has been remarkably consistent. I'll let Mike talk about what we're seeing.\nMichael Katz: Yes. This has always been a really competitive environment in the industry and dynamic and competitive. And honestly, that's the way we like it. For us, when there's lots of competition and customers are looking around shopping, T-Mobile ends up being the net winner. And you see that both in '23 with, and in Q4, specifically with T-Mobile having the highest share of net adds. And you saw it consistently throughout the year with the account growth that T-Mobile posted, which was highest by far in the industry. What we saw in Q4, I would describe as generally consistent with what we saw last year. Offers were pretty much the same, very aggressive, but pretty consistent with previous year. I think what's been different is the way that T-Mobile or what's evolved, maybe I should say, is the way that T-Mobile competes. Mike and Peter both talked about this value proposition we have of best value, which historically has always been the thing that T-Mobile has owned. And then more recently developed the best network. And those two things together really creates a unique value proposition that's unmatched in the industry and is resonating with customers. You saw it again in Q4, and you continue to see us enhance it as we did this year with the launch of the Go5G plans the launch of Phone Freedom, which in a shopping time like Q4 as customers are looking to upgrade, we think, really resonated, and you saw it in the net add performance.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Thanks, John.\nJud Henry: Thanks, John. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions, if I could. First, when you look at the core EBITDA margin profile, are you still targeting to get to a margin at or above 50%? And how do you see the pacing to get there? And then second, was there anything specific that influence the pace of share buyback dollars, I think it was down a little bit year-over-year, down sequentially and maybe put that into the context of your current capital return goals that you highlighted a few months back. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: All right. Let's start with core EBITDA and core EBIDTA margin. Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Well, Mike, certainly, our long-run aspiration is to continue to see margin expansion in core EBITDA. But much like you see us focus really, the primary focus here is to continue to be the leader and continue expanding in our ability to deliver free cash flow margin relative to service revenue because that takes out all the noise of relative differentials and how P&Ls are recognized, backhaul, et cetera, and really provides a true color for value creation. And that's where we're already in a leadership position and continue to see more expansion opportunity there.\nMike Sievert: Great. And you obviously saw us in Q4 take some investments to make sure that we could have a beat on customers and revenues, and that's just helping with our confident guide in 2024. So when we see opportunities like that, we take them. We've talked with you many times about that in the past. Second question was about share buybacks. What happened in Q4? There was a little bit of a slowdown. What are we seeing now? What do people expect?\nPeter Osvaldik: Naturally, Mike, I think what you saw was a little bit of a tapering. We're not going to talk about day-to-day dynamics, but a little bit of a tapering of the share buyback program. As we were nearing that issuance and that trigger point of the SoftBank share. So we're past that now. I think we're confident in our ability to deliver what we've signed up for here, which is another incremental up to $16 billion currently authorized in share buybacks and dividends for 2024 and pacing towards that.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nPeter Osvaldik: You bet. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEric Luebchow: Appreciate it. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I just wanted to touch on the cost side of the business. I know you mentioned you're at your target merger synergy run rate and you had the head count reduction earlier this year. What other initiatives are on the table to kind of help you keep moving leverage up in the business, either on the technology side in distribution of small markets or anything else that you could comment on? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Yes, I'll just start by kind of reminding everybody that, as Peter already pointed out, the '24 guide at the midpoint is higher than our earlier Capital Markets Day guide, and it's 9% year-over-year, which is three times the expectation of our peers. And so it's really terrific to see this business scaling and without the incremental year-over-year benefit of big expansions and synergies, that's mostly behind us almost entirely. And so that's really great to see. It obviously comes from ongoing progression of valuable customers, some of the best customers with the best payment records in the industry as well as efficiencies that we can see in how we run the business.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And on to that, as we said, a big part of this is also the service revenue growth leadership that we anticipate, that we expect to increase in 2024 on a growth basis relative to '23. And then there's, it's across the business. I mean we've made tremendous investments as we are expanding the network as we are expanding distribution. We're reaping some of that. But make no mistake, this is a very scrappy team that's looking at not only just currently where can you continue to drive efficiencies. But how do you take advantage the network modernization of technology modernization of all the buzzwords that you hear these days around AI and other things, but how do you do it in an uncarrier fashion with the customer at the center of it while driving efficiencies out of the business. So we see a lot of room to run here over a multiyear arc on this front.\nEric Luebchow: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. Good afternoon. I had two, if I could. First, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for upgrade rates as they relate to this year's free cash flow guidance? Do you think these low upgrade rates we're seeing across the industry are going to begin to tick up anytime soon? And are you doing anything proactively in retention that might drive it up? And then separately, Mike, you mentioned that you're in testing with SpaceX on their device, direct-to-device solution. When you do get to the commercial deployment of the service. Just curious as to what your expectations are for the products capabilities for customers how it fits into the product set? And also, if you have any sense for how much of your base this feature or this capability is actually important too? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. Great. Well, let's start with upgrade rates. We don't see big catalysts for change here. Around the edges, there may be some, and we can talk about those. For example, we have a brand-new rate plan called Go5G Next, which offers upgrade benefits, could change it on the margin and other things. But generally speaking, people are keeping their phones longer. And they're doing that because the phones are very expensive, and they're very capable. For our customers, 75% of them have 5G phones that are able to take advantage of the vast majority of our advanced network capabilities that we already have implemented. And so those kinds of things are a great position to be in, and I don't think there's a big catalyst for change in 2024. As it relates to SpaceX, yes, we're really excited about it. And way back when we announced it, we talked about the capabilities, starting with text messaging, peer-to-peer text messaging, the ability to reach people if you can see the sky. We expected to cover the Continental US big parts of Alaska, big parts of the world's oceans and be able to allow you to stay in connection with your loved ones. That will progress into picture messaging and eventually talk and other capabilities. And the beta we expect if things go well, we should have these capabilities in customer hands this year. As it relates to who it appeals to, look, anybody that finds themselves on occasion in one of the 500,000 square miles in this country, not covered by any of the networks. And that's most of us. And so there's something about the peace of mind of knowing that if you can see the sky, generally speaking, you're connected. And that's our dream. That's the aspiration that we set out when we announced this partnership, and it's great to have the first satellites in the sky.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Two, if I could. First is on Fixed Wireless. Earlier in the year, I guess, in '23, I think we all thought that the second derivative might slow down a little bit and in terms of growth rates, it might be closer to 500,000. But when we look at the second half of the year, it feels like there is still some second derivative growth left. And so it would be great to understand if this is demand driven or to some extent, as you open up spectrum and as your distribution channels become more efficient, this is more supply driven. So it would be good to understand the mix of what's driving that growth? And then secondly, on the ACP side, sorry, one more housekeeping question. I mean as you explained, I mean, it's not a big impact, and it's mostly on the wholesale side. But the general article today mentioned some of the wholesale providers and their exposures, which seemed pretty big, and I think some of them use your network. This is a high-margin revenue stream. So is there any way for us to understand if there is any time line around when we might see this. As you mentioned, it's not material. So maybe it doesn't matter in the full year scheme of things, but I don't know if it changes the cadence of EBITDA in any way?\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. We don't know whether it will be material. But we do know that, and are reasonably confident that it's fully embedded within all of the outcomes that we provided in our guidance range to you. But let's start with Fixed Wireless and go to Mike. And then Mike, if you want to transition to what we're seeing with ACP and Peter will probably pile on.\nMichael Katz: Yes. I think on the Fixed Wireless side, like I mentioned earlier, we've seen steady demand for this product since it's launched. And a lot of the things that you mentioned are absolutely true. Like our execution has gotten better. We have built more stores. So like we've got distribution closer to customers in areas like rural areas. There's more awareness of the product, both generally and the overall market but also within our base. All of those things certainly have been factors. I think the other big thing that's been a factor is churn. Because remember, the net additions are the difference between gross adds and the number of customers that churn. And we've seen a steady improvement with churn with HSI year-over-year, really across every single 10-year cohort. We knew that churn would come down as our base aged and got into later cohorts, which we see the later cohorts of customers in this churn at a rate that's pretty comparable with cable. We knew that churn would come down as our base age. But what's really exciting is as the product has improved itself and as the experience has improved and frankly, as our execution has improved, even the early 10-year cohort churn has started to reduce, and we've seen that consistently throughout the year.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And I would just add on to that to your point, remember, we're well on our way to our 7 million to 8 million target and hence, some of the moves we made to really optimize value creation. And so I'd probably expect on a quarterly basis, nets might be in the 400,000 range is really what you need to get to that ambition, while creating more value given some of the promotional pricing that we've now pared back. On ACP, I think the important element is we'll see where it goes. But our anticipation with everything that Mike highlighted around the category itself is the outcomes inclusive of should ACP not continue on, is embedded in the core EBITDA guidance range that we provided as well as in our expectation that service revenue growth will be larger in full year '24 than 2023. So that's all embedded in the guidance that we provided.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right.\nOperator: The next question is from Ric Prentiss with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.\nRic Prentiss: Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to follow along those same lines a little bit. Can you help us understand, obviously, track loads coming off maybe some DISH coming off on the wholesale side as well. How much magnitude should we be expecting wholesale might drop this year knowing that you have some ranges out there?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. We haven't specifically guided to that. And remember, we have a little bit of visibility given some of the MPGs, which do trail off with respect to DISH. But I'd expect a continued year-over-year sequential decline, but not a specific guide on wholesale.\nMike Sievert: And that's obviously factored into the guidance that we've provided.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely.\nRic Prentiss: Right. And then any update on Mint? I think we're going on, what, 10, 11 months. And what is their position on ACP?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. So Mint, we anticipate Mint to close in Q1 and that is included in the guide itself. And of course, that will result once it does close and a little bit of service revenue and cost geography changes with minimal net impact to core EBITDA, as we talked about earlier. But all of that including ACP contemplation is considered in the guide that we gave. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to speak specifically about Mint as we haven't closed yet.\nRic Prentiss: And last one for me is, you talked a lot about your net adds doing strong service revenue, adjusted EBITDA, particularly versus the peer group. Will we ever hear you guys talk about EPS because clearly the peer group talk to EPS as well. I know you say there are some things that make it tough. But will there be some day where you think about talking to us about an EPS guide?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. I think that they will come. Obviously, we're still in this period in 2023, we had significant merger-related costs. We're going to have a little bit of merger-related costs in 2024, probably 150 in Q1 and 50 in Q2. But you are going to see us have more and more focus on EPS. And obviously, there was a couple, as I mentioned, a couple of catalysts, including the 48.8 million shares for Q4, but you'll see us more and more focused on EPS. Look, the margin expansion is going to flow into the bottom line. And you'll see us there. We're not quite there yet. Little bit more work to do with the merger-related costs and other things, but it's definitely something we keep an eye on, and it's important.\nMike Sievert: And the shareholder return program that we have underway really helps with it overall. Despite this dilution event that we saw, the overall trend is anti-dilution as we retire shares through the program. So it's a good trend to be on.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Thanks.\nJud Henry: All right. We've got a lot of activity on social. Janice, do you want to tell us what we're seeing?\nJanice Kapner: Yes. I think there's one we're seeing this theme in a few places. So I'll take this question. So first of all, congratulations on a great year. But could you provide more color on your enterprise business, especially beyond connectivity and revenue and traction? And I know we haven't really covered that yet.\nJud Henry: Callie?\nCallie Field: Okay. Well, thanks, Janice. And let me just tell you we're in a different phase in our business? Last year, my leaders transformed the talent and activity of our sales team. And we've upgraded our product portfolio with solutions like T-SIM Secure and our connected workplace managed services with Cisco Meraki that we just announced yesterday. We've moved from transacting with lower-level procurement employees to sitting at the table with CIOs as their trusted partners for connectivity solutions. And also, business customers, as we talked about before, they test our network before purchasing. And what they find is the most modern, the most distributed nationwide tri-band 5G stand-alone commercially available for slicing network and they've determined its superiority. And all of this translates right back into our core business. So we delivered on our highest quarter and year ever in business postpaid phone net additions and gross adds. And our results outperformed our benchmark competitor once again. In enterprise, we delivered our highest win share rate with postpaid phone net additions. And our results allowed us to bring on new customers like SalesForce and REI and deepen our relationships with Delta, DoorDash Meta, UPS, just to name a few. And in the public sector, we drove double-digit growth in our new public safety accounts, especially with first responders who recognize that we at T-Mobile provide a more secure, prioritized connection over a faster and larger network. We continue to grow and compete successfully in small businesses, best quarter and year yet and saw positive porting trends versus both of our principal competitors in the third consecutive quarter in a row. So we're bringing in, as Peter mentioned earlier, both highly profitable customers with attractive CLVs, and as it relates to revenue outside of phones, we also saw some key wins in our Advanced Network solutions this past quarter with Formula 1 in Las Vegas, where we successfully demonstrated our commercial application of network slicing with 230 points of sale that was incredible, Ulf, and also signed a deal with PJM Americas, where we're the official 5G innovation partner enhancing how players and fans both experience the game. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight on what we're seeing.\nMike Sievert: It's kind of neat to see that if you just listen to that, that essentially our whole business effort has just kind of grown up. And we're now competing to solve really important organizational problems for enterprise and government. With the corner office. And that's just a different place for us. And it's been interesting to see you've had to retool all the skills and the capabilities and the solutions. And now we have this business that is just breaking records. So there's a lot of room to run because we're at the very beginning, I think, of CIOs and organizational leaders rethinking their connectivity in the era of AI. And when they start to assess who's best positioned in this era to provide reliable, secure connectivity with dedicated spectrum, it's T-Mobile. And so it's just, we're lucky to be in this moment at the very moment that everyone is rethinking everything in technology thanks to the advent of AI and related technologies. So it's a great place to be. Okay.\nJud Henry: All right. Let's go back to the phones.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nPeter Supino: Hi. Thank you. Wondering two things. What about Fixed Wireless. You talked a bit about a slowing net add growth rate still obviously at a really attractive level, with better price and value for you. I wondered as you get closer to your target thinking out a couple of years, do you manage this business at a high rate of speed right up to the target and then slam on the brakes? Or is there some organizational benefit to a more gradual deceleration? And then a second question related to postpaid phone ARPU, I know that you're not guiding to it. And just wondered if you could discuss the drivers in '24 and how they might differ from '23? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Sounds good. I'll take the first one and then maybe hand it to Peter. As we said in response to an earlier question, it's kind of too early to tell what's going to happen as we start to get towards that initial goal for our Fixed Wireless business of 7 million to 8 million subscribers, as Jon reminded us. And right now, we want to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with a fantastic product at a fair price, and we start to ease our way towards that moment. But we also don't know, as we said earlier, whether that's really the final destination or not, whether or not there may be other models that allow us to extend past that. And so look, we'll learn more with each passing quarter. But I think the moves we've made that Mike outlined, I think, well, a few minutes ago, this is the right time for them to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with our great product. We're meeting the demand appropriately and that we're correctly monetizing it so that we're able to continue serving customers in the best possible way. So I'm really happy with where we are. The demand for this product based on the quality of the product has just been phenomenal. And I think a lot of it now is word of mouth. Because that's what happens when you get 4.8 million customers using this product every day at very high nearly the best in the industry, Net Promoter Scores. Well, what they do, they tell other people that they've discovered something great. And that just feeds on itself. So that's a really good place to be. Secondly, unpacking ARPU? And is there anything different in the dynamics for '24 versus '23?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. '24, we'd expect to be generally stable to 2023. And in terms of dynamics, it's going to be the same set of dynamics. You have growth in high-value creating enterprise and government customers. You have growth in tremendously great CLV segment customers like 55+ and Military on the consumer side, which Jon has just seen tremendous success with. You're going to see uptake of our highest tier, highest value rate plans continue at a great clip. And then it just becomes a mix-driven metric. And again, we tend to solve for ARPA and ARPA growth and overall service revenue growth as the focus point. So that's, it's going to be more of the same with regards to ARPU.\nPeter Supino: You bet. Thanks so much.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Hopefully, you can tell we're trying to get to absolutely as many questions as we can as time so let's keep moving.\nJud Henry: All right. Next question.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks, guys. You had a goal a few years ago of a 15-fold increase in wireless capacity. Could you give us an update kind of where we are at this point and just what 5G is meant for maybe latency or anything else with the network. And I know you talked touched on network slicing. What was Formula 1 in PGA doing kind of before you kind of came along for wireless capacity? How much of improvement was us at this point? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Well, first, on overall capacity, it's a good opportunity to turn it to Ulf and maybe you can say what we're seeing now that we're substantially complete with the initial build.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike, and thanks for the question. Well, overall, the network capacity on this fantastic network is outstanding and keeps increasing on 5G as we are pivoting over frequency from our LTE customers over to 5G. And we keep doing that all the time. That's why we can stay ahead of the curve, both with our HSI customers being inside that mobile umbrella, but also making sure that we have enough capacity to grow for all the traffic growth on the network. And as Mike alluded to earlier, we just see an increasing usage. People use more and more of the goodness that we provide. I'll also say that this is across our entire geography. We have to remember that our network is much, much larger in size than 5G than any of our competitor in this country. We have on our 5G coverage more than twice the area of our closest competitor on our ultra-capacity, which is what provides all that capacity. When it comes to the second question, which was around network slicing in Las Vegas, and as Callie alluded to, this was a true success story. We were the only operator in the world or in the country that could provide a true beta version because of our stand-alone core that we have in this network -- of network slicing. In other words, we can program our network to make sure that services work while all the other services and serving all the other customers on the network at the same time. We were able to provide network slicing during the start of the race, which means that we could both make sure that all those points of sales had full service to everything they were doing at the same time as hundred thousand customers per day were using our network during that start the rate, watching their apps, doing all the activities that they will be doing. This has almost never happened in Formula 1 history. It's normally very congested, very difficult to do anything when so many customers are accessing the network at the same time. And that's what network slicing was proving to do in Las Vegas, and it's just started early to come. We're going to roll these kind of things out to much more events in the future.\nMike Sievert: As it relates to your specific question on the 15 times, I actually don't have the answer at my fingertips. So I'm going to look into that. I can tell you that when we made that estimate, what we had in mind were the commercial results that we have delivered in space, being able to see phone usage grow the way it has grown at T-Mobile, it's now more than triple what it was five years ago. Four times the speed and then some and being able to handle this massive home broadband business on top as well as all the growth that we see in enterprise. So as we laid out this network, that way back in 2018 and planned it, we have met every single expectation that we laid out there, including some stringent commitments that we made to the FCC as part of the merger process and just completed a massive nationwide drive in order to be able to make those goals. So I would be surprised if it's anything other than the 15x has been achieved, but I'll have to double check on that. As it relates to the F1, it's fascinating, you hear Ulf talking about Network Slicing and what it's doing for people. And there have been lots of applications. We talk about F1 because it's very public and it's going to be great case study for all of our executive briefing center visits, et cetera. But there have been lots of these now. And look, your previous options were either string wires everywhere, which was not ideal or rely on Wi-Fi. Where you have no control over the radio spectrum and it's a best efforts service with a shared spectrum. And so this is a breakthrough for organizations that they need mission-critical distributed connectivity. Network slicing on 5G is a breakthrough solution for that. We're going to see lots of applications like powering the commercial operations at F1, where it's the perfect solution.\nTimothy Horan: So Mike, do you think there's a way that the industry can grow ARPA faster? I mean, we've been kind of growing way, way below inflation for a long period of time, but we're seeing major improvements in the network. I mean is there any way to kind of get to inflation-type ARPA growth longer term?\nMike Sievert: I mean this industry gives remarkable value, and we've been talking about that a little bit during the call. As it relates to T-Mobile, we're always looking for ways that we can serve customers better and make sure that we build a profitable business around that. And we have to do that smartly so that we defend and extend our fame as the value provider because that's so important, and we have lower costs. So that should be defensible over the long haul as evidenced by things like a lower debt structure and lower cost to service that debt than anybody else in the industry. So it's a defensible place, but we have to defend it by making smart decisions. And we have the best network, and that should allow us to find the right optimization to be able to serve customers better. We can't give you predictions over the long haul other than to say that in 2024, we see opportunities, and that's why we've got a confident guide in 2% year-over-year gain in ARPA. And over the long haul, we'll see what happens. But I will tell you that I'm pleased that customers are getting such incredible value from this category, and that certainly does open up opportunities for us to make sure for T-Mobile that if there are opportunities for us to monetize that in smart ways that it will be appreciated by customers, we'll find ways to do that.\nTimothy Horan: Thank you.\nJud Henry: All right. I think we've got time for one final question, operator?\nOperator: And that question comes from Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGregory Williams: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question is just on the industry as a whole. It's the third carrier to report this week and showing some strength here. In your postpaid add guidance, I'm just curious to what degree do you expect the industry to soften up in 2024? Is it sort of the same level of softening you saw in 2023? Second question is just on capital allocation. Just curious how sacrosanct is your buyback if I think about, say, fiber M&A materializing and your thinking rates could potentially come down over time, would you consider cutting the buyback for M&A? Or again, is it sacrosanct and you consider levering up and keeping the buyback? Just curious to hear your thoughts. Thank you.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. In the context of the guide for the industry as a whole, we do expect some moderation year-over-year, probably a little bit more moderation in our expectation than what you saw in '22 to '23. But look we look at it from a number of scenarios and kind of give a range. And our job is to within whatever happens in there, to continue to be the share-taking leader. And when we see accretive opportunities to go above and beyond, much like we did in Q4 and all of 2023, we'll deliver on those. So that's kind of what we look to and work within. In terms of capital, I mean, we talk about fiber and all of that. If you recall, what we said is we thought it was the right time and a prudent thing to do in the rate environment and what we saw to delever a little bit more rapidly to the 2.5 point by the end of 2024. We're there at the end of 2023, but there are some puts and takes in terms of timing of payments, for example, with respect to Columbia Capital, but it was the right thing to do there. But even within that, which allowed that envelope that we've announced of share buybacks and dividends, there was some room for investment. And so we'll look within there. But, the capital allocation methodology that we look at is the same it's always been and will continue to be. What are the highest value creating opportunities that we can see as a management team, investing in the network, investing in growth of the core business, the adjacent businesses. And then, of course, we'll look at all other things beyond that, whether that's in the fiber space, whether that's the US cellular we'd look at that process and see are there value-creating opportunities. That would be the right thing to do and invest in. But we have a little bit of wiggle room in there in terms of an envelope for investment even within the guide that we gave you.\nMike Sievert: And if it's further comfort, I will tell you, obviously, we're going to be guided by what creates value, and there are no absolutes there. So, but I will tell you, we're not pursuing to the premise of the example in your question, we're not pursuing a big like on-balance sheet transaction in this space. There's no big deal on the horizon that we see that would knock us off our pace. And I think that's important calculus. If something presented itself, it made a lot of sense for shareholders, our jobs to bring it to you. But right now, we don't see it.\nGregory Williams: Got it. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nJud Henry: Thank you, Greg. It's all the time we have today. Really appreciate everybody joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to either the Investor Relations or Media Relations departments. And with that, thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you, Mike. As you can see, our 2023 results highlighted our strong execution and accelerating our merger integration while leveraging our network leadership and fame for value to deliver industry-leading growth in both traditional postpaid and broadband customers. Our Land and Expand strategy also led to industry-leading growth in postpaid account net adds as well as ARPA growth of 1.3%. Before I jump into our guidance, I would also like to take a moment to note a couple of items impacting our Q4 earnings per share. In December of 2023, we issued 48.8 million shares to SoftBank as the 45-day VWAP of our stock price reached the threshold price under the letter agreement from 2020. This obviously increased our share count, which impacted our diluted EPS and as it is treated as if those shares had been issued for the full quarter. We expect that dilution to be more than offset by our ongoing share repurchases in 2024. We also accelerated depreciation on certain technology assets in Q4 and would anticipate a year-over-year increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $500 million to $1 billion in full year 2024, as we continue to modernize our network and technology systems and platforms. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top line and the bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into how we expect that growth to continue in 2024. Starting with customers. We expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5 million and 5.5 million the same starting guidance as last year, reflecting continued focus on profitable growth as we execute our differentiated strategy even while expecting total industry net additions to moderate. This assumes roughly half of postpaid net adds will be phones. And the guidance also assumes the final portion of deactivations of our lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector with most of that impact already having been accelerated into the second half of 2023. As we noted last quarter, we had always anticipated many of these connections, which supported educational institutions through the pandemic would roll off as the emergency connectivity program wound down and things return to normal. Turning to core adjusted EBITDA. We expect it to be between $31.3 billion and $31.9 billion up nearly 9% year-over-year at the midpoint and above the midpoint of our Capital Markets Day guidance for 2024. This is three times the growth rate of peers and a year-over-year dollar increase comparable to what we delivered in 2023 despite no material incremental merger synergy benefits in 2024. Our sustained growth represents the power of our industry-leading service revenue growth, the operating leverage of our profitable growth model and the opportunity to continue to drive operating efficiencies in the business. We would expect slightly different shaping across the quarters now that we are past the integration. For example, we would expect slightly less sequential improvement from Q4 2023 to Q1 of this year than we saw last year as we achieved full run rate synergies in Q4 2023 and no longer have that as an incremental sequential factor as we had in past Q4 to Q1 progressions. We would expect the operating leverage and efficiencies to drive EBITDA this year to build throughout the year, layered against the seasonal trends of the business. We expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in the industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. Our pull forward of CapEx into 2022 and 2023 has provided us with a broad multilayer 5G network on which we can now deploy additional spectrum for capacity across those existing radios without material incremental CapEx required. Our capital-efficient and data-informed customer-driven coverage approach guides us as we continue to enhance and further expand our network. Our expectations for free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs is in the range of $16.3 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up approximately 22% over last year at the midpoint and five times the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization, and this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin multiple percentage points higher than peers. We expect Q1 free cash flow to be approximately 20% of that full year midpoint given several items that fall early in the year. First, we expect Q1 to be the peak CapEx quarter at probably 30% of the full year midpoint of the CapEx guidance I just shared with you. Second, we expect approximately half of the $600 million to $700 million of anticipated full year '24 cash merger-related costs to be in Q1. Third, we have cash severance for workforce actions taken late last year or if the monthly payments to Cogent following the Wireline sale will taper after April. And finally, there are working capital seasonality elements coming off the higher holiday sales period. And finally, as we continue to execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 2% in 2024. Further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023. In closing, we expect '24 to be another year of profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow delivering the highest free cash flow margin in the industry to unlock shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Yes. And Craig, with respect to ARPU, I mean, as we've talked about multiple times, it's very much a mix-driven metric. And on the consumer side, we have seen continued growth in ARPU. Now that's offset with some of the success and tremendous value creation that we've had in enterprise and government. Those are obviously lower ARPU customers with high CLVs, larger ARPAs. And so that's why the focus on one, the customer value differential that we're bringing and our ARPA playbook, we believe is the right way to go, and you can see that demonstrated in what we delivered in 2023 and Q4 from a postpaid service revenue perspective, that's where you're kind of focused in with postpaid ARPU. And frankly, what we see from a service revenue opportunity in 2024 is even larger percentage growth than what we delivered in 2023. So more than the 3.1% full year growth we'll see in '24 despite, of course, some slight ongoing headwinds in wholesale with the offset of TracFone and other carriers. So we couldn't be more excited about this is the right playbook that delivers the most value creation in the industry. Yes. And just housekeeping wise, again, we don't participate in ACP on the postpaid side. We have a little immaterial amount through Metro and the rest, Assurance isn't reported in our subscriber counts and of course, wholesale customers are not either. So that's it with respect to ACP. And on bonus depreciation, look, we're continuing to monitor the developments. And of course, we're very supportive of a tax regime that stimulates investment into the network into US leadership on this front. With regards to '24, we're not anticipating to be a significant cash taxpayer, so it wouldn't impact the guide for 2024. And we'll see where it goes. And of course, as it develops, we could update you later in the year for outer years. All right. Well, Mike, certainly, our long-run aspiration is to continue to see margin expansion in core EBITDA. But much like you see us focus really, the primary focus here is to continue to be the leader and continue expanding in our ability to deliver free cash flow margin relative to service revenue because that takes out all the noise of relative differentials and how P&Ls are recognized, backhaul, et cetera, and really provides a true color for value creation. And that's where we're already in a leadership position and continue to see more expansion opportunity there. Naturally, Mike, I think what you saw was a little bit of a tapering. We're not going to talk about day-to-day dynamics, but a little bit of a tapering of the share buyback program. As we were nearing that issuance and that trigger point of the SoftBank share. So we're past that now. I think we're confident in our ability to deliver what we've signed up for here, which is another incremental up to $16 billion currently authorized in share buybacks and dividends for 2024 and pacing towards that. You bet. Thanks, Mike. Yes. And on to that, as we said, a big part of this is also the service revenue growth leadership that we anticipate, that we expect to increase in 2024 on a growth basis relative to '23. And then there's, it's across the business. I mean we've made tremendous investments as we are expanding the network as we are expanding distribution. We're reaping some of that. But make no mistake, this is a very scrappy team that's looking at not only just currently where can you continue to drive efficiencies. But how do you take advantage the network modernization of technology modernization of all the buzzwords that you hear these days around AI and other things, but how do you do it in an uncarrier fashion with the customer at the center of it while driving efficiencies out of the business. So we see a lot of room to run here over a multiyear arc on this front. Yes. And I would just add on to that to your point, remember, we're well on our way to our 7 million to 8 million target and hence, some of the moves we made to really optimize value creation. And so I'd probably expect on a quarterly basis, nets might be in the 400,000 range is really what you need to get to that ambition, while creating more value given some of the promotional pricing that we've now pared back. On ACP, I think the important element is we'll see where it goes. But our anticipation with everything that Mike highlighted around the category itself is the outcomes inclusive of should ACP not continue on, is embedded in the core EBITDA guidance range that we provided as well as in our expectation that service revenue growth will be larger in full year '24 than 2023. So that's all embedded in the guidance that we provided. All right. Yes. We haven't specifically guided to that. And remember, we have a little bit of visibility given some of the MPGs, which do trail off with respect to DISH. But I'd expect a continued year-over-year sequential decline, but not a specific guide on wholesale. Absolutely. Yes. So Mint, we anticipate Mint to close in Q1 and that is included in the guide itself. And of course, that will result once it does close and a little bit of service revenue and cost geography changes with minimal net impact to core EBITDA, as we talked about earlier. But all of that including ACP contemplation is considered in the guide that we gave. But it wouldn't be appropriate for me to speak specifically about Mint as we haven't closed yet. Yes. I think that they will come. Obviously, we're still in this period in 2023, we had significant merger-related costs. We're going to have a little bit of merger-related costs in 2024, probably 150 in Q1 and 50 in Q2. But you are going to see us have more and more focus on EPS. And obviously, there was a couple, as I mentioned, a couple of catalysts, including the 48.8 million shares for Q4, but you'll see us more and more focused on EPS. Look, the margin expansion is going to flow into the bottom line. And you'll see us there. We're not quite there yet. Little bit more work to do with the merger-related costs and other things, but it's definitely something we keep an eye on, and it's important. Yes. '24, we'd expect to be generally stable to 2023. And in terms of dynamics, it's going to be the same set of dynamics. You have growth in high-value creating enterprise and government customers. You have growth in tremendously great CLV segment customers like 55+ and Military on the consumer side, which Jon has just seen tremendous success with. You're going to see uptake of our highest tier, highest value rate plans continue at a great clip. And then it just becomes a mix-driven metric. And again, we tend to solve for ARPA and ARPA growth and overall service revenue growth as the focus point. So that's, it's going to be more of the same with regards to ARPU. All right. In the context of the guide for the industry as a whole, we do expect some moderation year-over-year, probably a little bit more moderation in our expectation than what you saw in '22 to '23. But look we look at it from a number of scenarios and kind of give a range. And our job is to within whatever happens in there, to continue to be the share-taking leader. And when we see accretive opportunities to go above and beyond, much like we did in Q4 and all of 2023, we'll deliver on those. So that's kind of what we look to and work within. In terms of capital, I mean, we talk about fiber and all of that. If you recall, what we said is we thought it was the right time and a prudent thing to do in the rate environment and what we saw to delever a little bit more rapidly to the 2.5 point by the end of 2024. We're there at the end of 2023, but there are some puts and takes in terms of timing of payments, for example, with respect to Columbia Capital, but it was the right thing to do there. But even within that, which allowed that envelope that we've announced of share buybacks and dividends, there was some room for investment. And so we'll look within there. But, the capital allocation methodology that we look at is the same it's always been and will continue to be. What are the highest value creating opportunities that we can see as a management team, investing in the network, investing in growth of the core business, the adjacent businesses. And then, of course, we'll look at all other things beyond that, whether that's in the fiber space, whether that's the US cellular we'd look at that process and see are there value-creating opportunities. That would be the right thing to do and invest in. But we have a little bit of wiggle room in there in terms of an envelope for investment even within the guide that we gave you."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks, Jud. Welcome, everybody. As you can see, if you're viewing online, I'm here with a good cross-section of our senior team once again. We're coming to you today from Bellevue, Washington and looking forward to a great discussion. But first, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on a historic year for T-Mobile and the exciting momentum that we bring into 2024. '23 was another year for T-Mobile of industry-leading growth in both customers and key financials, including all-time record results across many metrics. It was also a year where T-Mobile became established as the overall network leader. Built on our extensive advantages in 5G. And it was the year that we effectively completed the biggest arguably the most successful telecommunications merger integration in the world, delivering synergies bigger and faster than even our own ambitious goals and doing it while also accelerating 5G investment in this country to the benefit of consumers and businesses. Our remarkably consistent, best value best network strategy, delivered industry-leading postpaid phone net additions of 3.1 million in 2023. This was driven by our highest postpaid phone gross adds in company history, up 2% for the year and up 6% in Q4. And by our lowest postpaid phone churn in company history for the year. Our net adds essentially matched our great results from '22 despite industry postpaid phone net adds decreasing year-over-year. You know what that means? It means that our unique formula enabled us to take a higher share of postpaid phone net adds than a year ago. In fact, '23 was our highest share of postpaid phone net adds since the merger, showing the ongoing durability of our differentiated strategy. And we finished the year on a high note, with Q4 postpaid phone net adds of 934,000 highest in the industry by a wide margin, and we did it with rising ARPA, up almost 2% delivering industry-leading growth in postpaid service revenue and core EBITDA in Q4 while also nearly doubling our adjusted free cash flow. Let's talk about Broadband. We added over 2.1 million customers in '23, our biggest growth year yet with more net new customers than the other largest providers combined, as our product just continues to resonate in the market. And we finished strong with 541,000 nets in Q4, making us one of the largest ISPs in the nation with 4.8 million customers and counting at year-end. At T-Mobile, our network is the key enabler of our growth, not only for the success that we've had to date, but also for years to come. I predicted years ago that our well-established 5G leadership would eventually translate into overall network leadership, and that was proven loud and clear in 2023. By leading third parties like Ookla and OpenSignal, time and again, with T-Mobile sweeping every category of their test for overall network performance. Listen, it boils down to this. T-Mobile has the broadest and the deepest and the most advanced 5G network in the US today. And we have the assets and capabilities to further extend our network leadership in '24 and beyond. Okay. One final network point, we recently celebrated a pivotal moment in our ground-breaking alliance with SpaceX. By kicking off testing of direct satellite to cellular communications, our teams are really excited about what's coming. Let me just remind you of one thing. Our network leadership still isn't yet fully recognized by millions of network seekers who are still potential future customers for T-Mobile. And yet that same network leadership is already driving our strong win share, particularly in underpenetrated areas like enterprise and government and also in smaller markets and rural areas in our consumer business. Let me just double-click on that growth momentum. T-Mobile for Business, delivered the highest postpaid phone net adds in company history in 2023. And we exited the year with great momentum, with Q4 being our highest quarterly net adds ever. Meanwhile, in our Consumer Group, we continued to grow our share of households, both in smaller markets and rural areas where we are well on our way to our 2025 targets and even in the top 100 markets, where we grew our share year-over-year on the strength of our network and our compelling value proposition. We're executing our balanced growth playbook with great and consistent success. And the best part is we still have a lot of room to run. All of this added up to delivering the highest consolidated service revenue growth in the industry in '23. And it was an industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. On that all-important postpaid service revenue metric, we delivered 6% growth in 2023, way above our next closest competitor. That growth led to core adjusted EBITDA growth of over 10% and free cash flow growth of nearly 80%. All of this enables our substantial stockholder return model, which has returned $17 billion to stockholders so far through the end of '23, including our first-ever quarterly dividend in Q4. Now Peter will share our guidance with you in a moment. But the short version is this. We see continued strong customer and revenue growth, translating into rapid growth in cash flows in 2024 and beyond, and supporting our ambitious plans for shareholder returns that we've already shared with you. Before I wrap up, because this is a year-end report, I want to touch on some of the ways we're building a connected world where everyone can thrive. We believe reliable and affordable wireless and internet service is a necessity for all in today's highly connected and digital world. And that's why we are so proud to have connected nearly 6 million students. And provided $6.4 billion in products and services so far under our flagship initiative Project 10Million and our other education initiatives. We've also partnered with Welcome.US to provide service through Metro by T-Mobile to refugees entering the US as part of a multiyear commitment of 200,000 lines. It is difficult to imagine restarting a new life in a new country, without the connectivity that most of us take for granted. We are also working hard to create a more sustainable future, and we are proud to be the first US wireless provider to commit to achieving net zero emissions across our entire carbon footprint by 2040 using SBTi's net-zero standard. All right. Let me just wrap up with why I am so excited about what's ahead. We are now entering a period of tremendous value creation at T-Mobile, driven by ongoing growth leadership and having -- and by having completed both a historic merger and a massive 5G network build that are foundational to unlocking the cash flow potential of this business. Our network is now a differentiated competitive advantage that complements our well-established value leadership. This unique and powerful formula means that our significant growth and value creation opportunities only continue to scale, and they have lots of room to run. As we enter 2024 with momentum, I could not be more proud of this team and of our employees who remind us every day that it's better over here at T-Mobile. All right, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights as well as our 2024 guidance. Okay. Let's start with smaller markets and rural areas. Jon, why don't you jump in? Absolutely. Great, Jon. And also on Fixed Wireless, the product is just really resonating. Maybe Mike, you can say what, some of the things that we're doing is to respond to this ongoing growth and the acceptance of the product in the marketplace. And then finally, Simon and not to steal your thunder off just to make the short version. We haven't drawn any new conclusions versus what we previously told you about possible models. Beyond this initial capital light model that we have for high-speed Internet. As you know, our forecast all along have said that model takes us to 7 million to 8 million subscribers. We're well on our way. We'll monitor that as we get closer. And we got a lot of time left. So stay tuned if we're able to provide you with an update on that in the future, but no update today. All right, Simon. Hi, Craig. Thanks, Craig. A couple of things. First of all, you heard Peter guide a confident guide on 2% growth in ARPA on the year. And that's terrific to see. And obviously, there's this ongoing trend that customers who buy T-Mobile can't get enough of it, and they're moving up our rate card. And that's great to see. So we're in a great spot. And before I say more about what opportunities we might see, I'll remind everybody listening that we're in an era of unprecedented value that consumers and businesses are realizing from this category generally. I've mentioned previously that typically today across the category, not just at T-Mobile, customers are getting three times more data than just five years ago. And at four times greater speeds industry-wide than five years ago. So there's tremendous value being given to customers in this category and if there are ways for us to find optimizations in terms of how we deliver that enormous value so that we can be more competitive and more efficient at how we operate including looking in our rate card and looking at our rate plans and looking at our policies and procedures, we'll find those opportunities. Q4, we took some of those opportunities. We found a more efficient way to handle auto pay discounts with our customers and fully put that through the base throughout Q4, and that's an important optimization. Right now, taking a lead from Netflix as they've changed their portfolio, we've made changes to the Netflix benefits that we give, which have been well accepted by customers. So there's a theme here. We may find optimizations, but we will be guided by a couple of things. One, what customers accept and appreciate because that's really important. And number two, we have no intentions of sacrificing our brand position as the value leader in terms of what you get for what you pay in this marketplace. That's always been a differentiator for us, and we will defend that jealously. But I'd tell you, there's opportunities that could be there in an era of unprecedented value being seen by consumers and businesses. And if we can take those and meet those guidelines that I've laid out, we'll do so. I'll start on ACP, and I hand it to Peter to finish on ACP and take the bonus depreciation question. When it comes to the number of subscribers in our reported base, it's substantially none. There's a very, very small amount of Metro customers, and that's it. So it's constrained to our Assurance Wireless business, which is not reported as subscribers and to our wholesale business. And as it relates to ACP and what's happening to it, obviously, that's in motion. You may have noticed that our EBITDA guide was a tiny bit wider this year. I would tell you that all the outcomes that we see for ACP are fully embedded in the guide that we gave you on EBITDA. And look, our risk profile around ACP is a little different than, say, a broadband company. They went very big into it, committed lots of customers and numbers to it. And also, I think one subscribers that may or may not stick around. Mobile is different. Mobile is a product that customers will keep. And if they lose that discount our job, and I think our team is up to the task is to go win them over with our high-value offers. And we have some of the best brands in the space with incredible value propositions. And as other wireless providers see the same thing happen, we will get after it and position our brands as the place that those people land. So there's a risk profile around it for T-Mobile, but I think much smaller than with other players, and it's fully embedded in the guidance. That's that, I'll let Peter pick up there as well as talk about the bonus depreciation. Hi, John. I'll start on churn and maybe hand it to Mike on competition. Churn was up 9 basis points sequentially. And if you look at the last several years since we completed the merger from Q3 to Q4, the average is 10 basis points sequentially. So it's right in line, maybe even a little better than past sequential moves. Our business tends to be seasonal, with Q4 being a higher time period of churn. And that being said I was really pleased with getting the 9 basis points given some of the optimizations that were fully implemented in Q4 that I mentioned in response to an earlier question. Look, there's no question in my mind that we are on a journey towards the best churn in this industry. And that's because we have the best value and the best network and a history of being able to treat customers with respect. And so we'll find that journey making its way. '24 is going to be an interesting year because as I mentioned earlier, there are optimizations across the board that we may find are in our best interest to take. As long as they don't put at risk, our superior value proposition as long as there are things that will be well accepted or even appreciated by customers. And so I can't give you specifics on the guide. I can tell you that with this churn, 9 basis points higher sequentially, we delivered a big beat in postpaid net additions on phones of 934,000, bigger than we guided even during the middle of the quarter. And so we're very comfortable with the formula. And we're comfortable with the formula in part because competition has been remarkably consistent. I'll let Mike talk about what we're seeing. You bet. Thanks, John. All right. Let's start with core EBITDA and core EBIDTA margin. Peter? Great. And you obviously saw us in Q4 take some investments to make sure that we could have a beat on customers and revenues, and that's just helping with our confident guide in 2024. So when we see opportunities like that, we take them. We've talked with you many times about that in the past. Second question was about share buybacks. What happened in Q4? There was a little bit of a slowdown. What are we seeing now? What do people expect? Yes, I'll just start by kind of reminding everybody that, as Peter already pointed out, the '24 guide at the midpoint is higher than our earlier Capital Markets Day guide, and it's 9% year-over-year, which is three times the expectation of our peers. And so it's really terrific to see this business scaling and without the incremental year-over-year benefit of big expansions and synergies, that's mostly behind us almost entirely. And so that's really great to see. It obviously comes from ongoing progression of valuable customers, some of the best customers with the best payment records in the industry as well as efficiencies that we can see in how we run the business. Terrific. Great. Well, let's start with upgrade rates. We don't see big catalysts for change here. Around the edges, there may be some, and we can talk about those. For example, we have a brand-new rate plan called Go5G Next, which offers upgrade benefits, could change it on the margin and other things. But generally speaking, people are keeping their phones longer. And they're doing that because the phones are very expensive, and they're very capable. For our customers, 75% of them have 5G phones that are able to take advantage of the vast majority of our advanced network capabilities that we already have implemented. And so those kinds of things are a great position to be in, and I don't think there's a big catalyst for change in 2024. As it relates to SpaceX, yes, we're really excited about it. And way back when we announced it, we talked about the capabilities, starting with text messaging, peer-to-peer text messaging, the ability to reach people if you can see the sky. We expected to cover the Continental US big parts of Alaska, big parts of the world's oceans and be able to allow you to stay in connection with your loved ones. That will progress into picture messaging and eventually talk and other capabilities. And the beta we expect if things go well, we should have these capabilities in customer hands this year. As it relates to who it appeals to, look, anybody that finds themselves on occasion in one of the 500,000 square miles in this country, not covered by any of the networks. And that's most of us. And so there's something about the peace of mind of knowing that if you can see the sky, generally speaking, you're connected. And that's our dream. That's the aspiration that we set out when we announced this partnership, and it's great to have the first satellites in the sky. You bet. Okay. Great. We don't know whether it will be material. But we do know that, and are reasonably confident that it's fully embedded within all of the outcomes that we provided in our guidance range to you. But let's start with Fixed Wireless and go to Mike. And then Mike, if you want to transition to what we're seeing with ACP and Peter will probably pile on. And that's obviously factored into the guidance that we've provided. And the shareholder return program that we have underway really helps with it overall. Despite this dilution event that we saw, the overall trend is anti-dilution as we retire shares through the program. So it's a good trend to be on. It's kind of neat to see that if you just listen to that, that essentially our whole business effort has just kind of grown up. And we're now competing to solve really important organizational problems for enterprise and government. With the corner office. And that's just a different place for us. And it's been interesting to see you've had to retool all the skills and the capabilities and the solutions. And now we have this business that is just breaking records. So there's a lot of room to run because we're at the very beginning, I think, of CIOs and organizational leaders rethinking their connectivity in the era of AI. And when they start to assess who's best positioned in this era to provide reliable, secure connectivity with dedicated spectrum, it's T-Mobile. And so it's just, we're lucky to be in this moment at the very moment that everyone is rethinking everything in technology thanks to the advent of AI and related technologies. So it's a great place to be. Okay. Sounds good. I'll take the first one and then maybe hand it to Peter. As we said in response to an earlier question, it's kind of too early to tell what's going to happen as we start to get towards that initial goal for our Fixed Wireless business of 7 million to 8 million subscribers, as Jon reminded us. And right now, we want to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with a fantastic product at a fair price, and we start to ease our way towards that moment. But we also don't know, as we said earlier, whether that's really the final destination or not, whether or not there may be other models that allow us to extend past that. And so look, we'll learn more with each passing quarter. But I think the moves we've made that Mike outlined, I think, well, a few minutes ago, this is the right time for them to make sure that we're serving mainstream customers with our great product. We're meeting the demand appropriately and that we're correctly monetizing it so that we're able to continue serving customers in the best possible way. So I'm really happy with where we are. The demand for this product based on the quality of the product has just been phenomenal. And I think a lot of it now is word of mouth. Because that's what happens when you get 4.8 million customers using this product every day at very high nearly the best in the industry, Net Promoter Scores. Well, what they do, they tell other people that they've discovered something great. And that just feeds on itself. So that's a really good place to be. Secondly, unpacking ARPU? And is there anything different in the dynamics for '24 versus '23? You bet. Hopefully, you can tell we're trying to get to absolutely as many questions as we can as time so let's keep moving. Well, first, on overall capacity, it's a good opportunity to turn it to Ulf and maybe you can say what we're seeing now that we're substantially complete with the initial build. As it relates to your specific question on the 15 times, I actually don't have the answer at my fingertips. So I'm going to look into that. I can tell you that when we made that estimate, what we had in mind were the commercial results that we have delivered in space, being able to see phone usage grow the way it has grown at T-Mobile, it's now more than triple what it was five years ago. Four times the speed and then some and being able to handle this massive home broadband business on top as well as all the growth that we see in enterprise. So as we laid out this network, that way back in 2018 and planned it, we have met every single expectation that we laid out there, including some stringent commitments that we made to the FCC as part of the merger process and just completed a massive nationwide drive in order to be able to make those goals. So I would be surprised if it's anything other than the 15x has been achieved, but I'll have to double check on that. As it relates to the F1, it's fascinating, you hear Ulf talking about Network Slicing and what it's doing for people. And there have been lots of applications. We talk about F1 because it's very public and it's going to be great case study for all of our executive briefing center visits, et cetera. But there have been lots of these now. And look, your previous options were either string wires everywhere, which was not ideal or rely on Wi-Fi. Where you have no control over the radio spectrum and it's a best efforts service with a shared spectrum. And so this is a breakthrough for organizations that they need mission-critical distributed connectivity. Network slicing on 5G is a breakthrough solution for that. We're going to see lots of applications like powering the commercial operations at F1, where it's the perfect solution. I mean this industry gives remarkable value, and we've been talking about that a little bit during the call. As it relates to T-Mobile, we're always looking for ways that we can serve customers better and make sure that we build a profitable business around that. And we have to do that smartly so that we defend and extend our fame as the value provider because that's so important, and we have lower costs. So that should be defensible over the long haul as evidenced by things like a lower debt structure and lower cost to service that debt than anybody else in the industry. So it's a defensible place, but we have to defend it by making smart decisions. And we have the best network, and that should allow us to find the right optimization to be able to serve customers better. We can't give you predictions over the long haul other than to say that in 2024, we see opportunities, and that's why we've got a confident guide in 2% year-over-year gain in ARPA. And over the long haul, we'll see what happens. But I will tell you that I'm pleased that customers are getting such incredible value from this category, and that certainly does open up opportunities for us to make sure for T-Mobile that if there are opportunities for us to monetize that in smart ways that it will be appreciated by customers, we'll find ways to do that. And if it's further comfort, I will tell you, obviously, we're going to be guided by what creates value, and there are no absolutes there. So, but I will tell you, we're not pursuing to the premise of the example in your question, we're not pursuing a big like on-balance sheet transaction in this space. There's no big deal on the horizon that we see that would knock us off our pace. And I think that's important calculus. If something presented itself, it made a lot of sense for shareholders, our jobs to bring it to you. But right now, we don't see it. You bet."

            "content": "Yes, you bet. Hi, Simon. I'm just delighted with what's happening here in smaller markets and rural areas. I've been talking to all of you about this since our Analyst Day event back in March of 2021. And back in that time, we were at a 13% share of household position. And we set this incredibly ambitious goal to get to 20% by the end of the year 2025 across the entire segment, which, by the way, is 140 million people, 40% of the US, about 50 million households. And I updated you last time when we, during our Q3 earnings report about our share-taking progress in those markets and some of the really good results that we're seeing. And I'm pleased to tell you that, we've now arrived at a share of household position in smaller markets of rural areas of about 17.5%. And so I'm really, really pleased by that. And the last time I talked to you about this was about nine months ago, and we were at 16.5%, so a full percentage point since that time. And when you look at what we're doing with the 5G network build that Ulf and his team have been doing the distribution expansion and bringing this incredible marketing infrastructure out to smaller markets and rural areas. People are just loving what we're doing. We're having a lot of fun doing it. And I got to tell you that it looks like we're really in a place where we can achieve that 20% goal by 2025 based on where we are, but I'm really more excited and I think the more compelling opportunity is what we can do beyond the 20%. I don't have anything to tell you about right here right now about that. But I tell you, I'm getting really excited about what we can be doing beyond this 20% goal as you think about our continued velocity in these particular markets."

            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yes. I mean one thing that is kind of just amazing when you look back at it, we've essentially been in the market with our Fixed Wireless product for two years. And in two years, we've gone from a launch product to what you saw at the end of Q4, which is nearly 5 million customers on Fixed Wireless, making us one of the largest ISPs in America with a product that still leads versus every other industry in customer satisfaction. So we're really proud of what's been built here and continued momentum. We saw gross adds this year, the highest they've ever been. So we have a lot of demand for this product. And so one of the decisions you saw us recently take was reverting back to our standard pricing in our Fixed Wireless product. We've been so moving away from our promotional pricing that we've been on for the last two years to our standard pricing which we put into market earlier this month. And we think that still offers the best value inside the broadband business and the best experience as demonstrated by the NPS scores that I just talked about. So we think there's still room to grow in HSI. We still, with a 5 million customer base still runway in front of us to grow both in new customers but also in services. We think having a 5 million customer broadband base gives us the opportunity to bring more services into the home, which the team is actively exploring. Yes. This has always been a really competitive environment in the industry and dynamic and competitive. And honestly, that's the way we like it. For us, when there's lots of competition and customers are looking around shopping, T-Mobile ends up being the net winner. And you see that both in '23 with, and in Q4, specifically with T-Mobile having the highest share of net adds. And you saw it consistently throughout the year with the account growth that T-Mobile posted, which was highest by far in the industry. What we saw in Q4, I would describe as generally consistent with what we saw last year. Offers were pretty much the same, very aggressive, but pretty consistent with previous year. I think what's been different is the way that T-Mobile or what's evolved, maybe I should say, is the way that T-Mobile competes. Mike and Peter both talked about this value proposition we have of best value, which historically has always been the thing that T-Mobile has owned. And then more recently developed the best network. And those two things together really creates a unique value proposition that's unmatched in the industry and is resonating with customers. You saw it again in Q4, and you continue to see us enhance it as we did this year with the launch of the Go5G plans the launch of Phone Freedom, which in a shopping time like Q4 as customers are looking to upgrade, we think, really resonated, and you saw it in the net add performance. Yes. I think on the Fixed Wireless side, like I mentioned earlier, we've seen steady demand for this product since it's launched. And a lot of the things that you mentioned are absolutely true. Like our execution has gotten better. We have built more stores. So like we've got distribution closer to customers in areas like rural areas. There's more awareness of the product, both generally and the overall market but also within our base. All of those things certainly have been factors. I think the other big thing that's been a factor is churn. Because remember, the net additions are the difference between gross adds and the number of customers that churn. And we've seen a steady improvement with churn with HSI year-over-year, really across every single 10-year cohort. We knew that churn would come down as our base aged and got into later cohorts, which we see the later cohorts of customers in this churn at a rate that's pretty comparable with cable. We knew that churn would come down as our base age. But what's really exciting is as the product has improved itself and as the experience has improved and frankly, as our execution has improved, even the early 10-year cohort churn has started to reduce, and we've seen that consistently throughout the year."

            "name": "Callie Field",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thanks, Janice. And let me just tell you we're in a different phase in our business? Last year, my leaders transformed the talent and activity of our sales team. And we've upgraded our product portfolio with solutions like T-SIM Secure and our connected workplace managed services with Cisco Meraki that we just announced yesterday. We've moved from transacting with lower-level procurement employees to sitting at the table with CIOs as their trusted partners for connectivity solutions. And also, business customers, as we talked about before, they test our network before purchasing. And what they find is the most modern, the most distributed nationwide tri-band 5G stand-alone commercially available for slicing network and they've determined its superiority. And all of this translates right back into our core business. So we delivered on our highest quarter and year ever in business postpaid phone net additions and gross adds. And our results outperformed our benchmark competitor once again. In enterprise, we delivered our highest win share rate with postpaid phone net additions. And our results allowed us to bring on new customers like SalesForce and REI and deepen our relationships with Delta, DoorDash Meta, UPS, just to name a few. And in the public sector, we drove double-digit growth in our new public safety accounts, especially with first responders who recognize that we at T-Mobile provide a more secure, prioritized connection over a faster and larger network. We continue to grow and compete successfully in small businesses, best quarter and year yet and saw positive porting trends versus both of our principal competitors in the third consecutive quarter in a row. So we're bringing in, as Peter mentioned earlier, both highly profitable customers with attractive CLVs, and as it relates to revenue outside of phones, we also saw some key wins in our Advanced Network solutions this past quarter with Formula 1 in Las Vegas, where we successfully demonstrated our commercial application of network slicing with 230 points of sale that was incredible, Ulf, and also signed a deal with PJM Americas, where we're the official 5G innovation partner enhancing how players and fans both experience the game. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight on what we're seeing."

            "name": "Ulf Ewaldsson",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks a lot, Mike, and thanks for the question. Well, overall, the network capacity on this fantastic network is outstanding and keeps increasing on 5G as we are pivoting over frequency from our LTE customers over to 5G. And we keep doing that all the time. That's why we can stay ahead of the curve, both with our HSI customers being inside that mobile umbrella, but also making sure that we have enough capacity to grow for all the traffic growth on the network. And as Mike alluded to earlier, we just see an increasing usage. People use more and more of the goodness that we provide. I'll also say that this is across our entire geography. We have to remember that our network is much, much larger in size than 5G than any of our competitor in this country. We have on our 5G coverage more than twice the area of our closest competitor on our ultra-capacity, which is what provides all that capacity. When it comes to the second question, which was around network slicing in Las Vegas, and as Callie alluded to, this was a true success story. We were the only operator in the world or in the country that could provide a true beta version because of our stand-alone core that we have in this network -- of network slicing. In other words, we can program our network to make sure that services work while all the other services and serving all the other customers on the network at the same time. We were able to provide network slicing during the start of the race, which means that we could both make sure that all those points of sales had full service to everything they were doing at the same time as hundred thousand customers per day were using our network during that start the rate, watching their apps, doing all the activities that they will be doing. This has almost never happened in Formula 1 history. It's normally very congested, very difficult to do anything when so many customers are accessing the network at the same time. And that's what network slicing was proving to do in Las Vegas, and it's just started early to come. We're going to roll these kind of things out to much more events in the future."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that said, let me kick it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. If you're watching on our webcast, you can see we're coming to you from New York City and, here with several members of my senior leadership team, and we're looking forward to discussing another quarter of great results. Our strategy to deliver the best network coupled with the best value and the best customer experience has remained remarkably consistent. And our Q3 results again show how well that strategy is working with another quarter of industry leading customer and financial growth. I want to thank our amazing team nationwide. We have tackled a lot of change together recently to position our company for success in the future, and it hasn't all been easy. But this team showed once again what loving customers looks like and how that simple philosophy translates into success. I'm sure you've seen the numbers already. So I'm going to spare you the greatest hits album of all the quarterly results and just a couple of things with a few comments so that we can get [Technical Difficulty] First, as we announced yesterday, I am so proud of our network team for reaching our audacious goal of 300 million people covered with dedicated mid-band 5G over two months ahead of our year-end target. We announced this goal nearly three years ago. And then we got to work and got it done. And to this day, no one else in our industry has stated any plans to match it at any time in the future. I know it may get confusing with others celebrating their C-band deployments, which might have a casual observer. Believe, our network lead could be narrowing, but the opposite is true. In fact, even after their C-band deployments, according to Ookla, T-Mobile's nationwide median speeds were double the next competitor's speeds in September -- double in September. And our mid-band 5G square mile coverage is also double the next closest competitor, meaning, others still have a lot of wood to chop beyond just population dense pockets to ever reach the expansive geography where T-Mobile is today. And we have more spectrum dedicated to 5G than anyone else. Before we've even begun to deploy our C-band, our 3.45 GHz spectrum, or Auction 108 2.5 GHz licenses, let alone re-farming our AWS. Listen, we started the 5G era two years ahead of the competition and today we remain two or more years ahead. And I predict that two years from now, we still will be. What all this translates to is a superior customer experience. We're rapidly putting our spectrum resources to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. And we're doing it with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Most exciting part, many prospective customers are only just beginning to take notice that T-Mobile is the overall network lever, leaving lots of growth runway ahead. And we're also expanding on our long-held fame for delivering the best value. Our latest Un-Carrier move is freeing customers locked into three-year contracts, and our new Go 5G rate plans are delivering the most feature-rich options in wireless. Phone freedom has turned out to be one of our most exciting Un-Carrier moves ever, and it continues to bring high-quality switchers to T-Mobile, as you could see in our industry-leading postpaid account growth. We're also executing on our ARPA revenue growth strategy, posting another strong quarter well over plus 1% versus a year ago and revenue per account on the strength of Go 5G plus and multiple products. Some have asked, if our new higher value rate plans are most popular with consumers, then why isn't ARPU growing faster too? And I'll point out that consumer ARPU does continue to grow even after offsets from growing segments like 55+ and military. And consumer overall is being partially offset by profitable growth in the enterprise space at somewhat lower ARPUs, but attractive CLVs, a development that's contributing well to our financial growth. And we're doing all of this within a backdrop of a wireless industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows, while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. In fact, this industry produces cash flow and EBITDA much higher than five years ago, while at the same time, customers are enjoying 3 times more data at 4 times higher speeds, while paying just a fraction of the price per unit consumed versus before. And that's before factoring in the expanded device promotions now routinely offered. A vibrant profitable business delivering rapidly improving network service and value. That's the win-win 5G dividend nobody's talking about, and it helps to showcase why T-Mobile's 5G leadership is so important. This is certainly true in T-Mobile for Business, where we have the highest ever account net ads overall and our highest ever postpaid nets in enterprise based on the strength of our 5G enabled solutions. Consumers are also choosing T-Mobile above all others. Prime network seekers in the top 100 markets increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. And for the first time ever, T-Mobile also won the highest share of switchers in smaller markets and rural areas in Q3. Broadband also had another strong quarter. We now serve over 4.2 million customers who are enjoying a great experience with net promoter scores that remain more than 30 points higher than cable, with churn improving year-over-year as well. We remain very much on pace for our longer term goals with 5G broadband. Overall, our customer growth strategy remains differentiated and durable, resulting in industry leading service revenue growth both at the total company level and at the postpaid service revenue level where most of the value is created, which grew more than 6% or more than 1.5 times the growth rate of peers. That top-line leadership coupled with our synergy realization and focus on cost efficiencies drove double-digit growth and core adjusted EBITDA with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry. This allows us to not only raise our guidance for this year again, it also gives us excitement and confidence in the future. With our significant growth opportunities continuing to scale, with lots of room to run, it sets us up for sustained leadership in both customer and service revenue growth as we look ahead. And we see opportunities amid the rapidly changing technology landscape as well, all across our business, to drive further revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow growth that will allow us to fund our growth investments in our customers and network, as well as provide the potential for substantial ongoing shareholder returns. This amazing customer-loving team continues to perform beautifully with so much exciting potential ahead, showing why it's not just a tagline when we say that for customers, employees, and investors alike, it's better over here at T-Mobile. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance.\nPeter Osvaldik: All right. Thanks, Mike. Our ongoing delivery of best-in-class customer and financial growth quarter after quarter enables us to increase our guidance once again. So let's jump into the details. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, up 50,000 at the midpoint. This reflects continued progress across all our core growth initiatives, partially offset by the deactivation of lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector, the largest of which arose during Q3. As you know, our ability to uniquely solve customer pain points led to significant connection growth in the educational sector during the pandemic, supporting the rapid need for remote learning solutions. As things are increasingly returning to normal, we had anticipated many of these connections to roll off in 2023 and do not expect the deactivation of these educational connections to have any material impact to service revenue looking forward. Included in the 5.7 million to 5.9 million is our expectation of approximately 3 million postpaid phone net additions for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher postpaid phone net ads and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $29 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up over 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, fueled by higher service revenues and synergies, and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. Now with the merger integration now substantially behind us, we will discontinue reporting synergies separately from overall business results going forward. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for 2023 as they have under run the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities which include payments for merger related costs are now expected to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, delivering our network milestones ahead of schedule at a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry. The higher operating cash flows not only fund the increased CapEx, but also allow for a slight increase to free cash flow, now expected to be between $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. Not only is this up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, but also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. Consistent with the entire year, the updated free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. Turning to income taxes, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than 1% as we continue to expand our account relationships as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. In closing, our differentiated and profitable growth strategy continues to deliver industry-leading growth and service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow along with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry to unlock shareholder value. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A.\nJud Henry: All right, let's get to your questions. You can ask a question via phone by pressing one followed by four or via XTwitter by sending a tweet to @T-MobileIR or at Mike Sievert using #TMUS. We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. Two question if I can. First of all, the comments on the rapid share gains in the rural markets were sort of new this quarter. Mike, anything you could tell us about sort of where you are and sort of how much room you have to go to penetrate these markets. And then secondly, maybe for Peter, there was a comment in the 10-Q about the workforce reduction and the fact that it would drive OpEx down on a year-over-year basis in 2024. I guess two parts there. One, are there any way you could quantify the OpEx reduction and are there other factors involved that are potentially allowing you to see that OpEx reduction on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay, John. Let's start with Jon Freier who maybe can give a little color on what we're seeing in smaller markets and rural areas. As you heard in my prepared remarks, this is a huge milestone, because T-Mobile achieved leadership in share of switchers for the first time ever across the entirety of what we call smaller markets and rural areas, which is about 40% of the country.\nJon Freier: Yes, you bet, Mike. So yes, just to pick it up on that, 40% of the country, everything outside of the top 100 markets is how we define smaller markets and rural areas. It's about 140 million people, 50 million households, and again, 40% of the market. And we just could not be more delighted. I've been talking to you about this for a couple of years now relative to our ambitions in smaller markets and rural areas and bringing real 5G. When you think about a lot of the places that we're playing, we're bringing the only 5G network into town. And given the announcement that we just made a couple of days ago around 5G Ultra Capacity now bringing that to 300 million people across the entire country. So it's a huge opportunity when we bring the network, we're bringing the distribution, we're bringing our marketing and our special sauce relative to our value proposition and more choice to smaller markets and rural areas. It's been fantastic. It's a huge milestone for us to be across all these markets now the leader of share of port ends. We're not playing in all the markets, just as a reminder. It's about 70% of the markets that we're playing in. We're not even playing across all the markets. And even with that, now we're the share leader in terms of share taker, I should say, not necessarily share leader, but share taker. And I mentioned this a few times. We've had a dedicated team as a big part of our success in smaller markets, rural areas, really getting at to this with our dedicated team that's focused on driving the kind of commercial success that we're looking for. And our overall ambition is unchanged. And we're right on track to hit 20% share of household by the end of 2025.\nMike Sievert: You take these last couple of quarters and drag them right, we'll be the share leader soon enough in smaller markets and rural areas. Peter, any comments on OpEx for 2024? Why don't you just go ahead and roll out the guidance for 2020?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, exactly. [Multiple Speakers] Yes, so I got up too early to roll out 2024 guidance, that's for sure. But in your question of workforce transformation. Look, I think Mike touched upon it at the beginning, and you saw us comment around this before. This is really about a tough set of actions, but as we got through the balance of the integration, we had to make some changes. That's what this team does. It looks around corners and it says, we need to make sure we create clarity in the operating of this organization, bring that entrepreneurial spirit back and make sure that we're looking at what are the headwinds and what are the tailwinds. As we think about what we laid out at Analyst Day, which seems like so long ago with respect to 2024 and what we were going to do there. A lot in the world has changed, but it's a set of all of these tailwinds and actions that we've created that still gives us confidence that we think, certainly from a core EBITDA perspective, again, I'm not going to roll out all the 2024 guidance, but we're going to come right in there in the middle of the range. And these are the kind of actions that are necessary to create that opportunity and keep bringing the ability to invest in customers and the network and the business as we are.\nMike Sievert: I was kind of kidding, but you did roll out the guidance. Okay. That's pretty good. It is remarkable that we did this Analyst Day years ago, I think, early in 2021 and laid out several years of expectations. And as we sit here today, knocking on 2024, we're able to outlook a year next year that looks just like we had anticipated, right down the middle. And that's something that I'm particularly proud of, given that it's not at all like we thought. I mean, it's really different than we thought. And yet we make course corrections as we go to keep the promises that we made to you front and center, a vibrant growing business, developing EBITDA and cashflow, and doing breakthrough things for customers and businesses. And that's what's happening. So we couldn't be more excited about next year. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Good morning. Mike, you talked about some of the additional growth opportunities and perhaps you just revisit the fiber [pilot program] (ph) and how that's going, how you're thinking about that? There's been a lot of speculation about different assets. I think you've talked in the past about asset light. And then related to that, fixed wireless expansion and analyzing millimeter wave, overlay solutions and other ways to add capacity, any updates on that. It sounds like you've still got C-band and 3.45 to bring to bear on that. But any color there would be great.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Thanks, Simon. Well, nothing's changed in terms of our philosophy and approach as it relates to broadband. And just to take you back, what we had said still holds, which is, we are conducting all kinds of experiments in the space, including observing our national performance in 5G home broadband, which, if anything, that performance and the resonance of our brand and our team's ability to execute in the space, along with the trials that we're doing in fiber, only bolster our confidence that our brand and our team belong in this market. But nothing has changed in terms of our philosophy. We like this business model, and to the extent we make investments or partnerships in the area, our view is, it should be capital light, generally off balance sheet, et cetera. Speculation, I know is out there. I can't clarify we're not the partner to [JANA] (ph) in the transaction that was rumored a couple weeks ago. Although we remain interested in partnerships like the kinds we have rolled out pilots around and other constructs that are generally capital light, generally off balance sheet. And that's for a reason. We're performing really well and demonstrating through our tests as well as our broad scale performance in 5G home broadband that our brand and our team belong in this space and we can create value. As it relates to new ways to do wireless broadband, you said it at the very end there, and I mentioned in my remarks, Ulf and team, now that they've reached 300 million people with mid-band Ultra Capacity 5G are now setting about the task of deploying all of our spectrum resources to that base. And we're only just beginning. We have the bulk of our 2.5 GHz now rolling out. But our target is to be at 200 megahertz around the end of this year deployed against the 300 million people. And then more room to run next year, because as I said, we have Auction 108 proceeds still pending, we have C-band that we haven't deployed, 3.45, as well as refarming potential from spectrum being used for LTE right now, like AWS. And so lots of room to run as it relates to pouring new capacity into this network. And that means, we right now at a broad scale are not looking at alternatives to that from a wireless standpoint. We use millimeter wave pretty strategically in very dense places and so far that's a great use for it. I will say, as we said last time, so no change, that we remain open minded to whether there are techniques that would allow us to deploy capital specifically for 5G broadband and make a great return for you. But so far, we haven't drawn any conclusions that that's a scalable opportunity for us.\nSimon Flannery: Thanks Mike.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nJud Henry: All right. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of -- pardon me, Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Two if I can. One, Peter can you talk about potential savings from the layoffs in August and will those hit the fourth quarter or should we think of that all next year? And then maybe one for Callie. Can you talk about the contribution of business to subscriber growth numbers and what's the typical ARPU of your business phone lines? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay, let's start with Callie on business. And then we'll come back to another crack at OpEx. So what's going on in business, Cellie?\nCallie Field: Well, thanks Phil for the question. And I'll tell you, as a result of our network leadership and the solutions that are built for today's unique challenges of a CIO, we continue to deliver highly profitable growth. One of our highest postpaid phone net ads and lowest phone churn quarters in history and delivered results once again that outperformed our benchmark competitor. This quarter also we delivered our highest enterprise postpaid net ads ever. So we're seeing growth in all segments, in small business and in enterprise. As for the macro environment, while there's probably a portion that are price sensitive. We know from years of experience that price alone doesn't determine a win with enterprise and government who are uncompromising when it comes to network performance and complete solutions. Solutions like we recently deployed at Boston Children's Hospital, which is the healthcare industry's first ever hybrid 5G network solution for over 18 buildings which is supporting critical applications not only reliable connectivity, but also with security and MDM solutions for doctors to provide telehealth services to their patients. So let me pause there and Mike, see if there's anything else.\nMike Sievert: Yeah, and specifically on ARPU, we said in our prepared remarks, it's somewhat lower than consumer, but highly accretive from a CLV and value creation standpoint. So these are great customers. We are finding, as Callie said, that enterprises are not picking us because we're the lowest price, although we compete ambitiously on price. They're picking us because of the solutions that Callie's team has brought to the market. And that's very helpful from a value creation standpoint for us. So we continually look at the customer lifetime value, net of all the costs to serve these customers, and find that enterprise customers are highly attractive, and therefore contributing to our financial results. And that's why Peter always warns you, ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And we're not solving for it, we're solving for value creation and return on our effort and investment and enterprise is a great place to put our effort and investment.\nPeter Osvaldik: And then Phil with regards to the [indiscernible] crack at OpEx. So again, the actions that we took really ways for us to create tailwind and further fuel the growth of the company. And so I'm not giving specific line item, OpEx guides, all of those actions were then contemplated in the updated guide for 2023 that we gave, and again, kind of the teaser we just gave about 2024 and core EBITDA there.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, guys.\nPeter Osvaldik: You bet.\nJud Henry: All right. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. You guys recently took a price increase for legacy plans and we've heard a bit about -- it certainly drew some unwelcome press, and we've heard a little bit about pulling back from that a little bit. Can you just talk about the kind of response you've had and how you think about industry pricing going forward and the ability to walk some of your ARPUs higher?\nMike Sievert: Yes, of course, Craig. And by the way, that was sort of not very accurately reported. So let me just kind of clear it up. As you guys know, because you follow us so closely, more so than the press. We tend to do tests and pilots of things quite a bit to try to figure out what's the right answer. In this case, we had a test cell to try to understand customer interest in and acceptance of migrating off old legacy rate plans to something that's higher value for them and for us. And we had planned to test and did some training around that. And then it leaked. And it leaked as if it was a broad national thing. And it kind of wasn't. Now, I don't know that we still have to do that test cell, because to your point, we did get plenty of feedback, thanks to the erroneous context of the leak. And I think we've learned that particular test cell isn't something that our customers are going to love. Now, exactly none have rolled out. So even to your question that we recently rolled out, we didn't. We had planned it -- we had planned it as a test cell, and then we aren't doing it. Because I think we got plenty of feedback. But maybe Mike, you can talk about our philosophy on pricing, things we're interested in, what we're hearing from customers, and also what we're seeing with Go 5G Plus and Next.\nMichael Katz: Yes. Maybe I can start with that. Go 5G Plus and Next have been, like we've talked about the last couple cycles, incredible successes for us. And it really starts with the fact that these are hands down the best value in this industry. If you look at all the features that come with those plans, there's hundreds of dollars of value for customers on a monthly basis with the streaming benefits and the in-flight Wi-Fi and roaming benefits are on those plans. But in a time when the market and customers are so focused on device value, there is not a plan in the industry that gives customers more flexibility and more value on device than the Go 5G plans do. And you really saw that in this last iPhone cycle where we really differentiated with the flexibility on upgrade. When the rest of the market is at three years, we had offers for customers that allowed them to upgrade as frequently as one year. Those plans really create the platform for our core pricing strategy, which is, how can we give customers more and more value and allow them to move up our price card because they feel like they're getting something additional from us. So that is the foundation of our core pricing value. As Mike said, we conduct tests and pilots all the time, all the time, and we will continue to do so because we still think there's opportunities both to deliver more value for customers in a bunch of different ways, but also look for opportunities to simplify our overall portfolio. So I would expect to see more of those kinds of tests from us, because it's been a consistent practice throughout the entire un-carrier journey so that we get it right for the experience for our customers.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Although that particular test cell doesn't need to be executed now we remain very interested in rationalizing our legacy rate plans for IT purposes, simplification purposes, revenue realization purposes, customer satisfaction and retention purposes. So we're going to stay at it, but that particular idea will probably do something different. Good, okay.\nCraig Moffett: Can you just comment on just the industry pricing environment overall and what your sense is about the competitive intensity on the rate plan side?\nMike Sievert: Yes, absolutely. In fact, I'll give a broader picture, rate plan and device promotions, which have become a big part of the competitive milieu over the last couple of years. It's intense. It's really competitive. And it's pretty consistent too. I mean, I think it's been consistently competitive all year. And you saw we delivered an incredible Q2 and Q3 in that context. Some of the best performance in our history, the lowest churn ever for a Q2 and for a Q3 in our history. We continue to lead in postpaid net additions and delivered EBITDA performance and outlooks on EBITDA that show that we're monetizing that growth as well. So we're really comfortable in this competitive dynamic and it's stable and consistent. So that's what's going on out there. It's intense. We like it that way. And, I would say, we're entering typically very intense seasonal period around the holidays, and I expect it to be a slog out there just like it is every year.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: All right.\nJud Henry: All right. Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. During your prepared remarks, I think you'd mentioned that your fixed wireless churn has come down. I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit of insight into what's driving that? Maybe broadly speaking, what you've learned about what creates churn and what causes greater levels of retention across that base? And do you think you're getting to a point where churn is getting into a mature run rate or is there still opportunity to keep driving that lower? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Yes, I'd love to take credit for that. I think a lot of it's just the math of the aging of our base. So this product was great when we launched it. And that's because we had made sure it would be great before we took it national. And so, it's generally been pretty consistent. One of the ways you can look at that is the net promoter scores, which have been pretty consistent.\nMichael Katz: Yeah, in fact, leading industry of all kinds of -- different kinds of broadband products. Yes, I think there's two things. One is the one that Mike just said. And we've talked about this previously, that when you have a new broadband business, one that literally has doubled in size year-over-year, that we have many more customers that are brand new customers that churn at a higher rate. That's just the way that the churn curve works on products like these, including wireless. Early 10-year customers churn at a higher rate. And as customers mature and our base matures, we expected to see a decrease in churn, which we, in fact, have seen. Additionally, across all of our 10-year cohorts, we've also seen churn come down. And a lot of that is because as we get more mature in our execution and as we get more feedback in data from customers about their performance, we've been able to tune our execution. We've been able to do things and address things like common things that cause confusion for customers either with install or with peripheral devices being attached to their CPEs. We've created better tools to be able to troubleshoot for customers. And those things have had an impact on churn. And I do expect as we learn more, we'll get better there as well. So, our goal with all of our businesses is always to be the best in churn, and that's no different for us than in the HSI business.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nJud Henry: Okay. All right. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. So Mike, when you talk about why your business is so great, it always starts with the discussion of the fact that you have the best network and it's built on this incredible spectrum portfolio that's unmatched across the industry. Is there something about the broadband business that means you don't have to own and control the underlying asset in order to have the same kind of defensible position in broadband, and I'm thinking specifically of fiber here as opposed to fixed wireless access?\nMike Sievert: Well, it's a great question. For me, in the wireless space, you have this national competitive intensity where brand trust around this intangible value and network is really, really important. And we have so carefully built that brand trust over so many years that we think it's somewhat transferable. People believe in this brand, being an advocate for them, putting them first, changing the rules in their favor. And in wireless, there's a big intangible on network, which is, you can't really buy three phones and then travel the whole country. There are services that do that, and people make advertising claims based on what those services find, but people don't believe all that stuff. So it really comes down to their own lived experience and the covenant -- sort of the contact and the connection they have with the brand that they use. And what we're finding in our work is that, that brand is highly transferable into adjacent spaces because of that trust. And so, we're interested in the space. We're finding that our brand really resonates, but we're not interested in changing who we are from sort of a capital structure standpoint. And that's why we've talked about fiber the way we have.\nJonathan Chaplin: A quick follow-up, Mike. Can you just update us on how many homes you're addressing with fixed wireless access and how that's changed over the course of the quarter?\nMike Sievert: Yes. And I'll address it, but I will remind you, it's a bit of a different metric than homes passed in the broadband and fiber space. We generally talk about marketing to about 50 million homes right now. But it's a dynamic number and it changes based on penetration of given neighborhoods. And so what happens, I'll remind you is that on every sector of every tower, we have an assessment of capacity, not just now, but out into the future, assuming ongoing wireless smartphone share taking and ongoing rapid increase in wireless consumption per smartphone. And once we plot all of that out, there are sectors of towers where no normal amount of share taking or wireless smartphone consumption will use up our capacity anytime soon. And in those places, and only those places are we approving applicants for our home broadband service. And what that means is, we're essentially monetizing and selling excess capacity through this initial 5G broadband strategy. And so those are the \"homes passed\". Now, if three people in your neighborhood sign up, or four or five people, depends on the sector, the whole neighborhood comes off our list until such time as we've got that excess capacity again. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Ulf is rapidly rolling out new capacity enhancements, and we're only part way into it. I think as we wrapped up the quarter, we had what, Ulf, about 155 megahertz deployed against our Ultra Capacity?\nUlf Ewaldsson: That's right. And we continue -- I mean, we have now 70% of the payload is 5G on the network. As we continue to see more and more 5G traffic, that means we can move over frequencies that are used for LTE into 5G. And as you said earlier, we have this enormous spectrum asset in mid-band, which is where the home Internet products are residing that we can continue to leverage. We have more spectrum than anyone else has on mid-band as a potential. By the end of the year, we are approaching 200 megahertz that we will have dedicated for 5G products.\nMike Sievert: So that gives you a sense of how rapidly this is changing in terms of how we're deploying capacity. It sits in the high 150s now. It's on its way to 200 around the end of the year against Ultra Capacity 5G. And that's before broad deployments of C-band, 3.45, most of the Auction 108 proceeds, which we don't have yet, and ongoing refarming from LTE. So lots of room to run.\nJonathan Chaplin: So Mike, that 50 million is about the same as it was last quarter. So the acceleration in net adds must have come either from gaining share of decisions within the 50 million or from the reduction of churn that you mentioned earlier.\nMike Sievert: Yes. And net adds have been relatively consistent. I mean, I know it was in the high 500s this time. Every quarter will be a little different. But I would say net adds have been pretty consistent.\nJonathan Chaplin: Awesome. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Thanks, Jonathan.\nJud Henry: All right. Let's go to social. We've got a question from [Bill Ho] (ph). Given the 3Q iPhone launch and 3Q take rate, how does Q4 look for existing subscriber upgrades on devices and plans?\nMike Sievert: Okay. Well, let's start with Jon and maybe talk about what we're seeing out there in the consumer space with upgrades and what's driving that.\nJon Freier: Yes, you bet. So like we said in Q3, we had a great overall quarter when you look at what's happening with the iPhone. First of all, this iPhone 15 is a fantastic device. And it drove a lot of switching in the marketplace as you saw relative to our results. And not just iPhone 15 on a differentiated 5G network that I talked about just a few moments ago, but a different iPhone 15 because of some capabilities that really work on our network versus others. When you think about 4-carrier aggregation, when you think about voice over new radio, 20% download speeds that are faster versus an iPhone that doesn't have that. That's all great. Customers love it, et cetera. And it drove a lot of switching activity. Now relative to our existing customer base, what you're finding is you're finding us landing upgrade offers with people who need it, and not necessarily with people who don't need it. Because remember, our overall base is about 70% with the 5G handset that's out there today. And when you think about customers that are having a great lived experience today on an incredible 5G network, they look at upgrades as an opportunity to, am I really going to improve my experience. For a lot of customers, that's not really happening relative to the network that they have out there and relative to our overall positioning with our 5G devices. Remember, we had a lot of upgrades back in 2021 and 2022 in the Sprint base. We got a lot of that upgrade base happening at that time. So like we said, when you look at the overall iPhone 15 launch, I feel fantastic about that. When you look at upgrades, it's a little lower. You've seen the upgrade rate at 2.7%. It's a little lower. But also with against the backdrop of the lowest Q2 churn we've ever had followed up with the lowest Q3 postpaid phone churn that we've ever had and I like how those dynamics are playing out.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, and I would just add, Bill, to that question. I think I had expect the same dynamic to play out in Q4. That same meeting consumer demand exactly as it is. That same dynamic of because of the 5G device penetration and how the lived experience on those network actually exists for those customers. I feel equipment revenue, which as you know, isn't the value-creating element of the company, that's service revenue, that will continue to have industry-leading growth. On the equipment revenue side, I'd expect it to be in the same kind of low $3 billion range for Q4 as a result of that dynamic.\nMike Sievert: It's been a nice tailwind for us to see these upgrade rates so low and yet our churn so low at the same time. And it really speaks to the everyday experience that T-Mobile customers are having on the most advanced 5G network. And they just don't feel as compelled to take action because they have a 5G device, and it's working remarkably well. And that trend could continue because, as Jon said it kind of fast, but the newest iPhones take advantage of four-way carrier aggregation on T-Mobile because our network is so far ahead with standalone 5G and core 5G capabilities that are much more advanced. Now the devices are starting to take advantage of those things, which means they're very future-proofed. And so, it's great to be at T-Mobile because these advanced phone features take advantage of advanced network features and may mean that you don't need a new one again as quickly as you might otherwise. For some people, that's what they want. They just want a new one every year. I'm one of those people and T-Mobile reaches that audience as well with our breakthrough plans like Go 5G, Next. So we feel like we're speaking to the right audiences with the right offers here.\nJud Henry: Okay. Great. Operator, let's go back to the phones.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question is from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. I guess, two threads, if I could. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on your comments. I mean, in the past, you've historically said that the higher switching environments were environments where T-Mobile thrive, because you were bringing your value proposition to the market more frequently. But now that upgrade rates and churn is falling across all the telco players, does this mean that you're getting just super normal switcher share from the telcos? Or is some of this now coming to you from cable as that base kind of ages in their experience in the cable industry and the promotions come off? And then I guess the second question if I could here, you kind of talked about how these headcount reductions in the summer were part of some of this larger plan for transformation of the business. Is there more to come on the transformation and maybe for lack of a better word, synergy realization as we look into the 2024-2025 period? Or are we there now? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me comment first on the competitive dynamic. You're right. I mean, we love a dynamic where there are more jump balls, more people who are category and tenders. And let me clarify, though, that devices and upgrade rates are only one input to that. So devices can be a great catalyst for switching carriers, but they're by far not the only one. And so, our job through our offers is to create those moments where people stop and say, hey, maybe I'd be better off. Maybe it's better over there at T-Mobile. And that's something we've consistently done in our Un-carrier moves have always been a technique we've used. This latest one this year, Phone Freedom and all the related offers around it is really resonating with people. We looked into it and found that AT&T, for example, was experiencing really low churn and yet high intentions to switch by their base, and that told us that people felt trapped. And so, we released an offer that was about untrapping them. And that's been the kind of thing the Un-carrier has always done. So we're out there competing ambitiously and it's working as you can see in our industry-leading postpaid phone net additions and other metrics. We are also seeing, mostly due to the aging of the base, as you said, that switching relative to cable has been improving quarter-over-quarter for several quarters in a row. That's good to see. There's no real new dynamic there with cable. They've been pretty consistent since about a year ago, and we expect that to continue. And you can see how well we're competing in a dynamic where cable is out there doing what they do relatively consistently. And then finally, you were asking about transformation and what's going on there and what we see. Do we have room to run? In many ways, we're really just getting started.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And you kind of asked it in the context of workforce transformation. There's no broad plans to do any more of that in 2024. But on transformation and efficiency, absolutely and how we'll grow core EBITDA and continue to expand that. Two elements there. One, as you know, we made significant investments in the last couple of years, whether it's in network and the pull forward that we did there, that now we're able to leverage. Similarly, in smaller markets and rural areas where you had distribution expansion and that investment is things that you can now leverage. And beyond that, of course, I mean, that's one thing this team does phenomenally well is looking at how do you harness the latest technologies? How are you really looking around corners to create the efficiency so that we can have that reinvestment into customer acquisition and profitability. So there's more of that on the runway ahead of us for sure.\nMike Sievert: Yes. And I'll just add one thing. I mean, obviously, we're not the only company that has noticed this, but the technology landscape around us is rapidly changing. And so, that means there's an opportunity for us in our post integration era as we plot the next chapter to think about recrafting our company, taking advantage of the technologies that are now available to us to become much more deeply data informed, much more AI-enabled, much more digital first, those kinds of things. And so we're -- that's taking up a lot of our team's time and attention now to reimagine how can we create a business model that really creates a fantastic experience for each customer individually, but at the same time is more efficient to operate and that's where we have ambitions.\nDavid Barden: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Jud, where do we go now?\nJud Henry: Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question is from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Mike, I just wanted to push you a little more on the capital allocation [indiscernible]. When we think about the broadband business in the next couple of years, you'll probably be either the number three or the number four biggest player in broadband. And that could either mean that you need more capacity spectrum or get an opportunity to update to the fiber. And then, of course, there is the opportunity -- I mean, [indiscernible] to maybe expand [indiscernible] So think about it mix over the next few quarters, but if we were to look at a wider lens over the next few [indiscernible] could you help us think through how you evaluate some of these opportunities longer term in terms of both fiber as well as these asset [indiscernible]? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Thank you. And I'm really sorry, your line is really garbled. And so I'm going to paraphrase what I think you're asking, but we really couldn't hear the words. I apologize. I think you're asking about longer term, how do we think about playing in the broadband space. I made comments about wireless over the next year and kind of how we think in the immediate term about fiber, but what do we see as the bigger picture, especially given the finite nature of capacity in the wireless space. And I'd say we haven't taken decisions about that. We are interested in whether or not there are techniques that are capital efficient that could extend the capacity and competitiveness of wireless into the future. And we've not yet cracked the code on that. But our team is working hard on that to see whether there are techniques that would work to do that, and that would be -- that would support a business model where we could make a fair return. So we're hard at work on that. We're hard at work executing our current strategy centered around mid-band spectrum and competing ambitiously towards that high single-digit target that we had talked about. And that seems to be very much on track. And then as we said, we're interested in fiber. And to the premise of your question, fiber is a technology for the decades. And that's not lost on us. We know that fiber will serve households and businesses a long time from now. And we also are rapidly, I think, gaining confidence that our brand and our team belong in the broadband space. That being said, we don't have an interest right now in changing the basic capital structure of this company nor the philosophy of it nor the centricity we have around wireless. And so we're looking for ways that we can, over the next couple of years, continue to learn, continue to expand, bring our brand to fiber through partnerships, through capital-light methods, investments, collaborations, those kinds of things. And they won't all be as small probably as the small pilots we're doing now. We may get after it little more significantly because our confidence is building in the space. And then -- and I know you want a longer-term vision for it, but I think we go do that for a couple of years and get good at it and execute and prove we can give returns and also get through some of that initial capital intensity period and then kind of see where we are. What this team is very focused on is making sure that the efforts that we embark on, on your behalf, deliver a great return back to you. And we're in this phase now in wireless where we're starting to realize the benefits of a disciplined strategy that has balanced growth and profitability so well over the last few years that we are now into a major shareholder return phase. And we think that's a great place to be.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you, Mike.\nMike Sievert: You bet. And I'm sorry, we couldn't hear your question as well. I hope I got close.\nJud Henry: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. First on the capital investment side. Can you discuss a little bit more over the course of the year, what were the activities that drove the incremental investment? And maybe you can give us an early read on how 2024 looks from an investment perspective and how those spending activity may be similar or different to the current year? And then just one other quick question. In the past, you discussed the mix of postpaid phones to overall postpaid net adds, I think being around 50% for 2023. But in the third quarter, that percentage ticked up because of the educational sector deactivations. So just curious if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about the mix of postpaid phones within the total postpaid net add guidance? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Let's start with the easy one at the end because I think you gave some specific numbers there, Peter. But then if you don't mind, why don't you talk about our capital philosophy for next year, and then I'll hand it to Ulf to talk about how he's going to spend all that money.\nPeter Osvaldik: Very wisely, as he always does. Yes. You're right, Mike. Q3 was kind of a unique phenomenon, which is why we gave more specific guidance as to the subset of the overall that will be postpaid phone, the approximately $3 million total for the year. And that's because Q3 in and of itself is kind of that period where we anticipated more of these educational deacts to come through and they did. So I wouldn't read through Q3's mix of phone to other, but really take it in the context of what we gave with regards to the $3 million overall for the year. And turning into everybody's teasing out 2024 guidance from me. But as we hand it over to Ulf to talk about how the investments have been made and how the shift is really into this customer-driven coverage, very data-driven, informed build to make sure that we're focused on where the best ROI is, where the best customer experience benefits will come, we've seen a lot of benefit from that. The way we're able to deliver you just saw with 300 million POPs delivered and yet we are the most capital-efficient company in the industry. And so when you turn to 2024, we continue to believe that that's really the mechanism that's going to drive capital investment, particularly with regards to the network. And so, I could see us maybe -- we gave a 9 to 10 as a range for 2024 previously. I could see us probably being on the lower end of that. We'll see what transpires in the longer term. But that's kind of the early read on where we think 2024 could land.\nMike Sievert: Yes. And I want to hand it to Ulf and team and Neville before him. We have really built thanks Ulf to your leadership, a really different approach on how to deploy capital. And it is lean, it's efficient, it's planful. And we're realizing real benefits from that right now. And we can see it in all of our diagnostics, how we're getting more for less. And so, I'm just really, really proud of that. And maybe we can talk about what the priorities are for 2024. And as a part of that, we can also hit tech life channel at Tech Life 32, congrats on the 300 million. What's the progress on the new site builds 10-K we had talked about in the merger plan. Will that complete this year? Or will that run into 2024? And tell us about the capital priorities for the network next year.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I couldn't be more delighted that we were able to pull into the station months ahead on this 300 million POP coverage. And as you said, Mike, it's very much attributed to how we do this. We do this different from other operators in the world. I would say, with our lean just-in-time process, which is focused on lead times and deliveries of precise upgrades where we need them on the ground. And that's why we were able to pull in on that. We will continue to refine this process. And now it's becoming with the teams much more of having input from AI, from all the data we have, from the market on precisely what the biggest and best returns on investments are as we continue to build and upgrade the network. We have a lot of room to run that was said earlier here in terms of putting frequencies to work in our mid-band, the mid-band that actually creates this enormous experience, the Un-carrier -- sorry, Ultra Capacity on the phone that you see with the UC. That experience, we will continue to enhance. Let me remind everybody that we got our C-band left and we got 3.45 left, for example. Those will need capital next year, and we're looking into a precise deployment of those. But we also have more LTE spectrum, as we said earlier, to put at work, more 600 with a current or a newly announced lease with Comcast that we are putting to work as well. But those actually don't need capital because we have smartly built this network in a way that we can just with commands upgrade the network to make use of those into next year. So a very effective year in terms of staying very competitive, being staying ahead of others a couple of years as we are on our 5G advantage with capital efficiency.\nMike Sievert: That's fantastic. And I know every company is being asked, how are you taking advantage of emerging AI technologies and it's really exciting that this is one of the areas where our business can benefit because the team has already begun making capital deployment decisions, as Ulf just said, based on an AI analysis of network usage and how it correlates to individual churn and satisfaction patterns at a person-by-person level. It's very exciting stuff. And that, and many other things, including the breadth of our portfolio, lead to a capital efficiency profile. So we'll see. I know Peter teased you, we don't know. It's not time to guide on next year yet. But our hope is that because of that capital efficiency and what we're now seeing, we may be able to accomplish everything we set out to accomplish next year at the lower end of that capital range. So we'll see and we'll give you an updated view as we get into next year.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nJud Henry: All right. Yes, lots of congratulatory on social on 300 million. So great job, Ulf. All right, operator, let's take our last question from the phone.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Williams with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGreg Williams: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know the industry has asked this question for quite some time, but you just had 850,000 phone adds. You're the third [indiscernible] solid phone growth. Cable's going to announce their numbers in the next 48 hours. But just getting your latest thoughts on where these additional phones are coming from and how you see industries for growth playing out in 2024? Second question is just on private networks. One of your competitors spoke yesterday saying that perhaps private networks could move the needle in 2025. We've been down this road before. But you talked constructively on advancing 5G in the past and curious this year you're seeing similar views on 2025 for private network? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: I mean, well, first of all, let's start there. I mean, for some competitors with standalone 5G capabilities, private network are here now. We're just aren't managing it through press release and vaporware. We're just quietly serving customers. Maybe, I don't know if you want to talk about any of those, Callie, that we're doing. There's a lot of exciting examples nationwide. Customers who are benefiting from this today at T-Mobile, and then we'll get to your second question.\nCallie Field: Well, I mentioned this earlier, Mike. And when we think about the challenges ahead of CIOs today, they're looking for ways to take a campus, like Boston Children's Hospital that I mentioned before and take the millions of connections with WiFi and say, hey, we've got to have something that meets the needs of the data and the connectivity in our business. And so we have a very real-time example in the health care industry and several more that we're building out that are allowing doctors and nurses and their patients to have reliable connectivity, but also with security and MDM solutions. Another thing that we -- is real for us today is the first commercial offering of a network slice that will deliver an incremental layer of security and control for our customers, combined with T-Sim Secure, which is a SIM-based [SaaS] (ph) solution, reducing complexity for IT administrators. So we're able to take these solutions and pair that with a hybrid 5G network solutions, sometimes in parts of the campus private, some parts utilizing the incredible public network that we have. So these are very real deployments today that have significant pull-through on other types of connectivity that we offer and really meet the challenges that CIOs are looking for, not to cut off a couple of dollars on a phone connection, but to really look at their entire solution for data and connectivity, and that's where we're playing because of the 5G standalone core that we have.\nMike Sievert: I mean, it's well timed because CIOs are interested in secure connections more than ever before, and they're interested in saving money, not necessarily on a per smartphone subscription, but broadly in their system of connectivity and our solutions do that. And so it's great to see and obviously an all-time record quarter for enterprise for us. And then you asked about the overall postpaid phone growth rate. And yes, it's turned out to be more resilient than a lot of people predicted. We didn't predict. We told you when you asked us last year that we weren't going to predict the whole category. But overall, postpaid phone growth continues to roll on, although at slightly more modest rates. And there's lots of things driving that. You see enterprises carrying two lines, sometimes on the same phone, sometimes on separate phones. You see postpaid growing at the expense of prepaid. That trend continues, although T-Mobile continues to grow our prepaid base across all types of connections. So we continue to lead in that space. All the donations are coming from someplace else. And then what I called in the past kind of low-calorie net adds that you see principally at some of our competitors, including newer competitors. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to go ahead and pre-announce cable's results for them as I usually do. No, I'm kidding. We do have telemetry that tries to show us all quarter long what's happening with our competitors and I think it's a remarkably consistent trend. So you see intense competition out there, probably not a lot of big surprises. And you saw us perform yet again with a market-leading, very high-quality, mostly prime 850,000 postpaid phone net additions in a quarter where we experienced an all-time record Q3 churn. So just really proud of how we're competing in an ongoing competitive dynamic.\nJud Henry: All right. That's a good place to wrap up. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Really appreciate all your support. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to both the Investor Relations or the media relations department. Again, thanks again for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes the T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike. Our ongoing delivery of best-in-class customer and financial growth quarter after quarter enables us to increase our guidance once again. So let's jump into the details. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.7 million and 5.9 million, up 50,000 at the midpoint. This reflects continued progress across all our core growth initiatives, partially offset by the deactivation of lower ARPU postpaid other data devices in the education sector, the largest of which arose during Q3. As you know, our ability to uniquely solve customer pain points led to significant connection growth in the educational sector during the pandemic, supporting the rapid need for remote learning solutions. As things are increasingly returning to normal, we had anticipated many of these connections to roll off in 2023 and do not expect the deactivation of these educational connections to have any material impact to service revenue looking forward. Included in the 5.7 million to 5.9 million is our expectation of approximately 3 million postpaid phone net additions for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher postpaid phone net ads and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $29 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up over 10% year-over-year at the midpoint, fueled by higher service revenues and synergies, and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. Now with the merger integration now substantially behind us, we will discontinue reporting synergies separately from overall business results going forward. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA, to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion for 2023 as they have under run the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities which include payments for merger related costs are now expected to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion. We now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion, delivering our network milestones ahead of schedule at a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry. The higher operating cash flows not only fund the increased CapEx, but also allow for a slight increase to free cash flow, now expected to be between $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. Not only is this up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency, but also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. Consistent with the entire year, the updated free cash flow guidance does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. Turning to income taxes, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than 1% as we continue to expand our account relationships as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. In closing, our differentiated and profitable growth strategy continues to deliver industry-leading growth and service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow along with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry to unlock shareholder value. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Yes, exactly. [Multiple Speakers] Yes, so I got up too early to roll out 2024 guidance, that's for sure. But in your question of workforce transformation. Look, I think Mike touched upon it at the beginning, and you saw us comment around this before. This is really about a tough set of actions, but as we got through the balance of the integration, we had to make some changes. That's what this team does. It looks around corners and it says, we need to make sure we create clarity in the operating of this organization, bring that entrepreneurial spirit back and make sure that we're looking at what are the headwinds and what are the tailwinds. As we think about what we laid out at Analyst Day, which seems like so long ago with respect to 2024 and what we were going to do there. A lot in the world has changed, but it's a set of all of these tailwinds and actions that we've created that still gives us confidence that we think, certainly from a core EBITDA perspective, again, I'm not going to roll out all the 2024 guidance, but we're going to come right in there in the middle of the range. And these are the kind of actions that are necessary to create that opportunity and keep bringing the ability to invest in customers and the network and the business as we are. And then Phil with regards to the [indiscernible] crack at OpEx. So again, the actions that we took really ways for us to create tailwind and further fuel the growth of the company. And so I'm not giving specific line item, OpEx guides, all of those actions were then contemplated in the updated guide for 2023 that we gave, and again, kind of the teaser we just gave about 2024 and core EBITDA there. You bet. Yes, and I would just add, Bill, to that question. I think I had expect the same dynamic to play out in Q4. That same meeting consumer demand exactly as it is. That same dynamic of because of the 5G device penetration and how the lived experience on those network actually exists for those customers. I feel equipment revenue, which as you know, isn't the value-creating element of the company, that's service revenue, that will continue to have industry-leading growth. On the equipment revenue side, I'd expect it to be in the same kind of low $3 billion range for Q4 as a result of that dynamic. Yes. And you kind of asked it in the context of workforce transformation. There's no broad plans to do any more of that in 2024. But on transformation and efficiency, absolutely and how we'll grow core EBITDA and continue to expand that. Two elements there. One, as you know, we made significant investments in the last couple of years, whether it's in network and the pull forward that we did there, that now we're able to leverage. Similarly, in smaller markets and rural areas where you had distribution expansion and that investment is things that you can now leverage. And beyond that, of course, I mean, that's one thing this team does phenomenally well is looking at how do you harness the latest technologies? How are you really looking around corners to create the efficiency so that we can have that reinvestment into customer acquisition and profitability. So there's more of that on the runway ahead of us for sure. Very wisely, as he always does. Yes. You're right, Mike. Q3 was kind of a unique phenomenon, which is why we gave more specific guidance as to the subset of the overall that will be postpaid phone, the approximately $3 million total for the year. And that's because Q3 in and of itself is kind of that period where we anticipated more of these educational deacts to come through and they did. So I wouldn't read through Q3's mix of phone to other, but really take it in the context of what we gave with regards to the $3 million overall for the year. And turning into everybody's teasing out 2024 guidance from me. But as we hand it over to Ulf to talk about how the investments have been made and how the shift is really into this customer-driven coverage, very data-driven, informed build to make sure that we're focused on where the best ROI is, where the best customer experience benefits will come, we've seen a lot of benefit from that. The way we're able to deliver you just saw with 300 million POPs delivered and yet we are the most capital-efficient company in the industry. And so when you turn to 2024, we continue to believe that that's really the mechanism that's going to drive capital investment, particularly with regards to the network. And so, I could see us maybe -- we gave a 9 to 10 as a range for 2024 previously. I could see us probably being on the lower end of that. We'll see what transpires in the longer term. But that's kind of the early read on where we think 2024 could land."

            "name": "Jon Freier",
            "content": "Yes, you bet, Mike. So yes, just to pick it up on that, 40% of the country, everything outside of the top 100 markets is how we define smaller markets and rural areas. It's about 140 million people, 50 million households, and again, 40% of the market. And we just could not be more delighted. I've been talking to you about this for a couple of years now relative to our ambitions in smaller markets and rural areas and bringing real 5G. When you think about a lot of the places that we're playing, we're bringing the only 5G network into town. And given the announcement that we just made a couple of days ago around 5G Ultra Capacity now bringing that to 300 million people across the entire country. So it's a huge opportunity when we bring the network, we're bringing the distribution, we're bringing our marketing and our special sauce relative to our value proposition and more choice to smaller markets and rural areas. It's been fantastic. It's a huge milestone for us to be across all these markets now the leader of share of port ends. We're not playing in all the markets, just as a reminder. It's about 70% of the markets that we're playing in. We're not even playing across all the markets. And even with that, now we're the share leader in terms of share taker, I should say, not necessarily share leader, but share taker. And I mentioned this a few times. We've had a dedicated team as a big part of our success in smaller markets, rural areas, really getting at to this with our dedicated team that's focused on driving the kind of commercial success that we're looking for. And our overall ambition is unchanged. And we're right on track to hit 20% share of household by the end of 2025. Yes, you bet. So like we said in Q3, we had a great overall quarter when you look at what's happening with the iPhone. First of all, this iPhone 15 is a fantastic device. And it drove a lot of switching in the marketplace as you saw relative to our results. And not just iPhone 15 on a differentiated 5G network that I talked about just a few moments ago, but a different iPhone 15 because of some capabilities that really work on our network versus others. When you think about 4-carrier aggregation, when you think about voice over new radio, 20% download speeds that are faster versus an iPhone that doesn't have that. That's all great. Customers love it, et cetera. And it drove a lot of switching activity. Now relative to our existing customer base, what you're finding is you're finding us landing upgrade offers with people who need it, and not necessarily with people who don't need it. Because remember, our overall base is about 70% with the 5G handset that's out there today. And when you think about customers that are having a great lived experience today on an incredible 5G network, they look at upgrades as an opportunity to, am I really going to improve my experience. For a lot of customers, that's not really happening relative to the network that they have out there and relative to our overall positioning with our 5G devices. Remember, we had a lot of upgrades back in 2021 and 2022 in the Sprint base. We got a lot of that upgrade base happening at that time. So like we said, when you look at the overall iPhone 15 launch, I feel fantastic about that. When you look at upgrades, it's a little lower. You've seen the upgrade rate at 2.7%. It's a little lower. But also with against the backdrop of the lowest Q2 churn we've ever had followed up with the lowest Q3 postpaid phone churn that we've ever had and I like how those dynamics are playing out."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yes. Maybe I can start with that. Go 5G Plus and Next have been, like we've talked about the last couple cycles, incredible successes for us. And it really starts with the fact that these are hands down the best value in this industry. If you look at all the features that come with those plans, there's hundreds of dollars of value for customers on a monthly basis with the streaming benefits and the in-flight Wi-Fi and roaming benefits are on those plans. But in a time when the market and customers are so focused on device value, there is not a plan in the industry that gives customers more flexibility and more value on device than the Go 5G plans do. And you really saw that in this last iPhone cycle where we really differentiated with the flexibility on upgrade. When the rest of the market is at three years, we had offers for customers that allowed them to upgrade as frequently as one year. Those plans really create the platform for our core pricing strategy, which is, how can we give customers more and more value and allow them to move up our price card because they feel like they're getting something additional from us. So that is the foundation of our core pricing value. As Mike said, we conduct tests and pilots all the time, all the time, and we will continue to do so because we still think there's opportunities both to deliver more value for customers in a bunch of different ways, but also look for opportunities to simplify our overall portfolio. So I would expect to see more of those kinds of tests from us, because it's been a consistent practice throughout the entire un-carrier journey so that we get it right for the experience for our customers. Yeah, in fact, leading industry of all kinds of -- different kinds of broadband products. Yes, I think there's two things. One is the one that Mike just said. And we've talked about this previously, that when you have a new broadband business, one that literally has doubled in size year-over-year, that we have many more customers that are brand new customers that churn at a higher rate. That's just the way that the churn curve works on products like these, including wireless. Early 10-year customers churn at a higher rate. And as customers mature and our base matures, we expected to see a decrease in churn, which we, in fact, have seen. Additionally, across all of our 10-year cohorts, we've also seen churn come down. And a lot of that is because as we get more mature in our execution and as we get more feedback in data from customers about their performance, we've been able to tune our execution. We've been able to do things and address things like common things that cause confusion for customers either with install or with peripheral devices being attached to their CPEs. We've created better tools to be able to troubleshoot for customers. And those things have had an impact on churn. And I do expect as we learn more, we'll get better there as well. So, our goal with all of our businesses is always to be the best in churn, and that's no different for us than in the HSI business."

            "content": "Well, thanks Phil for the question. And I'll tell you, as a result of our network leadership and the solutions that are built for today's unique challenges of a CIO, we continue to deliver highly profitable growth. One of our highest postpaid phone net ads and lowest phone churn quarters in history and delivered results once again that outperformed our benchmark competitor. This quarter also we delivered our highest enterprise postpaid net ads ever. So we're seeing growth in all segments, in small business and in enterprise. As for the macro environment, while there's probably a portion that are price sensitive. We know from years of experience that price alone doesn't determine a win with enterprise and government who are uncompromising when it comes to network performance and complete solutions. Solutions like we recently deployed at Boston Children's Hospital, which is the healthcare industry's first ever hybrid 5G network solution for over 18 buildings which is supporting critical applications not only reliable connectivity, but also with security and MDM solutions for doctors to provide telehealth services to their patients. So let me pause there and Mike, see if there's anything else. Well, I mentioned this earlier, Mike. And when we think about the challenges ahead of CIOs today, they're looking for ways to take a campus, like Boston Children's Hospital that I mentioned before and take the millions of connections with WiFi and say, hey, we've got to have something that meets the needs of the data and the connectivity in our business.

            "content": "That's right. And we continue -- I mean, we have now 70% of the payload is 5G on the network. As we continue to see more and more 5G traffic, that means we can move over frequencies that are used for LTE into 5G. And as you said earlier, we have this enormous spectrum asset in mid-band, which is where the home Internet products are residing that we can continue to leverage. We have more spectrum than anyone else has on mid-band as a potential. By the end of the year, we are approaching 200 megahertz that we will have dedicated for 5G products. Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I couldn't be more delighted that we were able to pull into the station months ahead on this 300 million POP coverage. And as you said, Mike, it's very much attributed to how we do this. We do this different from other operators in the world. I would say, with our lean just-in-time process, which is focused on lead times and deliveries of precise upgrades where we need them on the ground. And that's why we were able to pull in on that. We will continue to refine this process. And now it's becoming with the teams much more of having input from AI, from all the data we have, from the market on precisely what the biggest and best returns on investments are as we continue to build and upgrade the network. We have a lot of room to run that was said earlier here in terms of putting frequencies to work in our mid-band, the mid-band that actually creates this enormous experience, the Un-carrier -- sorry, Ultra Capacity on the phone that you see with the UC. That experience, we will continue to enhance. Let me remind everybody that we got our C-band left and we got 3.45 left, for example. Those will need capital next year, and we're looking into a precise deployment of those. But we also have more LTE spectrum, as we said earlier, to put at work, more 600 with a current or a newly announced lease with Comcast that we are putting to work as well. But those actually don't need capital because we have smartly built this network in a way that we can just with commands upgrade the network to make use of those into next year. So a very effective year in terms of staying very competitive, being staying ahead of others a couple of years as we are on our 5G advantage with capital efficiency."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good morning, everybody. If you're watching on our webcast, you can see we're coming to you from New York City and, here with several members of my senior leadership team, and we're looking forward to discussing another quarter of great results. Our strategy to deliver the best network coupled with the best value and the best customer experience has remained remarkably consistent. And our Q3 results again show how well that strategy is working with another quarter of industry leading customer and financial growth. I want to thank our amazing team nationwide. We have tackled a lot of change together recently to position our company for success in the future, and it hasn't all been easy. But this team showed once again what loving customers looks like and how that simple philosophy translates into success. I'm sure you've seen the numbers already. So I'm going to spare you the greatest hits album of all the quarterly results and just a couple of things with a few comments so that we can get [Technical Difficulty] First, as we announced yesterday, I am so proud of our network team for reaching our audacious goal of 300 million people covered with dedicated mid-band 5G over two months ahead of our year-end target. We announced this goal nearly three years ago. And then we got to work and got it done. And to this day, no one else in our industry has stated any plans to match it at any time in the future. I know it may get confusing with others celebrating their C-band deployments, which might have a casual observer. Believe, our network lead could be narrowing, but the opposite is true. In fact, even after their C-band deployments, according to Ookla, T-Mobile's nationwide median speeds were double the next competitor's speeds in September -- double in September. And our mid-band 5G square mile coverage is also double the next closest competitor, meaning, others still have a lot of wood to chop beyond just population dense pockets to ever reach the expansive geography where T-Mobile is today. And we have more spectrum dedicated to 5G than anyone else. Before we've even begun to deploy our C-band, our 3.45 GHz spectrum, or Auction 108 2.5 GHz licenses, let alone re-farming our AWS. Listen, we started the 5G era two years ahead of the competition and today we remain two or more years ahead. And I predict that two years from now, we still will be. What all this translates to is a superior customer experience. We're rapidly putting our spectrum resources to work for the benefit of consumers and businesses. And we're doing it with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Most exciting part, many prospective customers are only just beginning to take notice that T-Mobile is the overall network lever, leaving lots of growth runway ahead. And we're also expanding on our long-held fame for delivering the best value. Our latest Un-Carrier move is freeing customers locked into three-year contracts, and our new Go 5G rate plans are delivering the most feature-rich options in wireless. Phone freedom has turned out to be one of our most exciting Un-Carrier moves ever, and it continues to bring high-quality switchers to T-Mobile, as you could see in our industry-leading postpaid account growth. We're also executing on our ARPA revenue growth strategy, posting another strong quarter well over plus 1% versus a year ago and revenue per account on the strength of Go 5G plus and multiple products. Some have asked, if our new higher value rate plans are most popular with consumers, then why isn't ARPU growing faster too? And I'll point out that consumer ARPU does continue to grow even after offsets from growing segments like 55+ and military. And consumer overall is being partially offset by profitable growth in the enterprise space at somewhat lower ARPUs, but attractive CLVs, a development that's contributing well to our financial growth. And we're doing all of this within a backdrop of a wireless industry that continues to grow service revenues and cash flows, while simultaneously seeing customers win from healthy competition that delivers more value and better networks. In fact, this industry produces cash flow and EBITDA much higher than five years ago, while at the same time, customers are enjoying 3 times more data at 4 times higher speeds, while paying just a fraction of the price per unit consumed versus before. And that's before factoring in the expanded device promotions now routinely offered. A vibrant profitable business delivering rapidly improving network service and value. That's the win-win 5G dividend nobody's talking about, and it helps to showcase why T-Mobile's 5G leadership is so important. This is certainly true in T-Mobile for Business, where we have the highest ever account net ads overall and our highest ever postpaid nets in enterprise based on the strength of our 5G enabled solutions. Consumers are also choosing T-Mobile above all others. Prime network seekers in the top 100 markets increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. And for the first time ever, T-Mobile also won the highest share of switchers in smaller markets and rural areas in Q3. Broadband also had another strong quarter. We now serve over 4.2 million customers who are enjoying a great experience with net promoter scores that remain more than 30 points higher than cable, with churn improving year-over-year as well. We remain very much on pace for our longer term goals with 5G broadband. Overall, our customer growth strategy remains differentiated and durable, resulting in industry leading service revenue growth both at the total company level and at the postpaid service revenue level where most of the value is created, which grew more than 6% or more than 1.5 times the growth rate of peers. That top-line leadership coupled with our synergy realization and focus on cost efficiencies drove double-digit growth and core adjusted EBITDA with the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry. This allows us to not only raise our guidance for this year again, it also gives us excitement and confidence in the future. With our significant growth opportunities continuing to scale, with lots of room to run, it sets us up for sustained leadership in both customer and service revenue growth as we look ahead. And we see opportunities amid the rapidly changing technology landscape as well, all across our business, to drive further revenue growth, margin expansion, and free cash flow growth that will allow us to fund our growth investments in our customers and network, as well as provide the potential for substantial ongoing shareholder returns. This amazing customer-loving team continues to perform beautifully with so much exciting potential ahead, showing why it's not just a tagline when we say that for customers, employees, and investors alike, it's better over here at T-Mobile. Okay, Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Okay, John. Let's start with Jon Freier who maybe can give a little color on what we're seeing in smaller markets and rural areas. As you heard in my prepared remarks, this is a huge milestone, because T-Mobile achieved leadership in share of switchers for the first time ever across the entirety of what we call smaller markets and rural areas, which is about 40% of the country. You take these last couple of quarters and drag them right, we'll be the share leader soon enough in smaller markets and rural areas. Peter, any comments on OpEx for 2024? Why don't you just go ahead and roll out the guidance for 2020? I was kind of kidding, but you did roll out the guidance. Okay. That's pretty good. It is remarkable that we did this Analyst Day years ago, I think, early in 2021 and laid out several years of expectations. And as we sit here today, knocking on 2024, we're able to outlook a year next year that looks just like we had anticipated, right down the middle. And that's something that I'm particularly proud of, given that it's not at all like we thought. I mean, it's really different than we thought. And yet we make course corrections as we go to keep the promises that we made to you front and center, a vibrant growing business, developing EBITDA and cashflow, and doing breakthrough things for customers and businesses. And that's what's happening. So we couldn't be more excited about next year. Operator, next question. Yes. Thanks, Simon. Well, nothing's changed in terms of our philosophy and approach as it relates to broadband. And just to take you back, what we had said still holds, which is, we are conducting all kinds of experiments in the space, including observing our national performance in 5G home broadband, which, if anything, that performance and the resonance of our brand and our team's ability to execute in the space, along with the trials that we're doing in fiber, only bolster our confidence that our brand and our team belong in this market. But nothing has changed in terms of our philosophy. We like this business model, and to the extent we make investments or partnerships in the area, our view is, it should be capital light, generally off balance sheet, et cetera. Speculation, I know is out there. I can't clarify we're not the partner to [JANA] (ph) in the transaction that was rumored a couple weeks ago. Although we remain interested in partnerships like the kinds we have rolled out pilots around and other constructs that are generally capital light, generally off balance sheet. And that's for a reason. We're performing really well and demonstrating through our tests as well as our broad scale performance in 5G home broadband that our brand and our team belong in this space and we can create value. As it relates to new ways to do wireless broadband, you said it at the very end there, and I mentioned in my remarks, Ulf and team, now that they've reached 300 million people with mid-band Ultra Capacity 5G are now setting about the task of deploying all of our spectrum resources to that base. And we're only just beginning. We have the bulk of our 2.5 GHz now rolling out. But our target is to be at 200 megahertz around the end of this year deployed against the 300 million people. And then more room to run next year, because as I said, we have Auction 108 proceeds still pending, we have C-band that we haven't deployed, 3.45, as well as refarming potential from spectrum being used for LTE right now, like AWS. And so lots of room to run as it relates to pouring new capacity into this network. And that means, we right now at a broad scale are not looking at alternatives to that from a wireless standpoint. We use millimeter wave pretty strategically in very dense places and so far that's a great use for it. I will say, as we said last time, so no change, that we remain open minded to whether there are techniques that would allow us to deploy capital specifically for 5G broadband and make a great return for you. But so far, we haven't drawn any conclusions that that's a scalable opportunity for us. You bet. Okay, let's start with Callie on business. And then we'll come back to another crack at OpEx. So what's going on in business, Cellie? Yeah, and specifically on ARPU, we said in our prepared remarks, it's somewhat lower than consumer, but highly accretive from a CLV and value creation standpoint. So these are great customers. We are finding, as Callie said, that enterprises are not picking us because we're the lowest price, although we compete ambitiously on price. They're picking us because of the solutions that Callie's team has brought to the market. And that's very helpful from a value creation standpoint for us. So we continually look at the customer lifetime value, net of all the costs to serve these customers, and find that enterprise customers are highly attractive, and therefore contributing to our financial results. And that's why Peter always warns you, ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And we're not solving for it, we're solving for value creation and return on our effort and investment and enterprise is a great place to put our effort and investment. Yes, of course, Craig. And by the way, that was sort of not very accurately reported. So let me just kind of clear it up. As you guys know, because you follow us so closely, more so than the press. We tend to do tests and pilots of things quite a bit to try to figure out what's the right answer. In this case, we had a test cell to try to understand customer interest in and acceptance of migrating off old legacy rate plans to something that's higher value for them and for us. And we had planned to test and did some training around that. And then it leaked. And it leaked as if it was a broad national thing. And it kind of wasn't. Now, I don't know that we still have to do that test cell, because to your point, we did get plenty of feedback, thanks to the erroneous context of the leak. And I think we've learned that particular test cell isn't something that our customers are going to love. Now, exactly none have rolled out. So even to your question that we recently rolled out, we didn't. We had planned it -- we had planned it as a test cell, and then we aren't doing it. Because I think we got plenty of feedback. But maybe Mike, you can talk about our philosophy on pricing, things we're interested in, what we're hearing from customers, and also what we're seeing with Go 5G Plus and Next. Yes. Although that particular test cell doesn't need to be executed now we remain very interested in rationalizing our legacy rate plans for IT purposes, simplification purposes, revenue realization purposes, customer satisfaction and retention purposes. So we're going to stay at it, but that particular idea will probably do something different. Good, okay. Yes, absolutely. In fact, I'll give a broader picture, rate plan and device promotions, which have become a big part of the competitive milieu over the last couple of years. It's intense. It's really competitive. And it's pretty consistent too. I mean, I think it's been consistently competitive all year. And you saw we delivered an incredible Q2 and Q3 in that context. Some of the best performance in our history, the lowest churn ever for a Q2 and for a Q3 in our history. We continue to lead in postpaid net additions and delivered EBITDA performance and outlooks on EBITDA that show that we're monetizing that growth as well. So we're really comfortable in this competitive dynamic and it's stable and consistent. So that's what's going on out there. It's intense. We like it that way. And, I would say, we're entering typically very intense seasonal period around the holidays, and I expect it to be a slog out there just like it is every year. All right. Yes, I'd love to take credit for that. I think a lot of it's just the math of the aging of our base. So this product was great when we launched it. And that's because we had made sure it would be great before we took it national. And so, it's generally been pretty consistent. One of the ways you can look at that is the net promoter scores, which have been pretty consistent. Well, it's a great question. For me, in the wireless space, you have this national competitive intensity where brand trust around this intangible value and network is really, really important. And we have so carefully built that brand trust over so many years that we think it's somewhat transferable. People believe in this brand, being an advocate for them, putting them first, changing the rules in their favor. And in wireless, there's a big intangible on network, which is, you can't really buy three phones and then travel the whole country. There are services that do that, and people make advertising claims based on what those services find, but people don't believe all that stuff. So it really comes down to their own lived experience and the covenant -- sort of the contact and the connection they have with the brand that they use. And what we're finding in our work is that, that brand is highly transferable into adjacent spaces because of that trust. And so, we're interested in the space. We're finding that our brand really resonates, but we're not interested in changing who we are from sort of a capital structure standpoint. And that's why we've talked about fiber the way we have. Yes. And I'll address it, but I will remind you, it's a bit of a different metric than homes passed in the broadband and fiber space. We generally talk about marketing to about 50 million homes right now. But it's a dynamic number and it changes based on penetration of given neighborhoods. And so what happens, I'll remind you is that on every sector of every tower, we have an assessment of capacity, not just now, but out into the future, assuming ongoing wireless smartphone share taking and ongoing rapid increase in wireless consumption per smartphone. And once we plot all of that out, there are sectors of towers where no normal amount of share taking or wireless smartphone consumption will use up our capacity anytime soon. And in those places, and only those places are we approving applicants for our home broadband service. And what that means is, we're essentially monetizing and selling excess capacity through this initial 5G broadband strategy. And so those are the \"homes passed\". Now, if three people in your neighborhood sign up, or four or five people, depends on the sector, the whole neighborhood comes off our list until such time as we've got that excess capacity again. Now, as I mentioned earlier, Ulf is rapidly rolling out new capacity enhancements, and we're only part way into it. I think as we wrapped up the quarter, we had what, Ulf, about 155 megahertz deployed against our Ultra Capacity? So that gives you a sense of how rapidly this is changing in terms of how we're deploying capacity. It sits in the high 150s now. It's on its way to 200 around the end of the year against Ultra Capacity 5G. And that's before broad deployments of C-band, 3.45, most of the Auction 108 proceeds, which we don't have yet, and ongoing refarming from LTE. So lots of room to run. Yes. And net adds have been relatively consistent. I mean, I know it was in the high 500s this time. Every quarter will be a little different. But I would say net adds have been pretty consistent. You bet. Thanks, Jonathan. Okay. Well, let's start with Jon and maybe talk about what we're seeing out there in the consumer space with upgrades and what's driving that. It's been a nice tailwind for us to see these upgrade rates so low and yet our churn so low at the same time. And it really speaks to the everyday experience that T-Mobile customers are having on the most advanced 5G network. And they just don't feel as compelled to take action because they have a 5G device, and it's working remarkably well. And that trend could continue because, as Jon said it kind of fast, but the newest iPhones take advantage of four-way carrier aggregation on T-Mobile because our network is so far ahead with standalone 5G and core 5G capabilities that are much more advanced. Now the devices are starting to take advantage of those things, which means they're very future-proofed. And so, it's great to be at T-Mobile because these advanced phone features take advantage of advanced network features and may mean that you don't need a new one again as quickly as you might otherwise. For some people, that's what they want. They just want a new one every year. I'm one of those people and T-Mobile reaches that audience as well with our breakthrough plans like Go 5G, Next. So we feel like we're speaking to the right audiences with the right offers here. Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me comment first on the competitive dynamic. You're right. I mean, we love a dynamic where there are more jump balls, more people who are category and tenders. And let me clarify, though, that devices and upgrade rates are only one input to that. So devices can be a great catalyst for switching carriers, but they're by far not the only one. And so, our job through our offers is to create those moments where people stop and say, hey, maybe I'd be better off. Maybe it's better over there at T-Mobile. And that's something we've consistently done in our Un-carrier moves have always been a technique we've used. This latest one this year, Phone Freedom and all the related offers around it is really resonating with people. We looked into it and found that AT&T, for example, was experiencing really low churn and yet high intentions to switch by their base, and that told us that people felt trapped. And so, we released an offer that was about untrapping them. And that's been the kind of thing the Un-carrier has always done. So we're out there competing ambitiously and it's working as you can see in our industry-leading postpaid phone net additions and other metrics. We are also seeing, mostly due to the aging of the base, as you said, that switching relative to cable has been improving quarter-over-quarter for several quarters in a row. That's good to see. There's no real new dynamic there with cable. They've been pretty consistent since about a year ago, and we expect that to continue. And you can see how well we're competing in a dynamic where cable is out there doing what they do relatively consistently. And then finally, you were asking about transformation and what's going on there and what we see. Do we have room to run? In many ways, we're really just getting started. Yes. And I'll just add one thing. I mean, obviously, we're not the only company that has noticed this, but the technology landscape around us is rapidly changing. And so, that means there's an opportunity for us in our post integration era as we plot the next chapter to think about recrafting our company, taking advantage of the technologies that are now available to us to become much more deeply data informed, much more AI-enabled, much more digital first, those kinds of things. And so we're -- that's taking up a lot of our team's time and attention now to reimagine how can we create a business model that really creates a fantastic experience for each customer individually, but at the same time is more efficient to operate and that's where we have ambitions. Okay. Jud, where do we go now? Yes. Thank you. And I'm really sorry, your line is really garbled. And so I'm going to paraphrase what I think you're asking, but we really couldn't hear the words. I apologize. I think you're asking about longer term, how do we think about playing in the broadband space. I made comments about wireless over the next year and kind of how we think in the immediate term about fiber, but what do we see as the bigger picture, especially given the finite nature of capacity in the wireless space. And I'd say we haven't taken decisions about that. We are interested in whether or not there are techniques that are capital efficient that could extend the capacity and competitiveness of wireless into the future. And we've not yet cracked the code on that. But our team is working hard on that to see whether there are techniques that would work to do that, and that would be -- that would support a business model where we could make a fair return. So we're hard at work on that. We're hard at work executing our current strategy centered around mid-band spectrum and competing ambitiously towards that high single-digit target that we had talked about. And that seems to be very much on track. And then as we said, we're interested in fiber. And to the premise of your question, fiber is a technology for the decades. And that's not lost on us. We know that fiber will serve households and businesses a long time from now. And we also are rapidly, I think, gaining confidence that our brand and our team belong in the broadband space. That being said, we don't have an interest right now in changing the basic capital structure of this company nor the philosophy of it nor the centricity we have around wireless. And so we're looking for ways that we can, over the next couple of years, continue to learn, continue to expand, bring our brand to fiber through partnerships, through capital-light methods, investments, collaborations, those kinds of things. And they won't all be as small probably as the small pilots we're doing now. We may get after it little more significantly because our confidence is building in the space. And then -- and I know you want a longer-term vision for it, but I think we go do that for a couple of years and get good at it and execute and prove we can give returns and also get through some of that initial capital intensity period and then kind of see where we are. What this team is very focused on is making sure that the efforts that we embark on, on your behalf, deliver a great return back to you. And we're in this phase now in wireless where we're starting to realize the benefits of a disciplined strategy that has balanced growth and profitability so well over the last few years that we are now into a major shareholder return phase. And we think that's a great place to be. You bet. And I'm sorry, we couldn't hear your question as well. I hope I got close. Okay. Let's start with the easy one at the end because I think you gave some specific numbers there, Peter. But then if you don't mind, why don't you talk about our capital philosophy for next year, and then I'll hand it to Ulf to talk about how he's going to spend all that money. Yes. And I want to hand it to Ulf and team and Neville before him. We have really built thanks Ulf to your leadership, a really different approach on how to deploy capital. And it is lean, it's efficient, it's planful. And we're realizing real benefits from that right now. And we can see it in all of our diagnostics, how we're getting more for less. And so, I'm just really, really proud of that. And maybe we can talk about what the priorities are for 2024. And as a part of that, we can also hit tech life channel at Tech Life 32, congrats on the 300 million. What's the progress on the new site builds 10-K we had talked about in the merger plan. Will that complete this year? Or will that run into 2024? And tell us about the capital priorities for the network next year. That's fantastic. And I know every company is being asked, how are you taking advantage of emerging AI technologies and it's really exciting that this is one of the areas where our business can benefit because the team has already begun making capital deployment decisions, as Ulf just said, based on an AI analysis of network usage and how it correlates to individual churn and satisfaction patterns at a person-by-person level. It's very exciting stuff. And that, and many other things, including the breadth of our portfolio, lead to a capital efficiency profile. So we'll see. I know Peter teased you, we don't know. It's not time to guide on next year yet. But our hope is that because of that capital efficiency and what we're now seeing, we may be able to accomplish everything we set out to accomplish next year at the lower end of that capital range. So we'll see and we'll give you an updated view as we get into next year. You bet. I mean, well, first of all, let's start there. I mean, for some competitors with standalone 5G capabilities, private network are here now. We're just aren't managing it through press release and vaporware. We're just quietly serving customers. Maybe, I don't know if you want to talk about any of those, Callie, that we're doing. There's a lot of exciting examples nationwide. Customers who are benefiting from this today at T-Mobile, and then we'll get to your second question. I mean, it's well timed because CIOs are interested in secure connections more than ever before, and they're interested in saving money, not necessarily on a per smartphone subscription, but broadly in their system of connectivity and our solutions do that. And so it's great to see and obviously an all-time record quarter for enterprise for us. And then you asked about the overall postpaid phone growth rate. And yes, it's turned out to be more resilient than a lot of people predicted. We didn't predict. We told you when you asked us last year that we weren't going to predict the whole category. But overall, postpaid phone growth continues to roll on, although at slightly more modest rates. And there's lots of things driving that. You see enterprises carrying two lines, sometimes on the same phone, sometimes on separate phones. You see postpaid growing at the expense of prepaid. That trend continues, although T-Mobile continues to grow our prepaid base across all types of connections. So we continue to lead in that space. All the donations are coming from someplace else. And then what I called in the past kind of low-calorie net adds that you see principally at some of our competitors, including newer competitors. And thank you for giving me the opportunity to go ahead and pre-announce cable's results for them as I usually do. No, I'm kidding. We do have telemetry that tries to show us all quarter long what's happening with our competitors and I think it's a remarkably consistent trend. So you see intense competition out there, probably not a lot of big surprises. And you saw us perform yet again with a market-leading, very high-quality, mostly prime 850,000 postpaid phone net additions in a quarter where we experienced an all-time record Q3 churn. So just really proud of how we're competing in an ongoing competitive dynamic."

Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor back book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and the non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. As you can see, we're here with several members of our senior management team. We're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington and we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me share just a few comments. If you'll recall at our Analyst Day in early 2021, we shared our strategy to build the best network, couple it with a leading un-carrier value proposition and customer experience and grow our share in areas where T-Mobile was massively underpenetrated relative to our peers. That strategy and our approach has remained remarkably consistent and our Q2 results continue to show that it's working better than ever. In fact, T-Mobile delivered our highest Q2 postpaid phone net adds in eight years, fueled by both industry leading gross adds and the lowest postpaid phone churn in company history. And importantly, we did this while industry growth normalized, proving that the growth opportunities and durable advantages we've been sharing with you really are unique to T-Mobile. We also told you that if we delivered the best product and the best value and the best experiences, there was no reason we couldn't get to the lowest churn in the industry, remember that. And in Q2, we did it. For the first time in our history, T-Mobile reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry. That is a remarkable statement and it's a testament to the work our team has done to build the best network. And to further our value proposition to deliver even better experiences to customers. Now I'm sure there's still going to be some back and forth between us and the other guys before we consistently put them in the rearview mirror for good on churn, but all the same, it is great to get this first win. We also continue to run the business in a smart and sustainable manner, translating our industry leading customer growth in Q2 into industry leading service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth, while growing free cash flow by more than 60% year-over-year. This industry leading customer and financial growth led us to raise guidance for the year again. And we're fortunate to deliver these industry leading results within the context of a vibrant wireless industry, with growing industry service revenues and industry cash flows and healthy competition that continues to deliver more value and better networks to customers. In fact, on network, we not only defended, but extended our leadership in both overall and 5G performance. With the latest third-party reports showing that T-Mobile's lead is widening. Looking at Ookla data. T-Mobile once again swept every category for overall network performance with median download speeds, more than double our closest competitor. We've long talked about how our dedicated 5G spectrum assets with superior propagation would result in a demonstrable advantage in customers' everyday lived experiences even as the competitors try to catch us. T-Mobile's head start, our dedicated 5G spectrum assets and our technology leadership are the things that allow us to stay meaningfully ahead as in like two years or more ahead in 5G reach and overall network performance and to stay ahead for years to come. And the most exciting part is that many prospective customers are only just beginning to notice, which means lots of the benefit from this is in front of us. And importantly, these things also allow it to do it all with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Now we also continue to build on our fame for providing the best value. Our latest un-carrier move Phone Freedom, freeze customers locked up into those 3-year contracts at the carriers. And our new go 5G plus rate plan delivers the best value in wireless. The response from customers has been really amazing. In fact, Go5G Plus instantly became our most popular plan, and we're seeing improved porting ratios against every competitor including yet another quarter of year-over-year improvement against cable. In fact, total postpaid porting ratios for us have improved every month since we launched Phone Freedom including in July. As more and more customers learn that they can break free from those three-year contracts come to a better network and get a better value at T-Mobile. All of these catalysts, coupled with our unique growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets are what enable a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition and you're seeing it again in these Q2 results. We added 299,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest reported in the industry showing that we continue to win the switching decisions in the market. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.6 million again leading the industry by a wide margin. This included postpaid phone net adds of 760,000, our highest Q2 in eight years, even as the industry sees more normalized levels of growth. Our increased share was driven by our industry best phone gross adds, which grew over last year's Q2 as well as the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history. And as I mentioned, the lowest in the industry for the first time ever at just 0.77%. In T-Mobile for Business, we had a record quarter with best ever phone net adds and our lowest ever phone churn. Enterprise and government customers buy based on their own rigorous testing of the networks, not just price, and our network leadership, innovative solutions and customer experiences are driving major wins and fueling our momentum in these segments. We're attracting profitable customers with CLVs in the hundreds of dollars each and still growing. As I mentioned, consumers are beginning to take notice of our network strides as well, as we're winning prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. We saw our share of switchers in the top 100 markets increase both sequentially and year-over-year. In smaller markets and rural areas, where we continue to bring the first and in many places, only 5G network, we're seeing an incredible response. We're capturing a win share of switchers in these areas in the upper 30s, which shows we're not only on track to meet our goal of 20% share in 2025, but it gives us confidence we have room to run in the years beyond. In addition to mobile wireless, we added 509,000 high speed Internet customers. Notably, we've continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched over two years ago as demand for the product just continues to grow. And we saw a sequential improvement in churn again this quarter and Net Promoter Scores that remain multiples higher than cable, demonstrating how our high speed Internet resonates with and satisfies an important target audience within this larger broadband market. We also celebrated another major milestone in our Sprint merger integration as we are now substantially complete with both the billing migration and retail rationalization, well ahead of our year-end target. At every step of our integration journey, the customer has been our primary focus. As you know, this has allowed us to not only unlock synergies bigger and faster than expected, but also to deliver industry leading growth and record low churn at the same time. I could not be more proud of what our team has accomplished in this area. Okay. I'm going to wrap it up. We are pulling into the station halfway 2023 with great momentum. Our postpaid phone net adds year-to-date are right on track with last year, which was a growth record year for us. We continue to extend our durable network and value leadership over the competition, which fuels our growth opportunities. And our profitable growth strategy continues to translate into the highest core adjusted EBITDA growth and year-to-date cash flow conversion in the industry. Listen, in our industry, change is a constant, but our team navigates it definitely with the customer as our North Star. And because of that, there has never been a more exciting time to be at T-Mobile. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance for 2023.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Q2 was another quarter of best-in-class profitable growth, which underpins the updated guidance that I'll share with you in a moment. It starts with the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 5% year-over-year driven by continued increases in both postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in an 11% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points year-over-year. In addition, free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year and with the highest free cash flow to service revenue margin relative to our peers year-to-date. We expect this to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 25.2 million shares for $3.5 billion in Q2 with a cumulative total of 83.5 million shares repurchased for $11.8 billion as of July 21. All right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 million and 5.9 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $28.9 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.6 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $18 billion to $18.3 billion and we now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion delivering a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry, unlocked by our network leadership. We expect CapEx to taper in Q3 and then further in Q4. The slightly higher operating cash flows fund the increased CapEx resulting in strong free cash flow of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than the 1% we had previously guided for 2023 as we continue to expand our account relationships across products and services as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. Before I wrap up, I want to remind folks that we closed the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent on May 1, which had a partial impact on our results in Q2 and we expect the full run rate impact beginning in Q3 as I laid out last quarter. In closing, we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities to deliver the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry and unlock shareholder value. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?\nA - Jud Henry: All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Certainly, thank you. That will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJud Henry: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks for taking the question. And it was great to see -- great to see the strong cash flow in the quarter. In light of that, we've gotten a few questions around why you decided to downtick a little bit on the buyback. And I guess maybe the higher level question we're getting now that you're much further into the program. How do you think about managing that program going forward? I mean cash flow is obviously an input. You're going to be making some payments for C-band spectrum this year. So what's the right way for investors to kind of frame your expectations around how you're going to manage that on a go-forward basis? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: That sounds great. Thanks, Brett. I'll start and then maybe hand it to Peter for some comments. The way I think about it is, we're buying at a pace through -- mostly through predesigned 10b5-1 programs in order to be able to meet the authorization during the time frame of the authorization. So if you recall, the initial authorization of this program is a $14 billion program that takes us through September. And if you look at some of our activity early in the year where we were able to grab some additional run rate. Now the remaining funds relative to the remaining time suggests a run rate where we have it. So it's not really a downtick so much as just kind of a programmatic view. And then -- and maybe Peter can pile in on the second part. The way we think about it broadly is that there's essentially been no underlying change to the thesis we've been communicating all along. Now our Board hasn't made a determination yet about the second step, but the inputs to those steps have to do with the free cash flow development of this company, which, as you mentioned in the premise of your question is right on track. We're guiding to 75% year-over-year cash flow growth this year. And the underpinnings of the growth in the business, as you saw from our fantastic Q2 momentum suggests another good year in '24. And so -- as the cash flow develops, that's what gives us the confidence that, that original thesis of around $60 billion through 2025 is intact. But maybe you can also comment, Peter, on kind of how we think about this from a dedication of resources to this versus spectrum and other things as Brett asked.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Absolutely, Brett. One of the things that we had underpinned at Analyst Day is that it's up to $65 billion of free cash flow that's going to support the $60 billion of potential shareholder remuneration. And within that, we had some room and had reserved some capacity for spectrum purchases and other things. And of course, we'll fundamentally continue throughout this whole period, one to deliver because the underlying delivery of the free cash flow is what allows everything to happen. And, of course, always look at opportunities before us for the highest value creation opportunity. With your question on C-band, that was already included in our assumption here. So when we continue to say, we have optimism around the program in totality, C-band is fully contemplated within that.\nBrett Feldman: That's great color. If I can ask a quick follow-up question as we're talking about overall liquidity. Any update on the spectrum option that DISH hold and if that were to get exercised, how do you think about putting that proceeds to work? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sure. Well, the first thing I would point out is that any proceeds from that have not been contemplated in the long-range cash planning. So if there's cash that comes from that soon, that be incremental to the planning expectations. We're still awaiting DISH's decision. So just as an update, and I think our filings made some of this clear. The deadline has come and gone for them to determine whether or not they would exercise their privilege to buy that spectrum for $3.6 billion. But they asked for some additional time of the DOJ and we did not object to that. And so we have committed that we would not terminate their agreement and right to do that at any time before August 11. But in fact, we\u2019re in discussions with DISH about whether or not there might be a win-win that\u2019s different from their initial privilege. And if there is that would be wonderful. But obviously, that deadline is coming. So \u2013 but our view was it was worth taking the extra time, especially since they asked for it in case there\u2019s a bigger win-win to be had here.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nJud Henry: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. That will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Two questions. One, as long as we're on the topic of DISH. Outside of the 800, if the opportunity came up, would you have an appetite for more mid-band spectrum, either from DISH or perhaps any other source. And what we're talking about sort of meaningful size chunks here. And then second, if you could just talk about the pacing and trajectory of fixed wireless, as you now with a little more experience under your belt, as you look out towards your long-term guidance, how do you think about the pacing to get to 8 million or so households?\nMike Sievert: Sounds great. Well, I'll tackle the first one and then maybe hand to Mike Katz for the second one. And I don't mean to be flip, Craig, but I think you've been following us for so long. You know we've never met spectrum, we didn't like. And so of course. And -- but one thing that distinguishes us from other providers is that when we get our hands on spectrum, we put it to work right away for the benefit of the American consumer. And so -- that's not only in the public interest, but that's in the interest of T-Mobile and our customers. And so you see that in how we're deploying so ambitiously the 2.5 gigahertz that are the proceeds of the merger, having built the best 5G network in history on that spectrum acquisition that came through the merger. So look, I mean, we're always on the hunt for other ways to add capacity to our network because it allows us to do amazing things like not only continue to take share and grow and meet ever rising needs of customers on their smartphones, but also to get after the subject of your second question, which is fixed wireless access. And -- to the first part of your second question, nothing has changed in our aspiration. We're still on the hunt for that single-digit penetration. And maybe Mike could comment about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the rate and pace of our growth versus our expectations.\nMichael Katz: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Craig, for the question. We couldn't be happier with what's going on with this HSI business. You probably saw from all of our results, we just crossed over 3.7 million customers in this business. And this pacing that we're on, which we told you last quarter and the quarter before, right around where we were in Q2, right around 500,000 customers. We -- it gives us confidence that the 7 million to 8 million total customers that we committed to at the end of this planning period that we've got high confidence that we're going to get there. One of the things that Mike mentioned in his comments that I think is worth reiterating is, we saw in Q2 again, our highest gross adds. And our gross adds have increased every single quarter since we launched this product. And then again, in Q2, we saw sequential decreases in churn. And I think that really speaks to the fact that this is a great product. It's a great product that customers are really, really loving. And you see that both in this sequential churn decrease, but also just in the overall NPS scores, which continue to be the highest amongst any broadband category in America. So we're really thrilled with where we are with this product.\nMike Sievert: Back to my comments, upfront, I said things have been remarkably consistent with what we rolled out to you at our Analyst Day in '21. This is one of those things. We said we saw a potential here of 7 million to 8 million subscribers based on the excess capacity profile of our built mobile network. That means it\u2019s not capital burdened. And because of that, we can make profit there. And so it plays a role. It\u2019s a single-digit penetration role, and we\u2019re on our way to going and seizing it for the benefit of our shareholders and our customers and it\u2019s right on track.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks.\nJud Henry: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks very much. Wonder if you can give us context on a couple of things? So firstly, how are you thinking about the evolution of upgrades in the second half of the year as we go through a new iPhone cycle? And kind of what have you factored into your guidance on EBITDA for that. It looks like upgrades to the industry have been coming in sort of lower than expected, much lower than historical trends. I'm wondering how that shifts in the second half of the year. And then, wondering if you can give us a little bit more context on fixed virus broadband churn. You mentioned that it's come down sequentially, which isn't surprising in that it's always lower in the broadband market in the second quarter. But what does it look like on a year-over-year basis? Maybe you can give us some context around the kind of levels that it's at for the mature portion of the base that's been with you maybe for a year or more.\nMike Sievert: Yeah, Jonathan. You're spot on in the premise of the question that looking at the aging of the base is the way to get at it. We'll come to Mike on that in a minute. But first, on upgrades, historically low upgrades, Peter, what's contemplated for the rest of the year and maybe a little commentary on why do we think we're seeing that.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Well, let me start with why do we think we're seeing that. And fundamentally, we believe we're meeting customers' needs and desires. And if you look at what we've talked about from a network perspective and a value perspective, it makes a lot of sense. You come onto this network and you have a 5G device. Remember about two-thirds of our postpaid base already has a 5G device. And they get experience on this network that is just phenomenal in the broadest sense of the word, much more than the competitive sense can bring. And we think we're just meeting their natural demand. Customers are happy with their devices. They're happy with their devices from a longer perspective, Remember, we continue to have two-year financing constructs, so they have the ability to upgrade earlier than the competition, one of the unlocks of Phone Freedom that we put out there that led to the port ratio changes. So fundamentally, we think we're exactly meeting what customers need. In regards to the second half, the second half always tends to have slightly higher upgrade rates. And you mentioned that you have new product introduction from Apple. You tend to have promotional constructs and a little bit higher switching in the second half, and we're typically the beneficiary of that. We also obviously make very, very solid offers to our base from an upgrade perspective. So we do have higher upgrade rates contemplated than what we saw in Q2, but we don't specifically guide to those other than directionally.\nMike Sievert: Okay. And Mike, over to you on a little bit more color on high-speed Internet churn.\nMichael Katz: Yeah. I mean I think building on what you're saying, Mike, what -- we have the youngest base of broadband customers in America. And like I think we said in a couple of calls, the churn curves that we see for customers like in our mobile business tends to be higher in the earlier tenure months and then reduces as customers achieve greater tenure lengths with us. And we're seeing the exact same thing in our broadband business. And customers that have been with us for some months, their churn has decreased to the point that was right where we expected it. So it's looking right on where our plan was, and the behavior has been just right in line with what we expected.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Terrific. And maybe, Jud, tell us when it\u2019s time to go to Twitter. So we\u2019re not ignoring the people coming in on Twitter because we always do some of that as well. And \u2013 but while you\u2019re thinking about it, we\u2019ll go operator to one more online.\nOperator: That will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. Two questions, if I could. First, on margins. Obviously, a lot of progress there at 300 basis points, but you guys still trail AT&T and Verizon by about 500 basis points. And do you see that closing over time or is it really just a bunch sort of lower ARPU and in fact or sub growth? That's number one. And number two, Mike, I think you said that your porting versus cable has improved. And I don't think you've called that out before. But maybe just some commentary about what you're seeing in terms of competition in wireless and cable. I mean, they're talking about sort of more and more bundled offerings. And I guess Comcast was sort of flattish on a year-over-year basis, but just what the posture is there and what's driving that improvement in porting from cable? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. I'll take that one, but Peter, we'll start with you.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. Certainly, on the margin question, it's a lot more than an ARPU differential. It's really some structural differences that we always call out. For example, the whole leased versus own the backhaul strategy. The other thing that'll always note is that with this significant higher switching that we see and the net add production that we're giving, obviously, we have more S in SG&A than the competition does. We have a very dense network built out. So there's fundamental some structural differences that also mean there's a CapEx OpEx differential and when you compare AT&T and Verizon and us. And that's why it's always important to fundamentally look at conversion of service revenue into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the value generation engine that allows you to further invest, return capital to shareholders or do all sorts of other things to create value. And that is the measure by which we're really comparing ourselves to the competition to get rid of all the structural noise. And on that regard, you heard what we announced today already there from a year-to-date basis in terms of beating them on the conversion ratio when next year anticipated to expand that ratio further. So that's how I think about margins.\nMike Sievert: It's interesting that when you listen to Peter that and you hear that even with our superior growth and our lower prices, both of which hit margins, we have the superior cash production per service revenue dollar in the industry year-to-date and that's rapidly expanding. 75% year-over-year guide, this year, you're on our way to higher cash flows next year. And so it really shows you the power of this model based on this team's ability to execute, but also based on the balance sheet, the incredible assets that we control, the track record of execution, the head start and many other benefits. Okay. Great. The second one was -- second one was cable. So John, let me come back to that. Yeah. We did make a very light comment on it, but it was light that we had been seeing improvements in our port ratios with cable last quarter because we wanted to provide some commentary because cable and Q4 started to see some pretty big net add trajectory changes. And so we kind of double clicked into that. Because you kind of have to do that as a competitor to figure out, is this going to come from us or what's going on. And it's kind of interesting, you fast forward to this quarter. And I'll remind you that even in a world where cable is now a pretty big share taker in overall postpaid, T-Mobile produced the highest postpaid phone net additions for Q2 in eight years and not only the lowest churn ever in our history, but the lowest in the industry. And that kind of answers a question as to whether or not this dynamic from cable is coming from our side, right? I mean we're performing better than before they were in the industry. But obviously, there's a dynamic that affects others, both of our two look-a-like competitors, plus prepaid. There's a lot of brands that have been affected by this, and they're viable competitors to be taken seriously. But it's just, as you can see in our performance, not affecting our results. Okay. John, do we -- what do we have coming in online?\nJud Henry: We've got a question from Roger Entner on how strong was the business growth this quarter. Maybe we can and tee that one up. And then we've got a follow-on question around enterprise sector as well so we can hit those.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. So Roger Entner asked how strong was business growth this quarter. Can you talk about the VA? And any additional color on overall business growth. We also have Chetan Sharma (ph) coming in. Congrats on another great quarter. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on traction you're seeing in the enterprise sector beyond connectivity. What about vertical industries, people using 5G, 5G advanced services, et cetera. So maybe, Callie, why don't you start on both of those and anybody else can jump in.\nCallie Field: Okay. Thanks, Mike. And thanks, Roger, and Chetan for the questions. As Mike mentioned earlier, we delivered on our highest phone net adds and lowest phone churn ever, handily being Verizon again. And we're seeing profitable growth in all three segments. In SMB, we achieved positive port trends against AT&T and this makes five consecutive quarters against Verizon and we grew ARPU quarter-over-quarter again. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, in enterprise and in government, our business is good business with very profitable CLVs, but roughly 60% to 70% relative to consumer and they're rising year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. And Q2 for enterprise, for instance, we welcomed both the largest global asset management firm and yet another leading global bank as new accounts. We also added two huge government contracts with the EPA and the IRS and continue to double our net adds quarter-over-quarter with first responders, most significantly in rural areas where an older LTE network just doesn't cut it for critical response. So a lot of really good growth this quarter from an incredible team in the business group. And then for the VA question, if I could just take that one for a second. I wanted to say, as you may remember, we took Verizon share back in 2018. And now because of our network, we've taken the pole position and have added roughly 20,000 phones year-to-date supporting more than 50% of the VA phones today. And I'll note to our contract also includes T-Mobile's 5G Internet for the VAs community-based outpatient clinics. So we're able to provide health care for veterans in rural areas because of the network that we have built. So just wanted to add some clarity on the VA subject. And then one last thing on use cases for 5G applications outside of pure connectivity. I'll start Chetan with some of the verticals where we're seeing the most traction. And that would be in retail, where we many use cases for fixed 5G solutions where people are looking to look at better costs and less truck rolls and support or perhaps older wireline services and are replacing that with T-Mobile's 5G in multiunit national retailers. And then in health care, this is another area where we're seeing CTOs and CIOs from large hospitals come to us and say, look, we need ubiquitous connectivity, both indoor and outdoor. We need more of a programmable network. We need certain places in our buildings where we want to designate private networks. And because of our public 5G network and the solutions that we can offer with our stand-alone core, we're able to offer a hybrid solution that's really working in a place like a hospital that has lots of different variations to the types of connectivity they need. And then lastly, I'll say we're seeing some traction in education. Large campuses that want to provide connectivity for their students, but also ways to use their data differently and to get in all of the dorms and places in the campus and rooms and libraries and perhaps older buildings, where there's really a need for ubiquitous coverage throughout the campus. So for the 3 hours that really pop out to me. The last one I would say is in the federal use cases with the Department of Defense were not a surprise to anyone, lots of areas for us to begin to deploy hybrid networks and private networks for use cases specific to the military.\nMike Sievert: Well, hopefully, that answers it and more. I mean if you listen to Callie, it just reinforces what I said in my upfront remarks, which is some of the biggest and most sophisticated and profitable customers are choosing T-Mobile because of the sophistication of our advanced network capabilities and our ability to translate that into solutions for their business. And that's just so different from where we were a few years ago. It's a complete 180 in and it's fueling momentum. In fact, all-time record results in our business group. So hopefully, that answers the question, guys. Terrific. Should we go back to the phones?\nJud Henry: Let\u2019s do it. Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. That will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Hi, Mike. The wireless industry is still running maybe hotter than many expected at the beginning of the year. Certainly, your momentum is strong. Are you seeing improving porting ratios versus other MNOs and maybe the MVNOs or do you think there's a growing mix of customers who are coming in without a phone history or a number? And then second, if I can, CapEx, Mike, you talked about tapering in the second half. Does that jumping off rate in the fourth quarter indicate a much lower '24 CapEx level. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. I'm going to let Peter answer the second CapEx question. The first one is really interesting. The answer to the question is yes and yes. Both are true. So yes, our port ratios are improving each and every month since we launched Phone Freedom against each and every competitor, including cable overall and cable individually. And that's a really interesting fact that it shows that not only are people starting to discover our network advantages, which has sort of been a slow improvement over the last 1.5 years. But we have really sparked intrigue with consumers around this idea that we can free them from being trapped with the other guys. And cable in some ways, actually is helpful in that in a dynamic competitive industry, more people are jump balls. And more people are saying, should I be with one of those two look like kind of old line providers? Or should I be with somebody new? And when they get asked that question, they are picking cable by and large. They're picking T-Mobile, as you saw we had the industry-leading postpaid phone net additions. Now what is happening is cable is growing very rapidly and faster than I think a lot of people expected. But specifically to your premise of your question, our port ratios with cable have been improving for year-over-year for nine quarters in a row. And what you see is that the big step forward they started to take in Q4, according to our analysis, about 80% of the year-over-year increment in their performance from the same period a year ago, Q4, Q1 and Q2 is from non-ports. So they're actually not growing the porting side of their business at the same rate as the non-porting side of their business, instead kind of printing postpaid ads. They might be coming over from prepaid. They might be just simply net new. They might be kind of dropped in the bag. I don't really know. There's probably several different factors to it. And we just -- we don't know quite how to unpack it because we don't have all the information. I mean, we double-click into things like Verizon's wholesale revenue and note that it's not growing. That's sort of an interesting diagnostic for us that helps us understand what might be happening. So anyway, hopefully, that helps it. Our industry-leading account growth of 299,000 shows that T-Mobile is winning the switching decisions in high-quality prime paying families, the kind everybody is going for.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. And on CapEx, Phil, the way I think about next year, although we're not specifically guiding is we're still comfortable in the 9 to 10 range that we gave out. Remember, I wouldn't take Q4 as a jumping-off point because really, the way Ulf and team have built this is a very lean manufacturing approach to the build one of the secrets to our capital efficiency there. And so it isn't that I take a run rate and an exit run rate and projected, but $9 billion to $10 billion feels about right for next year at this point in time.\nMike Sievert: On speaking of a lean network performance machine, I think it would be a good time to just stop and take note of what's been delivered with this incredibly capital-efficient profile that you're asking about. Ulf and team, you guys deserve incredible credit. We've now reached 285 million people with ultra-capacity 5G. This is something that neither of our competitors -- principal competitors have promised to ever do, certainly not in the next two years. And so we've been talking about this idea of being two or more years ahead in the 5G race. But if anything, it's expanding. Maybe you could share a few of the statistics of kind of where we are and also a little shadowing of where we're going.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Well, thanks, Mike. And yes, the last quarter, we actually pulled ahead in our leadership. And 285 mid-band POPs, we're heading towards 300 by the end of this year. We have to remember that we reached 200 mid-band POPs two years ago in 2021. On our low band, we reached 300 two years ago, where others are now pulling into the station. It gets harder and harder with the POPs as you grow through every 100 million POPs takes about 3 times the efforts in terms of upgrading and building new towers to be able to deliver the same POP growth. So this network is just fantastic and we are so proud of it, and we're proud to support also what Callie commented on earlier, 5G being capable of not only being that tremendous consumer driver, it also drives now more and more of the business inside the enterprise space, which is a dream for Oliver [indiscernible], who has followed the 5G for many, many years. On top of that, we have lots of room to move ahead. We have today 255 megahertz of spectrum that is dedicated to 5G on our mid-band. And you have to remember that our low band is all dedicated to 5G. When others are talking about their coverage, they're sharing this between LTE and 5G, and we're not -- we're dedicating spectrum. The mid-band megahertz will grow to 200 megahertz dedicated to 5G by the end of the year by migrating more LTE spectrum over to 5G. And then we haven't even started on what we can use for '24 and beyond, which is our C-band. We can use our 345 auction results. We can use our 108 auction results, which is enhancing our 2.5 capabilities even more, and we have yet to re-farm spectrum, for example, on AWS as well. So there is just so much more for us to run at and I couldn't be more excited that we're extending our lead in terms of our network.\nMike Sievert: Well, it's a good thing you are because we're filling it up. So what's interesting is that with 3.7 million high-speed Internet customers and rapidly growing, the average speeds on our network are not just twice as fast as our competitors, but growing. We're speeding up, not slowing down on this network in terms of the average person's lived experience. And that's just phenomenal. And it's -- and we've got tons of capacity that we have not yet rolled out, which opens up more and more opportunity on our way to not only the 7 million to 8 million high-speed Internet customers, but our ability to, with the best network, continue to take share from our competitors. We said at the beginning, we had a two plus year advantage, and we would have it for the duration of the 5G era, and you\u2019re proving us right with that work. So thank you. Operator?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSimon Flannery: Great. thanks a lot. Good evening. Just following up, if I could, on that spectrum deployment. I think in the past, you've talked about rolling out fixed wireless to a majority of the U.S. Perhaps you could just help us understand where you are on coverage today with the base offer and how that should evolve over time now that you're at 285 going to 300. And I guess a related question is for Ulf. You didn't mention the millimeter wave. I know you've been looking at potentially a macro overlay product. How are you thinking about that at the moment or attacking MDUs with millimeter wave. Thanks.\nMike Sievert : Well, let's start with the millimeter wave question and we can come back to the coverage on fixed wireless. I can touch on that one.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Right. So we are actually using millimeter wave today. We have deployments that we early on started off in Manhattan, for example, in Los Angeles in some areas where we really have that extraordinary capacity need we can use the tool of millimeter wave. Our general strategy is not based on millimeter wave. It's based on a macro strategy, which is our layered approach, we're our low band in our mid-band and now also being our PCS spectrum for 5G. But millimeter wave could also be potentially an interesting play for us when it comes to enhancing capacities that could be used, for example, for HSI. And we are working with our vendors, and we are working through our OEMs to figure out if we can make a viable economic and technical performance case out of that with them.\nMike Sievert: And that kind of bridges to your second question. Maybe this is a good time to remind everybody how our capacity model works for fixed wireless access. Essentially, right now, we serve about the potential of about 50 million homes, but they're not in certain geographies. They're geographically dispersed all over the U.S. because the way our model works is we're selling excess capacity sector by sector. And so what we do is study every sector from every tower in our network and determine what amount of normative smartphone usage will there be over the next several years. And in areas where there's still excess capacity, we today approve applicants for home Internet use. And right now, there's about 50 million home addresses, where if you were to go into our tool and apply to be our customer, we'd say, yes, out of the 145 million in the country. But what's interesting is if you and several of your neighbors all did the same, the end person would get a no because it's a dynamic model. What we're selling is excess capacity. And because of that, what we -- our modeling shows us that we will get to, as we said at the very beginning, about 7 million or 8 million households with this excess capacity model that's not burdened by capital. And since it's not burdened by capital with an already built mobile network that you need for great coverage and competitiveness, we're able to profitably build this business at very low prices. It's just a win-win for a sort of single-digit penetration part of the market. Now to the premise of your question and what Ulf was getting into, of course, we're studying whether there are ways to go beyond that initial excess capacity capital free model, capital-free ish model. And we haven't drawn any conclusions about that yet. I mean, we're looking hard at millimeter wave. We're looking at whether or not dedicating mid-band spectrum to HSI would make sense, whether they're nonstandard-based solutions. And we just haven't drawn any conclusions. It's not immediately obvious that there are economic ways to grow this business beyond its initial single-digit penetration. But you may see us doing trials in the marketplace as we experiment with this and try to crack the code. And so you'll hear about us trying millimeter wave things or MDU strategies or non-standards-based solutions to see if there's a way to get after it. And you see us trialing fiber, whether or not there's a way for our team, our distribution, our brand to add value in the fiber ecosystem and I've made mention of that before. All these things are things we're doing to try to learn. And the good news is we've got some time because we'll hit this kind of initial terminal sizing of HSI, still we've got two more years to run. So our heads are down seeing if there's a way to crack the code on this.\nPeter Osvaldik: And of course, any of the things we do there that we just talked about, a capital burden model or something with fiber or all things that would have to be accretive to our Analyst Day guidance that we put out there.\nMike Sievert: Good. All right. Operator, next question.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nTimothy Horan: Thanks. Just curious, why wouldn't you be raising fixed wireless prices now? It seems like you have very, very strong demand from everything we hear out there and you kind of have somewhat limited supply. And I guess related to that, the Go5G plan, can you give us some color what that means for ARPU growth in the next couple of years? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Let's start with the second one on Go5G and where is ARPU going and ARPA and all that stuff. Peter, we can start with you.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, absolutely. I'll let John comment on the success of Go5GPlus. But as I always say, when we think about ARPU and you saw a sequential increase of about $0.20. And we continue to believe on a year-to-year basis, ARPU will be generally stable. There's probably some potential for sequential increase again from Q2 to Q3. And since it is such a mix-driven metric, and you have to put everything into it, whether we're talking about all the benefits we see from Go5GPlus whether we talk about the benefits we see from a segmented approach, whether it's military, 55 plus and how those might be lower ARPU customers than the average that we see but are high CLV customers coming in very high-quality customers. Similarly, in Business. Business, you tend to get enterprise, government, large accounts that have very, very great CLVs but would have, given the nature of the volume purchasing, lower ARPU. So all of that blends into ARPU that we see is generally stable. But it's the ARPA strategy that we have. It's the switching attracting accounts into T-Mobile and then the land and expand ARPA strategy, which you just saw an exciting update to the guide from plus 1% to slightly over 1% on a year-over-year basis there. And that's really the focus point for us. But -- the question on Go5GPlus, and then I hand it to John for a moment because it's been a phenomenal success.\nJon Freier: Yeah. And then I think, Peter, just to remind everybody, the Go5GPlus is really kind of a front book initiative. We're not going into the base and asking people to migrate to Go5GPlus and doing all of that within the base. It's really kind of a front book initiative. But this is going fantastic. And we had an opportunity to mention this on our Q1 earnings call back on April 27, when we launched phone freedom, Go5G, Go5GPlus in mid-April. And like Mike said a few moments ago, when you look at the overall porting ratios and the attractiveness of this offer, and what's happening that we've increased our porting ratios every month against every competitor and have followed that through so far in July. And over 60% of the accounts that are joining T-Mobile are now subscribing to Go5GPlus. And there's a utility that's different than Magenta MAX in terms of hotspot data that we've increased in terms of high speed, roaming in Mexico and Canada, across North America that we've increased. But the big pain point that I think Go5GPlus is solving is that new and to promise. First of all, paired with the easy unlock in helping people get out of AT&T and Verizon, mostly AT&T given the unlocked devices, helping people get out of that switch in to T-Mobile, but this three-year contract cycle that AT&T and Verizon has. We knew this was a big insight and a big opportunity that even I underestimated how big of a pain point that is, the fact that you can basically go to law school and complete law school faster than you can complete a phone contract at AT&T and Verizon. And so that's a huge pain point in the promise of Go5GPlus of being able to get in a new device same device software as a new customer every two years. It\u2019s a differentiated and unique proposition in the marketplace that\u2019s really different and is really resonating with customers.\nMike Sievert: Well said. Okay. And your last question was about HIS pricing. I\u2019ll just answer it briefly. I don\u2019t normally give sort of forward-looking commentary on pricing. So I\u2019ll answer it this way instead, which is do we see ARPU and are we interested in ARPU enhancement for HIS. And the answer is yes, of course. But generally, when you look at our track record, our philosophy in the past as to how to get about that isn\u2019t to jack up people\u2019s prices, is to add value to their life, bring new services, show them increased offers and let themselves select their way up. And obviously, we\u2019re interested in that in this space.\nTimothy Horan: Okay. Good.\nJud Henry: Next question, please.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Just following on the earlier comment, on some of the integration milestones that you've hit. What are the activities that are left to get to the full synergy run rate of $7.5 billion for this year's guidance, $8 billion next year? And can you unpack and maybe even size some of the opportunities for further cost efficiencies that may be embedded in your multiyear plan to drive that longer-term margin expansion. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great, Michael. Well, let's talk about where we are on synergies this year and what's left to be done. I mean on the what's left to be done front, not much the major milestones are behind us, but that doesn't mean the synergy run rates are quite there yet. So maybe you can comment on that dynamic, Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, exactly. A few things in there. Of course, we said we have a small tail of customers to still get over and that will allow the final decommissioning of systems and things to that, whether it's front office, back office, those are the things that are kind of left to do. Certainly, from a cost perspective, there's a little bit in terms of physical decom while the sites are shut off, there's still physical decom happening. And on the synergy development, as we get from $7.5 billion to the $8 billion next year, really, the big chunk of that is avoided costs. So we'll realize the vast majority of the run rate synergies by the end of this year, which you'd naturally expect given we're saying we're substantially done. And then the shift to next year will be fundamentally those avoided site build costs.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great.\nMichael Rollins: And then just one other. Can you just share how T-Mobile is looking at the role and mix of online distribution and how you're viewing the durability of customers wanting a physical retail location to buy an upgrade devices?\nMike Sievert: Yeah, absolutely. And it kind of goes to the premise of your follow-on question, your initial follow-on question, Michael. I mean, obviously, across consumer markets generally, customers want a transaction that's fast, transparent, simple and mostly digital. And our industry has been very stubborn on that front, mostly due to the complexity of the offers across all the providers. And so that's something that we're very focused on. And I know everybody in the industry is. Our digital capabilities are rapidly improving, especially as it relates to self-service for our customers. It's incredible what's going on left to right in our company as to how we're already applying AI technologies and machine learning to speed things up, serve customers in a better way. And we can get into some examples around that. But because of emerging technologies, there's a lot of potential over the coming years to not only meet customers where they are finally in this industry because we've been kind of slow in this industry due to the complexity of our offers, but also to potentially realize some efficiencies over time. And that's a good thing because the cost of competition is high. And as you've seen over the last few years, it's gone up. And so it's all about us seizing opportunities to be able to continue this formula that works so well. And for us to continue to do what we do with this flywheel of success, we can't sit on our hands. We have to be able to seize new opportunities, not necessarily to outperform the promises we made you. Those promises were really high, fall some promises, but in some cases, to achieve them in light of what we have seen in the past, which is some increased cost of competition. So at the end of the day, it\u2019s great for consumers.\nJud Henry: All right. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: That will come from the line of Rick Prentiss with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nRichard Prentiss: Great. Thank you. Couple of questions. I want to follow up on the private network question. Where do you feel that private networks -- 5G private networks will become a material enough number on the revenues, an associated question do you feel customers, whether it's consumer or enterprise really understand what 5G means for them and why they should choose you with your head start. It just seems like the market is still just kind of like, oh, I'm not sure what 5G is.\nMike Sievert: On the consumer piece, I kind of agree and what people want is a really strong, powerful signal everywhere they go. That's what they want. And 5G is a means for us to get that better than anyone else. Whether or not they give us credit that the thing that got them that was 5G, I really don't care. But we have the highest performing network with incredible reach of the high-performing parts of our network, 5G than anybody else. Like by far, like twice the land mass covered of ultra-capacity 5G than our next closest competitor and rapidly expanding, as Ulf explained. And you're right, they don't really give 5G credit for that. But what they want, make no mistake, is a very powerful signal everywhere they go because they're watching video more than ever, they're glued to their TikTok and their Instagram stories and their sports and their YouTube and their videos and their zooms and they don't want buffering. They want that signal with no latency and no buffering and no jitter and that's the power of 5G, whether they give it credit or not. On the Business side, I'll say the short version, which is we don't really know. I mean whether -- to your question, literally material means something in our company, and that's big. We're a big company. We don't know when it will be bigger than a bread basket, but we do know that we're best positioned to capture it. And as Peter pointed out, back at our Analyst Day, 2-plus years ago, we actually did not, for that reason, factor a lot of revenues in or really any at all from some of these advanced 5G network services. Our strategy was, let's make sure we are best positioned to capture them. And Kelly, I think, very deftly explain some of the things that we're doing in this area with early adopting customers. But when it becomes something that's bigger than a bread basket and really contributes, we don't really know. And because we didn't know, we made you no promises in our long-range plan on it. But I can tell you this promise, as that market develops, we are beautifully positioned to capture it.\nRichard Prentiss: All right. Great. Thank you.\nJud Henry: It looks like we're right at time. So I appreciate everybody joining us today. If you have any further questions, please reach out to either Investor Relations or the media relations department. Again, we look forward to talking to you again soon. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second (ph) quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Absolutely. Thanks, Mike. Q2 was another quarter of best-in-class profitable growth, which underpins the updated guidance that I'll share with you in a moment. It starts with the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up over 5% year-over-year driven by continued increases in both postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in an 11% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by over 300 basis points year-over-year. In addition, free cash flow was up 64% year-over-year and with the highest free cash flow to service revenue margin relative to our peers year-to-date. We expect this to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 25.2 million shares for $3.5 billion in Q2 with a cumulative total of 83.5 million shares repurchased for $11.8 billion as of July 21. All right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 million and 5.9 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect roughly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectation, which we now expect to be between $28.9 billion and $29.2 billion. This is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies and excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year-end. Our merger synergies are expected to be approximately $7.5 billion in 2023, achieving the full run rate synergy target provided at our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the full run rate synergies of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes. And we now expect cash merger related costs of $1.6 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which include payments for merger related costs is now expected to be in the range of $18 billion to $18.3 billion and we now expect cash CapEx to be between $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion delivering a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry, unlocked by our network leadership. We expect CapEx to taper in Q3 and then further in Q4. The slightly higher operating cash flows fund the increased CapEx resulting in strong free cash flow of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion, which includes payments for merger-related costs. This is up approximately 75% over last year, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers with further expansion expected next year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, we now expect full year postpaid ARPA to increase slightly more than the 1% we had previously guided for 2023 as we continue to expand our account relationships across products and services as part of our land and expand account strategy to grow service revenue. Before I wrap up, I want to remind folks that we closed the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent on May 1, which had a partial impact on our results in Q2 and we expect the full run rate impact beginning in Q3 as I laid out last quarter. In closing, we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities to deliver the highest free cash flow conversion in the industry and unlock shareholder value. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Yeah. Absolutely, Brett. One of the things that we had underpinned at Analyst Day is that it's up to $65 billion of free cash flow that's going to support the $60 billion of potential shareholder remuneration. And within that, we had some room and had reserved some capacity for spectrum purchases and other things. And of course, we'll fundamentally continue throughout this whole period, one to deliver because the underlying delivery of the free cash flow is what allows everything to happen. And, of course, always look at opportunities before us for the highest value creation opportunity. With your question on C-band, that was already included in our assumption here. So when we continue to say, we have optimism around the program in totality, C-band is fully contemplated within that. Yeah. Well, let me start with why do we think we're seeing that. And fundamentally, we believe we're meeting customers' needs and desires. And if you look at what we've talked about from a network perspective and a value perspective, it makes a lot of sense. You come onto this network and you have a 5G device. Remember about two-thirds of our postpaid base already has a 5G device. And they get experience on this network that is just phenomenal in the broadest sense of the word, much more than the competitive sense can bring. And we think we're just meeting their natural demand. Customers are happy with their devices. They're happy with their devices from a longer perspective, Remember, we continue to have two-year financing constructs, so they have the ability to upgrade earlier than the competition, one of the unlocks of Phone Freedom that we put out there that led to the port ratio changes. So fundamentally, we think we're exactly meeting what customers need. In regards to the second half, the second half always tends to have slightly higher upgrade rates. And you mentioned that you have new product introduction from Apple. You tend to have promotional constructs and a little bit higher switching in the second half, and we're typically the beneficiary of that. We also obviously make very, very solid offers to our base from an upgrade perspective. So we do have higher upgrade rates contemplated than what we saw in Q2, but we don't specifically guide to those other than directionally. Yeah. Certainly, on the margin question, it's a lot more than an ARPU differential. It's really some structural differences that we always call out. For example, the whole leased versus own the backhaul strategy. The other thing that'll always note is that with this significant higher switching that we see and the net add production that we're giving, obviously, we have more S in SG&A than the competition does. We have a very dense network built out. So there's fundamental some structural differences that also mean there's a CapEx OpEx differential and when you compare AT&T and Verizon and us. And that's why it's always important to fundamentally look at conversion of service revenue into free cash flow. Free cash flow is the value generation engine that allows you to further invest, return capital to shareholders or do all sorts of other things to create value. And that is the measure by which we're really comparing ourselves to the competition to get rid of all the structural noise. And on that regard, you heard what we announced today already there from a year-to-date basis in terms of beating them on the conversion ratio when next year anticipated to expand that ratio further. So that's how I think about margins. Yeah. And on CapEx, Phil, the way I think about next year, although we're not specifically guiding is we're still comfortable in the 9 to 10 range that we gave out. Remember, I wouldn't take Q4 as a jumping-off point because really, the way Ulf and team have built this is a very lean manufacturing approach to the build one of the secrets to our capital efficiency there. And so it isn't that I take a run rate and an exit run rate and projected, but $9 billion to $10 billion feels about right for next year at this point in time. And of course, any of the things we do there that we just talked about, a capital burden model or something with fiber or all things that would have to be accretive to our Analyst Day guidance that we put out there. Yeah, absolutely. I'll let John comment on the success of Go5GPlus. But as I always say, when we think about ARPU and you saw a sequential increase of about $0.20. And we continue to believe on a year-to-year basis, ARPU will be generally stable. There's probably some potential for sequential increase again from Q2 to Q3. And since it is such a mix-driven metric, and you have to put everything into it, whether we're talking about all the benefits we see from Go5GPlus whether we talk about the benefits we see from a segmented approach, whether it's military, 55 plus and how those might be lower ARPU customers than the average that we see but are high CLV customers coming in very high-quality customers. Similarly, in Business. Business, you tend to get enterprise, government, large accounts that have very, very great CLVs but would have, given the nature of the volume purchasing, lower ARPU. So all of that blends into ARPU that we see is generally stable. But it's the ARPA strategy that we have. It's the switching attracting accounts into T-Mobile and then the land and expand ARPA strategy, which you just saw an exciting update to the guide from plus 1% to slightly over 1% on a year-over-year basis there. And that's really the focus point for us. But -- the question on Go5GPlus, and then I hand it to John for a moment because it's been a phenomenal success. Yes, exactly. A few things in there. Of course, we said we have a small tail of customers to still get over and that will allow the final decommissioning of systems and things to that, whether it's front office, back office, those are the things that are kind of left to do.

            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Craig, for the question. We couldn't be happier with what's going on with this HSI business. You probably saw from all of our results, we just crossed over 3.7 million customers in this business. And this pacing that we're on, which we told you last quarter and the quarter before, right around where we were in Q2, right around 500,000 customers. We -- it gives us confidence that the 7 million to 8 million total customers that we committed to at the end of this planning period that we've got high confidence that we're going to get there. One of the things that Mike mentioned in his comments that I think is worth reiterating is, we saw in Q2 again, our highest gross adds. And our gross adds have increased every single quarter since we launched this product. And then again, in Q2, we saw sequential decreases in churn. And I think that really speaks to the fact that this is a great product. It's a great product that customers are really, really loving. And you see that both in this sequential churn decrease, but also just in the overall NPS scores, which continue to be the highest amongst any broadband category in America. So we're really thrilled with where we are with this product. Yeah. I mean I think building on what you're saying, Mike, what -- we have the youngest base of broadband customers in America. And like I think we said in a couple of calls, the churn curves that we see for customers like in our mobile business tends to be higher in the earlier tenure months and then reduces as customers achieve greater tenure lengths with us. And we're seeing the exact same thing in our broadband business. And customers that have been with us for some months, their churn has decreased to the point that was right where we expected it. So it's looking right on where our plan was, and the behavior has been just right in line with what we expected."

            "name": "Callie Field",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Mike. And thanks, Roger, and Chetan for the questions. As Mike mentioned earlier, we delivered on our highest phone net adds and lowest phone churn ever, handily being Verizon again. And we're seeing profitable growth in all three segments. In SMB, we achieved positive port trends against AT&T and this makes five consecutive quarters against Verizon and we grew ARPU quarter-over-quarter again. As Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, in enterprise and in government, our business is good business with very profitable CLVs, but roughly 60% to 70% relative to consumer and they're rising year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. And Q2 for enterprise, for instance, we welcomed both the largest global asset management firm and yet another leading global bank as new accounts. We also added two huge government contracts with the EPA and the IRS and continue to double our net adds quarter-over-quarter with first responders, most significantly in rural areas where an older LTE network just doesn't cut it for critical response. So a lot of really good growth this quarter from an incredible team in the business group. And then for the VA question, if I could just take that one for a second. I wanted to say, as you may remember, we took Verizon share back in 2018. And now because of our network, we've taken the pole position and have added roughly 20,000 phones year-to-date supporting more than 50% of the VA phones today. And I'll note to our contract also includes T-Mobile's 5G Internet for the VAs community-based outpatient clinics. So we're able to provide health care for veterans in rural areas because of the network that we have built. So just wanted to add some clarity on the VA subject. And then one last thing on use cases for 5G applications outside of pure connectivity. I'll start Chetan with some of the verticals where we're seeing the most traction. And that would be in retail, where we many use cases for fixed 5G solutions where people are looking to look at better costs and less truck rolls and support or perhaps older wireline services and are replacing that with T-Mobile's 5G in multiunit national retailers. And then in health care, this is another area where we're seeing CTOs and CIOs from large hospitals come to us and say, look, we need ubiquitous connectivity, both indoor and outdoor. We need more of a programmable network. We need certain places in our buildings where we want to designate private networks. And because of our public 5G network and the solutions that we can offer with our stand-alone core, we're able to offer a hybrid solution that's really working in a place like a hospital that has lots of different variations to the types of connectivity they need. And then lastly, I'll say we're seeing some traction in education. Large campuses that want to provide connectivity for their students, but also ways to use their data differently and to get in all of the dorms and places in the campus and rooms and libraries and perhaps older buildings, where there's really a need for ubiquitous coverage throughout the campus. So for the 3 hours that really pop out to me. The last one I would say is in the federal use cases with the Department of Defense were not a surprise to anyone, lots of areas for us to begin to deploy hybrid networks and private networks for use cases specific to the military."

            "name": "Ulf Ewaldsson",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Mike. And yes, the last quarter, we actually pulled ahead in our leadership. And 285 mid-band POPs, we're heading towards 300 by the end of this year. We have to remember that we reached 200 mid-band POPs two years ago in 2021. On our low band, we reached 300 two years ago, where others are now pulling into the station. It gets harder and harder with the POPs as you grow through every 100 million POPs takes about 3 times the efforts in terms of upgrading and building new towers to be able to deliver the same POP growth. So this network is just fantastic and we are so proud of it, and we're proud to support also what Callie commented on earlier, 5G being capable of not only being that tremendous consumer driver, it also drives now more and more of the business inside the enterprise space, which is a dream for Oliver [indiscernible], who has followed the 5G for many, many years. On top of that, we have lots of room to move ahead. We have today 255 megahertz of spectrum that is dedicated to 5G on our mid-band. And you have to remember that our low band is all dedicated to 5G. When others are talking about their coverage, they're sharing this between LTE and 5G, and we're not -- we're dedicating spectrum. The mid-band megahertz will grow to 200 megahertz dedicated to 5G by the end of the year by migrating more LTE spectrum over to 5G. And then we haven't even started on what we can use for '24 and beyond, which is our C-band. We can use our 345 auction results. We can use our 108 auction results, which is enhancing our 2.5 capabilities even more, and we have yet to re-farm spectrum, for example, on AWS as well. So there is just so much more for us to run at and I couldn't be more excited that we're extending our lead in terms of our network. Right. So we are actually using millimeter wave today. We have deployments that we early on started off in Manhattan, for example, in Los Angeles in some areas where we really have that extraordinary capacity need we can use the tool of millimeter wave. Our general strategy is not based on millimeter wave. It's based on a macro strategy, which is our layered approach, we're our low band in our mid-band and now also being our PCS spectrum for 5G. But millimeter wave could also be potentially an interesting play for us when it comes to enhancing capacities that could be used, for example, for HSI. And we are working with our vendors, and we are working through our OEMs to figure out if we can make a viable economic and technical performance case out of that with them."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. As you can see, we're here with several members of our senior management team. We're coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington and we're ready to take your questions. But first, let me share just a few comments. If you'll recall at our Analyst Day in early 2021, we shared our strategy to build the best network, couple it with a leading un-carrier value proposition and customer experience and grow our share in areas where T-Mobile was massively underpenetrated relative to our peers. That strategy and our approach has remained remarkably consistent and our Q2 results continue to show that it's working better than ever. In fact, T-Mobile delivered our highest Q2 postpaid phone net adds in eight years, fueled by both industry leading gross adds and the lowest postpaid phone churn in company history. And importantly, we did this while industry growth normalized, proving that the growth opportunities and durable advantages we've been sharing with you really are unique to T-Mobile. We also told you that if we delivered the best product and the best value and the best experiences, there was no reason we couldn't get to the lowest churn in the industry, remember that. And in Q2, we did it. For the first time in our history, T-Mobile reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry. That is a remarkable statement and it's a testament to the work our team has done to build the best network. And to further our value proposition to deliver even better experiences to customers. Now I'm sure there's still going to be some back and forth between us and the other guys before we consistently put them in the rearview mirror for good on churn, but all the same, it is great to get this first win. We also continue to run the business in a smart and sustainable manner, translating our industry leading customer growth in Q2 into industry leading service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth, while growing free cash flow by more than 60% year-over-year. This industry leading customer and financial growth led us to raise guidance for the year again. And we're fortunate to deliver these industry leading results within the context of a vibrant wireless industry, with growing industry service revenues and industry cash flows and healthy competition that continues to deliver more value and better networks to customers. In fact, on network, we not only defended, but extended our leadership in both overall and 5G performance. With the latest third-party reports showing that T-Mobile's lead is widening. Looking at Ookla data. T-Mobile once again swept every category for overall network performance with median download speeds, more than double our closest competitor. We've long talked about how our dedicated 5G spectrum assets with superior propagation would result in a demonstrable advantage in customers' everyday lived experiences even as the competitors try to catch us. T-Mobile's head start, our dedicated 5G spectrum assets and our technology leadership are the things that allow us to stay meaningfully ahead as in like two years or more ahead in 5G reach and overall network performance and to stay ahead for years to come. And the most exciting part is that many prospective customers are only just beginning to notice, which means lots of the benefit from this is in front of us. And importantly, these things also allow it to do it all with the best capital efficiency in the industry. Now we also continue to build on our fame for providing the best value. Our latest un-carrier move Phone Freedom, freeze customers locked up into those 3-year contracts at the carriers. And our new go 5G plus rate plan delivers the best value in wireless. The response from customers has been really amazing. In fact, Go5G Plus instantly became our most popular plan, and we're seeing improved porting ratios against every competitor including yet another quarter of year-over-year improvement against cable. In fact, total postpaid porting ratios for us have improved every month since we launched Phone Freedom including in July. As more and more customers learn that they can break free from those three-year contracts come to a better network and get a better value at T-Mobile. All of these catalysts, coupled with our unique growth opportunities in underpenetrated markets are what enable a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition and you're seeing it again in these Q2 results. We added 299,000 postpaid account net adds, the highest reported in the industry showing that we continue to win the switching decisions in the market. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.6 million again leading the industry by a wide margin. This included postpaid phone net adds of 760,000, our highest Q2 in eight years, even as the industry sees more normalized levels of growth. Our increased share was driven by our industry best phone gross adds, which grew over last year's Q2 as well as the lowest postpaid phone churn in our history. And as I mentioned, the lowest in the industry for the first time ever at just 0.77%. In T-Mobile for Business, we had a record quarter with best ever phone net adds and our lowest ever phone churn. Enterprise and government customers buy based on their own rigorous testing of the networks, not just price, and our network leadership, innovative solutions and customer experiences are driving major wins and fueling our momentum in these segments. We're attracting profitable customers with CLVs in the hundreds of dollars each and still growing. As I mentioned, consumers are beginning to take notice of our network strides as well, as we're winning prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity to meet their needs. We saw our share of switchers in the top 100 markets increase both sequentially and year-over-year. In smaller markets and rural areas, where we continue to bring the first and in many places, only 5G network, we're seeing an incredible response. We're capturing a win share of switchers in these areas in the upper 30s, which shows we're not only on track to meet our goal of 20% share in 2025, but it gives us confidence we have room to run in the years beyond. In addition to mobile wireless, we added 509,000 high speed Internet customers. Notably, we've continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched over two years ago as demand for the product just continues to grow. And we saw a sequential improvement in churn again this quarter and Net Promoter Scores that remain multiples higher than cable, demonstrating how our high speed Internet resonates with and satisfies an important target audience within this larger broadband market. We also celebrated another major milestone in our Sprint merger integration as we are now substantially complete with both the billing migration and retail rationalization, well ahead of our year-end target. At every step of our integration journey, the customer has been our primary focus. As you know, this has allowed us to not only unlock synergies bigger and faster than expected, but also to deliver industry leading growth and record low churn at the same time. I could not be more proud of what our team has accomplished in this area. Okay. I'm going to wrap it up. We are pulling into the station halfway 2023 with great momentum. Our postpaid phone net adds year-to-date are right on track with last year, which was a growth record year for us. We continue to extend our durable network and value leadership over the competition, which fuels our growth opportunities. And our profitable growth strategy continues to translate into the highest core adjusted EBITDA growth and year-to-date cash flow conversion in the industry. Listen, in our industry, change is a constant, but our team navigates it definitely with the customer as our North Star. And because of that, there has never been a more exciting time to be at T-Mobile. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance for 2023. That sounds great. Thanks, Brett. I'll start and then maybe hand it to Peter for some comments. The way I think about it is, we're buying at a pace through -- mostly through predesigned 10b5-1 programs in order to be able to meet the authorization during the time frame of the authorization. So if you recall, the initial authorization of this program is a $14 billion program that takes us through September. And if you look at some of our activity early in the year where we were able to grab some additional run rate. Now the remaining funds relative to the remaining time suggests a run rate where we have it. So it's not really a downtick so much as just kind of a programmatic view. And then -- and maybe Peter can pile in on the second part. The way we think about it broadly is that there's essentially been no underlying change to the thesis we've been communicating all along. Now our Board hasn't made a determination yet about the second step, but the inputs to those steps have to do with the free cash flow development of this company, which, as you mentioned in the premise of your question is right on track. We're guiding to 75% year-over-year cash flow growth this year. And the underpinnings of the growth in the business, as you saw from our fantastic Q2 momentum suggests another good year in '24. And so -- as the cash flow develops, that's what gives us the confidence that, that original thesis of around $60 billion through 2025 is intact. But maybe you can also comment, Peter, on kind of how we think about this from a dedication of resources to this versus spectrum and other things as Brett asked. Sure. Well, the first thing I would point out is that any proceeds from that have not been contemplated in the long-range cash planning. So if there's cash that comes from that soon, that be incremental to the planning expectations. We're still awaiting DISH's decision. So just as an update, and I think our filings made some of this clear. The deadline has come and gone for them to determine whether or not they would exercise their privilege to buy that spectrum for $3.6 billion. But they asked for some additional time of the DOJ and we did not object to that. And so we have committed that we would not terminate their agreement and right to do that at any time before August 11. But in fact, we're in discussions with DISH about whether or not there might be a win-win that's different from their initial privilege. And if there is that would be wonderful. But obviously, that deadline is coming. So \u2013 but our view was it was worth taking the extra time, especially since they asked for it in case there's a bigger win-win to be had here. Sounds great. Well, I'll tackle the first one and then maybe hand to Mike Katz for the second one. And I don't mean to be flip, Craig, but I think you've been following us for so long. You know we've never met spectrum, we didn't like. And so of course. And -- but one thing that distinguishes us from other providers is that when we get our hands on spectrum, we put it to work right away for the benefit of the American consumer. And so -- that's not only in the public interest, but that's in the interest of T-Mobile and our customers. And so you see that in how we're deploying so ambitiously the 2.5 gigahertz that are the proceeds of the merger, having built the best 5G network in history on that spectrum acquisition that came through the merger. So look, I mean, we're always on the hunt for other ways to add capacity to our network because it allows us to do amazing things like not only continue to take share and grow and meet ever rising needs of customers on their smartphones, but also to get after the subject of your second question, which is fixed wireless access. And -- to the first part of your second question, nothing has changed in our aspiration. We're still on the hunt for that single-digit penetration. And maybe Mike could comment about what we're seeing in the marketplace and the rate and pace of our growth versus our expectations. Back to my comments, upfront, I said things have been remarkably consistent with what we rolled out to you at our Analyst Day in '21. This is one of those things. We said we saw a potential here of 7 million to 8 million subscribers based on the excess capacity profile of our built mobile network. That means it's not capital burdened. And because of that, we can make profit there. And so it plays a role. It's a single-digit penetration role, and we're on our way to going and seizing it for the benefit of our shareholders and our customers and it's right on track. Yeah, Jonathan. You're spot on in the premise of the question that looking at the aging of the base is the way to get at it. We'll come to Mike on that in a minute. But first, on upgrades, historically low upgrades, Peter, what's contemplated for the rest of the year and maybe a little commentary on why do we think we're seeing that. Okay. And Mike, over to you on a little bit more color on high-speed Internet churn. Okay. Terrific. And maybe, Jud, tell us when it's time to go to Twitter. So we're not ignoring the people coming in on Twitter because we always do some of that as well. And \u2013 but while you're thinking about it, we'll go operator to one more online. Okay. I'll take that one, but Peter, we'll start with you. It's interesting that when you listen to Peter that and you hear that even with our superior growth and our lower prices, both of which hit margins, we have the superior cash production per service revenue dollar in the industry year-to-date and that's rapidly expanding. 75% year-over-year guide, this year, you're on our way to higher cash flows next year. And so it really shows you the power of this model based on this team's ability to execute, but also based on the balance sheet, the incredible assets that we control, the track record of execution, the head start and many other benefits. Okay. Great. The second one was -- second one was cable. So John, let me come back to that. Yeah. We did make a very light comment on it, but it was light that we had been seeing improvements in our port ratios with cable last quarter because we wanted to provide some commentary because cable and Q4 started to see some pretty big net add trajectory changes. And so we kind of double clicked into that. Because you kind of have to do that as a competitor to figure out, is this going to come from us or what's going on. And it's kind of interesting, you fast forward to this quarter. And I'll remind you that even in a world where cable is now a pretty big share taker in overall postpaid, T-Mobile produced the highest postpaid phone net additions for Q2 in eight years and not only the lowest churn ever in our history, but the lowest in the industry. And that kind of answers a question as to whether or not this dynamic from cable is coming from our side, right? I mean we're performing better than before they were in the industry. But obviously, there's a dynamic that affects others, both of our two look-a-like competitors, plus prepaid. There's a lot of brands that have been affected by this, and they're viable competitors to be taken seriously. But it's just, as you can see in our performance, not affecting our results. Okay. John, do we -- what do we have coming in online? Okay. Great. So Roger Entner asked how strong was business growth this quarter. Can you talk about the VA? And any additional color on overall business growth. We also have Chetan Sharma (ph) coming in. Congrats on another great quarter. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some color on traction you're seeing in the enterprise sector beyond connectivity. What about vertical industries, people using 5G, 5G advanced services, et cetera. So maybe, Callie, why don't you start on both of those and anybody else can jump in. Well, hopefully, that answers it and more. I mean if you listen to Callie, it just reinforces what I said in my upfront remarks, which is some of the biggest and most sophisticated and profitable customers are choosing T-Mobile because of the sophistication of our advanced network capabilities and our ability to translate that into solutions for their business. And that's just so different from where we were a few years ago. It's a complete 180 in and it's fueling momentum. In fact, all-time record results in our business group. So hopefully, that answers the question, guys. Terrific. Should we go back to the phones? Okay. Great. I'm going to let Peter answer the second CapEx question. The first one is really interesting. The answer to the question is yes and yes. Both are true. So yes, our port ratios are improving each and every month since we launched Phone Freedom against each and every competitor, including cable overall and cable individually. And that's a really interesting fact that it shows that not only are people starting to discover our network advantages, which has sort of been a slow improvement over the last 1.5 years. But we have really sparked intrigue with consumers around this idea that we can free them from being trapped with the other guys. And cable in some ways, actually is helpful in that in a dynamic competitive industry, more people are jump balls. And more people are saying, should I be with one of those two look like kind of old line providers? Or should I be with somebody new? And when they get asked that question, they are picking cable by and large. They're picking T-Mobile, as you saw we had the industry-leading postpaid phone net additions. Now what is happening is cable is growing very rapidly and faster than I think a lot of people expected. But specifically to your premise of your question, our port ratios with cable have been improving for year-over-year for nine quarters in a row. And what you see is that the big step forward they started to take in Q4, according to our analysis, about 80% of the year-over-year increment in their performance from the same period a year ago, Q4, Q1 and Q2 is from non-ports. So they're actually not growing the porting side of their business at the same rate as the non-porting side of their business, instead kind of printing postpaid ads. They might be coming over from prepaid. They might be just simply net new. They might be kind of dropped in the bag. I don't really know. There's probably several different factors to it. And we just -- we don't know quite how to unpack it because we don't have all the information. I mean, we double-click into things like Verizon's wholesale revenue and note that it's not growing. That's sort of an interesting diagnostic for us that helps us understand what might be happening. So anyway, hopefully, that helps it. Our industry-leading account growth of 299,000 shows that T-Mobile is winning the switching decisions in high-quality prime paying families, the kind everybody is going for. On speaking of a lean network performance machine, I think it would be a good time to just stop and take note of what's been delivered with this incredibly capital-efficient profile that you're asking about. Ulf and team, you guys deserve incredible credit. We've now reached 285 million people with ultra-capacity 5G. This is something that neither of our competitors -- principal competitors have promised to ever do, certainly not in the next two years. And so we've been talking about this idea of being two or more years ahead in the 5G race. But if anything, it's expanding. Maybe you could share a few of the statistics of kind of where we are and also a little shadowing of where we're going. Well, it's a good thing you are because we're filling it up. So what's interesting is that with 3.7 million high-speed Internet customers and rapidly growing, the average speeds on our network are not just twice as fast as our competitors, but growing. We're speeding up, not slowing down on this network in terms of the average person's lived experience. And that's just phenomenal. And it's -- and we've got tons of capacity that we have not yet rolled out, which opens up more and more opportunity on our way to not only the 7 million to 8 million high-speed Internet customers, but our ability to, with the best network, continue to take share from our competitors. We said at the beginning, we had a two plus year advantage, and we would have it for the duration of the 5G era, and you're proving us right with that work. So thank you. Operator? Well, let's start with the millimeter wave question and we can come back to the coverage on fixed wireless. I can touch on that one. And that kind of bridges to your second question. Maybe this is a good time to remind everybody how our capacity model works for fixed wireless access. Essentially, right now, we serve about the potential of about 50 million homes, but they're not in certain geographies. They're geographically dispersed all over the U.S. because the way our model works is we're selling excess capacity sector by sector. And so what we do is study every sector from every tower in our network and determine what amount of normative smartphone usage will there be over the next several years. And in areas where there's still excess capacity, we today approve applicants for home Internet use. And right now, there's about 50 million home addresses, where if you were to go into our tool and apply to be our customer, we'd say, yes, out of the 145 million in the country. But what's interesting is if you and several of your neighbors all did the same, the end person would get a no because it's a dynamic model. What we're selling is excess capacity. And because of that, what we -- our modeling shows us that we will get to, as we said at the very beginning, about 7 million or 8 million households with this excess capacity model that's not burdened by capital. And since it's not burdened by capital with an already built mobile network that you need for great coverage and competitiveness, we're able to profitably build this business at very low prices. It's just a win-win for a sort of single-digit penetration part of the market. Now to the premise of your question and what Ulf was getting into, of course, we're studying whether there are ways to go beyond that initial excess capacity capital free model, capital-free ish model. And we haven't drawn any conclusions about that yet. I mean, we're looking hard at millimeter wave. We're looking at whether or not dedicating mid-band spectrum to HSI would make sense, whether they're nonstandard-based solutions. And we just haven't drawn any conclusions. It's not immediately obvious that there are economic ways to grow this business beyond its initial single-digit penetration. But you may see us doing trials in the marketplace as we experiment with this and try to crack the code. And so you'll hear about us trying millimeter wave things or MDU strategies or non-standards-based solutions to see if there's a way to get after it. And you see us trialing fiber, whether or not there's a way for our team, our distribution, our brand to add value in the fiber ecosystem and I've made mention of that before. All these things are things we're doing to try to learn. And the good news is we've got some time because we'll hit this kind of initial terminal sizing of HSI, still we've got two more years to run. So our heads are down seeing if there's a way to crack the code on this. Good. All right. Operator, next question. Okay. Let's start with the second one on Go5G and where is ARPU going and ARPA and all that stuff. Peter, we can start with you. Well said. Okay. And your last question was about HIS pricing. I'll just answer it briefly. I don't normally give sort of forward-looking commentary on pricing. So I'll answer it this way instead, which is do we see ARPU and are we interested in ARPU enhancement for HIS. And the answer is yes, of course. But generally, when you look at our track record, our philosophy in the past as to how to get about that isn't to jack up people's prices, is to add value to their life, bring new services, show them increased offers and let themselves select their way up. And obviously, we're interested in that in this space. Okay. Great, Michael. Well, let's talk about where we are on synergies this year and what's left to be done. I mean on the what's left to be done front, not much the major milestones are behind us, but that doesn't mean the synergy run rates are quite there yet. So maybe you can comment on that dynamic, Peter. Okay. Great. Yeah, absolutely. And it kind of goes to the premise of your follow-on question, your initial follow-on question, Michael. I mean, obviously, across consumer markets generally, customers want a transaction that's fast, transparent, simple and mostly digital. And our industry has been very stubborn on that front, mostly due to the complexity of the offers across all the providers. And so that's something that we're very focused on. And I know everybody in the industry is. Our digital capabilities are rapidly improving, especially as it relates to self-service for our customers. It's incredible what's going on left to right in our company as to how we're already applying AI technologies and machine learning to speed things up, serve customers in a better way. And we can get into some examples around that. But because of emerging technologies, there's a lot of potential over the coming years to not only meet customers where they are finally in this industry because we've been kind of slow in this industry due to the complexity of our offers, but also to potentially realize some efficiencies over time. And that's a good thing because the cost of competition is high. And as you've seen over the last few years, it's gone up. And so it's all about us seizing opportunities to be able to continue this formula that works so well. And for us to continue to do what we do with this flywheel of success, we can't sit on our hands. We have to be able to seize new opportunities, not necessarily to outperform the promises we made you. Those promises were really high, fall some promises, but in some cases, to achieve them in light of what we have seen in the past, which is some increased cost of competition. So at the end of the day, it's great for consumers. On the consumer piece, I kind of agree and what people want is a really strong, powerful signal everywhere they go. That's what they want. And 5G is a means for us to get that better than anyone else. Whether or not they give us credit that the thing that got them that was 5G, I really don't care. But we have the highest performing network with incredible reach of the high-performing parts of our network, 5G than anybody else. Like by far, like twice the land mass covered of ultra-capacity 5G than our next closest competitor and rapidly expanding, as Ulf explained. And you're right, they don't really give 5G credit for that. But what they want, make no mistake, is a very powerful signal everywhere they go because they're watching video more than ever, they're glued to their TikTok and their Instagram stories and their sports and their YouTube and their videos and their zooms and they don't want buffering. They want that signal with no latency and no buffering and no jitter and that's the power of 5G, whether they give it credit or not. On the Business side, I'll say the short version, which is we don't really know. I mean whether -- to your question, literally material means something in our company, and that's big. We're a big company. We don't know when it will be bigger than a bread basket, but we do know that we're best positioned to capture it. And as Peter pointed out, back at our Analyst Day, 2-plus years ago, we actually did not, for that reason, factor a lot of revenues in or really any at all from some of these advanced 5G network services. Our strategy was, let's make sure we are best positioned to capture them. And Kelly, I think, very deftly explain some of the things that we're doing in this area with early adopting customers. But when it becomes something that's bigger than a bread basket and really contributes, we don't really know. And because we didn't know, we made you no promises in our long-range plan on it. But I can tell you this promise, as that market develops, we are beautifully positioned to capture it. Thanks, everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir.\nJud Henry: All right. Welcome to T-Mobile\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, welcome to the call, and as you can see, we are coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington at our headquarters and I am here gathered with a great group of our senior leadership team as we share with you some terrific results that we are posting today to kick off 2023. And I will start by saying our results for Q1 continue to demonstrate that no matter the competitive environment, our unique formula of offering the best network and the best value continues to produce best-in-class outcomes. We again led the industry in postpaid and broadband customer net adds, while continuing to deliver the best profitability growth. And our consistent focus on reliably translating customer growth into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth and unlocking substantial cash flow gives us the confidence to raise our full year guidance just one quarter into the new year. Now I will also say Q1 was a quarter of celebration at T-Mobile. I am so proud of how our now 10-year history of more than 20 Un-carrier moves have transformed to this wireless industry and more recently, broadband for the benefit of customers, and as you often hear us say, we won\u2019t stop. So we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those three-year contracts, while they are subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won\u2019t raise their price for top text and data. And now with new one too are part of Phone Freedom, they will be upgrade-ready in two years, because three years is too long to force customers to wait. Here\u2019s kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around, AT&T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter and yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon\u2019s or T-Mobile\u2019s customers. The lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we are here to solve it and that\u2019s what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That\u2019s what Phone Freedom is all about. And it\u2019s the way we have been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now. And as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the three-year anniversary of our merger. We are wrapping up an integration that many have deemed, and I think, we will conclude that it is, the most successful merger in telecom history. And most of all, we are celebrating what it was always about, the dream we had of leapfrogging from last place in the 4G era to leadership in the 5G era, smashing the biggest pain point of all by finally giving customers in this industry both, the best network and the best value from the same provider. And you know what? We did it and we did it ahead of schedule, meeting our commitments and unlocking massive value in the process. And yeah, we brought about a new level of competition to this market and a 5G network to America that would not have been possible without this merger and that makes customers and businesses everywhere, the real winners. Speaking of network, another round of results are in and our team is again celebrating wins as the largest, fastest and most awarded 5G network as well as the best overall network for the second quarter in a row according to Ookla. And this is not just a snapshot in time. It is a durable network lead. And I am confident that Ulf and team in his new role as President of Technology, congratulations and thank you for stepping in to lead us\u2026\nUlf Ewaldsson: Thank you. Mike Sievert \u2026 will continue to keep us ahead in this race over the next years with our great spectrum assets in both depth and breadth deployed rapidly and our rapid execution of our unique process called customer-driven coverage, and finally, continued leadership in implementing advanced technologies such as standalone 5G and multi-carrier aggregation. All of these things, importantly are contributing to the best capital efficiency in our sector. All of these strengths, coupled with our unique opportunity in underpenetrated markets are what enables a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition, and you know what, we showed that again in Q1. We added 287,000 postpaid account net additions, the highest reported in the industry once again. And that means we are winning the switching decisions in the market, because this looks at it at the account level. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.3 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. This included postpaid phone net adds of 538,000. We won a higher share of net adds year-over-year even as the industry continues to moderate, just like we predicted we would in previous calls. Our increased share was driven by our strong phone gross adds, as well as being the only national wireless provider to improve postpaid phone churn year-over-year. Our consistent approach to profitable growth continues to deliver right on and sometimes even above our ambitious plans and that\u2019s even as the competitive landscape continues to shift and evolve. In recent quarters, we have seen cable giving away three first lines that don\u2019t, by the way, appear to be incrementally pulling from existing customers and incumbent providers but definitely are driving their ARPUs down. We have seen AT&T and Verizon significantly outspend us in media advertising. I mean Verizon alone spent almost 60% more than T-Mobile in Q1. And we continue to see, as I mentioned earlier, others lean into expensive long-term device contract offers to lock up their customers, while T-Mobile was the only one who improve churn year-over-year and have the lowest upgrade rate. Improving churn, but with the lowest upgrades, that\u2019s because our approach is not to slam customers with expensive unwanted upgrade contracts to tie them down for three years. Customers genuinely choose to stay with T-Mobile for the network, for the value proposition and for the experiences. And you know what? That\u2019s how we want it to be. You have heard us say before, our strategy is differentiated and durable, because it\u2019s driven by taking share in the places where we continue to be underpenetrated relative to the market, but where we now have new permission to win. This profitable growth playbook and the momentum we saw in Q1 is exactly what gives us the confidence to raise our postpaid net add and financial guidance for the year. A perfect example of this, T-Mobile for Business where we just posted one of our highest ever phone net add quarter in Q1 with the lowest business phone churn in our history and we are profitably taking share with more business account net adds and more business phone net adds than Verizon in the quarter. On the consumer side, we are winning with prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs. In fact, our prime customer base hit an all-time high again this quarter. And in smaller markets and rural areas, we are now capturing a win share of switchers in the upper 30s and that\u2019s in the roughly two-thirds of this geography where we are competing. This is great news, because it\u2019s showing that our strategy here is very much on track. In addition, we added 523,000 high-speed Internet customers as we have continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched two years ago. I would expect that we added more broadband customers than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the fourth consecutive quarter. And not only did we have the highest net adds, but our focus on profitable growth translated into strong financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow up over 45%. Our Q1 results were just the latest example of how we have lots of room to run at T-Mobile and I am confident in our ambitions for this year and beyond. One thing you have come to expect from this management team is that we are never satisfied, and you saw that again with our latest Un-carrier move to free customers from three-year contracts and introduce new Go5G plans that offer even more value than before. As proud as I am of what we have accomplished in our 10 years as the Un-carrier and in Q1 most recently, I am even more excited about what\u2019s ahead for T-Mobile and I am so thankful that all of you are on this journey with us. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about the key financial highlights and our updated guidance for 2023.\nPeter Osvaldik: Absolutely. Thank you, Mike. 2023 is positioned to be another year of best-in-class profitable growth based on our Q1 results and the updated guidance I will share with you in a moment. Our continued increases in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 6% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in a 9% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points year-over-year, while AT&T and Verizon were flat to down. In addition, as Mike mentioned, free cash flow was up over 45% and unlock the highest free cash flow margin relative to our peers. We expect our industry-leading free cash flow margin to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 33 million shares for $4.8 billion in Q1, with a cumulative total of 59.4 million shares repurchased for $8.5 billion as of April 21. It was also great to see our continued execution on profitable growth reflected in the recent rating upgrades from both Moody\u2019s to Baa2 and Fitch who recently upgraded us two notches to BBB+. These rating increases further strengthen our access to lower cost capital in the deep investment grade market. All right. Let\u2019s jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid phone net customer additions -- total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.7 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectations, which are now expected to be between $28.8 million and $29.2 billion, this is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies, of course, excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million, as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be between $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching the full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the recently raised run rate synergy target of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and we also continue to expect cash merger-related costs of $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to-date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which includes payments for merger-related costs is now expected to be in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion, driven by a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. We expect Q2 to remain elevated, just slightly lower than Q1 and then moderating in the back half of the year. Together, this results in higher free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, which is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And as I mentioned, this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers and based on the cadence of CapEx, I would expect free cash flow in Q2 to be slightly higher than Q1 and then ramp in the back half of the year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023. All right. Before I wrap up, I want to give a quick update on the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent. The process is progressing very smoothly led by Dave and the team at Cogent, and we now expect the transaction to close in early May. On a quarterly basis, this will lead to approximately $125 million lower wholesale and other service revenue and approximately $175 million lower cost of service expenses with a nominal impact to SG&A. With the mid-quarter closing, we expect a partial impact in Q2 with the full quarter impact beginning in Q3. So, in closing, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud?\nJud Henry: Thanks, Peter. All right. [Operator Instructions] Operator, let\u2019s take our first question, please.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Maybe we can start with the revenue per user. I think you said the same thing about ARPA this quarter that you did last approximately up 1% in 2023. We have been looking at the Go5G plans, which were launched recently. Can you remind us of the path of customers moving to Magenta MAX, how long that took and sort of the and is that a good guide for the pace of the Go5G upgrades and how that drives that ARPA lift?\nMike Sievert: Hey, Phil. I will start and maybe turn to Mike and Peter. First of all, we are really excited about this new lineup. But I want to point out a couple of things. One, Magenta MAX continues to be in the lineup and so this is being added to Magenta MAX. And as we think about the price point represented by these kind of mainstream popular plans, we are going to be kind of thinking of it as Magenta MAX and higher. So that would include Magenta MAX, it would include the new Go5G Plus Plan kind of as a category. And what you see is, our expectation is that, that run rate we have been seeing in that 60s will carry forward and we have certainly seen that since the launch and it was true for Magenta MAX all through Q1. So really great to see that our popular plans are also our highest value plans packed with the things T-Mobile customers are looking for. And maybe, Mike, you can talk about -- unpack that a little bit.\nMike Katz: Yeah. I mean, I think like Mike said, it\u2019s a great representation of the differentiation of our strategy, particularly as it comes to the way that we construct rate plans and do pricing, because with Go5G and Go5G Plus, you see new plans that are incremental to our portfolio that really give customers choice. And with these plans, we packed in the most benefits that we have ever done in the plan with increased roaming in Mexico and Canada, which is the most popular destination for our customers, increased hotspot, which we are seeing utilized more, especially in a post-pandemic world where people are moving around and working everywhere and with Go5G Plus. The first plan, we are guaranteed in the plan, new and existing customers get the same deal on phones, not a promotion like you see from other folks. So we are really bullish on these plans. The early response to them has been really good. One of the things I will say about ARPU is ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And one of the things that you see with us, particularly with the success in some of the segments that we have talked about as being opportunities for us, whether it\u2019s business or 55-plus. The mix of our success in those segments is reflected in our ARPU and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we look a lot at ARPA and we focus a lot on opportunities where we can attract customers and retain customers that demonstrate a really high CLV, like we see with business customers and like we see with 55-plus customers. So you will see us continue to focus on those kinds of accretive value creating opportunities in our portfolio.\nMike Sievert: Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. I think the only thing I add and Mike said it really well is, it\u2019s such a mix-driven metric. And for example, on the segments that Mike spoke about 55-plus brings in customers with CLVs that are actually above the average CLV, right? They may have lower ARPUs but very high accretive CLVs, because that\u2019s how we really model everything and the growth that we are trying to drive, as you know, is profitable growth for us. So on an ARPU-based metric, because of that mix shift, I\u2019d probably expect it to be sequentially relatively flat. But, yes, as you pick up some more mix of potentially 5G Plus -- Go5G Plus, excuse me, 5G everywhere here, then you could see some opportunity in the latter half of the year. But ARPA and accounts is really where the focus is to create that value expansion in the company.\nPhil Cusick: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Simon.\nLandon Park: Hi. This is Landon on for Simon. Thanks for taking the question.\nMike Sievert: Okay.\nLandon Park: I am wondering if we could start on the home broadband side. Maybe can you talk about how you are seeing churn in the different cohorts there and what your latest thoughts are on some of the fiber trials you have been running, as well as the latest thoughts on a potential millimeter wave overlay on that front?\nMike Sievert: Yeah. I will start and then we will see who wants to jump in. There\u2019s a bunch there. First of all, you are asking about our fiber trials. And I don\u2019t have a lot new to report there, other than this is a team that, obviously, through our leadership in high-speed Internet and 5G is very committed to being winners in broadband. And so for us, being able to get involved, learn, understand what drives CLV, understand the service models, the technology models, et cetera, is something that\u2019s very important and you see us continuing to do that. We haven\u2019t taken any decisions beyond that other than anything we learn there is accretive to us being in this business and you see that we are already in this business as a major player in the 5G variant. As it relates to what we are seeing in the business itself, I am very pleased. I mean Net Promoter Scores for this business continue to be higher than average cable and higher-than-average fiber in the country. So people love what T-Mobile is serving up to them and that\u2019s important and it informs the churn models, as you are saying. Now we have a very young base and so to your point, we look at it on a cohorted view and some of those aging customers from earlier, we really like what we are seeing in terms of their retention. So really pleased and you can see Net Promoter Score as kind of an indicator of that. Mike, why don\u2019t you jump in, anything else you want to share on that?\nMike Katz: I would just say to Mike\u2019s point, as the customer base is growing as we are seeing more cohorts in the longer tenures, we are seeing sequential decreases in churn. And it really does start with what Mike said, this is a great product. It\u2019s a product that really that doesn\u2019t require any trade-offs from customers. It\u2019s got a great NPS and you are seeing it pull heavily from cable. Cable is the biggest contributor to our customer base in this business. And we have built a model and a go-to-market process that now is reliably delivering plus or minus 500,000 customers a quarter, which gives us a lot of confidence in this number that we talked about a couple of years ago of us getting to several millions at the end of this planning period.\nMike Sievert: Okay. And last part of your question was about where do we go beyond our current model and I want to remind everybody what the current model is before answering that, because it kind of speaks to the opportunity here, because others have side eye to what we are doing and said, well, you know there\u2019s a limited opportunity to that. What they are doing over there, and we are like, well, right. I mean we have said that all along. We expect this to be a 7 million unit to 8 million unit opportunity the way we are doing it right now, which is essentially selling excess capacity on our network. So remember, the way this works is, we have created a nationwide mapping of every household in this country, map them to every sector on every tower and determined which sectors no normal amount of mobile wireless use will take up our rapidly expanding capacity and that is where we approve applicants for high-speed Internet on 5G. So we are essentially selling our excess capacity. We see that, that takes us into those high single-digit millions of households in the planning period. Now the question that you asked about millimeter wave is really part of a broader question that says, whether for millimeter wave or not, would we entertain the idea of a capital burden to 5G home Internet plan. And yeah, we would entertain that. It would have to be smart. We would have to have a way to make it capital efficient. We haven\u2019t taken any decisions on that. I don\u2019t know if you want to share a little bit of our thinking or kind of what we see as the opportunity of, but the short answer of it is we haven\u2019t taken a decision on it, but of course, we are interested in it.\nNeville Ray: Well, thanks, Mike, and great question, Simon. And I would say that our 2.5 spectrum that we are using today is serving us so well, because we have so much excess capacity. We are moving now from 200 -- this quarter we are reporting 275 million POPs covered by with this mid-band spectrum and we are moving towards 300 coverage by the end of the year, giving us new opportunities also to serve other HSI opportunities. Then I would say that we are always looking at millimeter wave when we are doing trials and testing, but it\u2019s limited in reach and we have to remember that it\u2019s limited in reach and we will put it into an economic formula over time to see if it makes sense to pursue it.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. Thanks for joining the call.\nLandon Park: Thank you very much.\nMike Sievert: All right. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please proceed.\nMike Sievert: Hi, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Hey, Mike. Maybe a couple of questions. First just on the competitive environment. You mentioned Verizon has been a little bit sort of ladder from an advertising statement. I think from a promotion standpoint, too, and Comcast we had some success with their sort of free line offer similar what Charter has been doing. Just how would you characterize the competitive environment in wireless as it stands today and sort of what gives you the confidence to sort of raise the postpaid numbers as we look into the rest of the year? And then on the buyback, a bit higher than we thought and you are sort of pretty far along on the authorization, should we expect the buyback to slow through the year as you bump up against that existing authorization? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Great. So competition and buyback. I will start on competition and then turn to Jon Freier. I would say, it\u2019s competitive out there. And that being said, I have probably done 50 of these calls for T-Mobile and that\u2019s been the case for all 50 of them. It\u2019s competitive out there and we have made it more competitive through the creation of this version of T-Mobile. What I said in my prepared remarks is that we have demonstrated time and time again that regardless of the competitive mill, we find our way through to accretive profitable growth, and that\u2019s because our strategy is so differentiated. So I am not going to repeat all that here, other than to say, of course, it\u2019s really competitive. I find the industry a rational level of competition, even the competitors you talked about have been pulsing in and out. Some of the offers have been eyebrow raising but they pulse in and out. I think to me, it feels competitive and rational and we look at our differentiated strategy. And what we have within our control and we see our way through to increasing our overall guidance for the year. But maybe tell us on the ground, Jon, what your team is seeing as we compete last quarter and this quarter.\nJon Freier: Yeah. You bet. So, yeah, like Mike said, it is a competitive environment, but that\u2019s nothing really new for us and we are seeing -- continuing to see real solid demand out there. When you look at our overall traffic, when you look at the interest, we are seeing incredible demand that you can see, obviously manifested in our Q1 numbers. And even so far in Q2, we are seeing really strong demand and like we said earlier in our prepared comments, not only strong demand as a whole, but strong demand around prime customers and the fact that we had our highest mix of prime customers. We are continuing to see a very healthy activating revenue number in terms of new accounts switching to Magenta MAX and now Go5G Plus, and since we even launched that on Sunday, we are seeing really good numbers kind of an early peek into what\u2019s happening there. And then I would just tell you, too, from what\u2019s happening in the marketplace is, again, our differentiated position in what we are doing in smaller markets and rural areas. And one of the things that we talked to you about in 2021 at Analyst Days, we had this ambition to move from 13% share of households to 20% by the end of 2025. And what we are really excited about is that we are already halfway there. We are now at 16.5% in terms of our share in household position. So more than halfway there or halfway there, but in less than half the time over that planning horizon. And when you look at what we are doing relative to others, it\u2019s really coming down to four things in smaller markets, rural areas. One, is we are building out this -- the markets out there with network and distribution. We are now playing in two-thirds of smaller markets in real areas, 140 million people, 50 million households, 40% of the U.S. Two, we are really unlocking switching and getting switching moving. Last quarter, I told you that switching was up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis, we are sustaining that with now postpaids win share in the upper 30s. Three, is when you look at what\u2019s happening with high speed Internet, we talked about that just a few moments ago, but that\u2019s a new front door for us that gets, even before people are thinking about switching mobile, we can get into the household as a catalyst for customers to be thinking about moving their mobile services into T-Mobile from AT&T, Verizon, et cetera. And then lastly, what we have that\u2019s different in those particular markets is we have a dedicated and focused team where we are building out hundreds of stores about a little bit more than 400 stores since we have started this venture out in the smaller markets and rural areas. So when you look at what\u2019s happened under the ground, strong demand really getting after it in 40% of the U.S. from smaller markets and real areas and then when you look at the overall health and the quality of the customer that we are talking to, it\u2019s never been better.\nMike Sievert: So it\u2019s been two years and we have made our way halfway from 13% to 16.5% market share and we are only really competing in two-thirds of the space. It\u2019s just been this rapid fire deployment, and it\u2019s -- you should be so proud of what\u2019s happening there. Jon, at the risk of filibustering your competition question, I have one more thing. I feel like we shouldn\u2019t answer a question about competition unless we talk about cable.\nJon Freier: Right.\nMike Sievert: And we are a very competitive company, so one thing I will give our team a little bit of credit on is that, we have pretty good diagnostics and telemetry on what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and so we are able to kind of see what happens with each of the competitors as the quarter unfolds and I can make a couple of predictions for you. You saw it in Comcast numbers this morning, very strong. Charter had a blockbuster quarter, we think, in phone net additions and we saw that unfolding through the quarter. But one of the things we try to do when we sort of make out -- at least for us, when we make our operating decisions is we try to figure out, well, what\u2019s behind it and double click into it. And what we see going on is that, for example, in this big number, they are about to report, about 75%, we think, of the uptick from prior normal levels, let\u2019s say, a year ago, are in non-parts sort of printed net adds, like drop you a free line in the bag or kind of low calorie net adds. And so we try to kind of adjust for that when we make our operating decisions as to how fast to run and where and how to compete, because they are really -- it\u2019s kind of a quantitative easing happening in the marketplace. There\u2019s just new adds being printed that don\u2019t appear to be coming from any of the incumbent players. So it\u2019s kind of important to adjust for all that, at least for us, as we make our operating decisions. It looks to us about 75% of the uptick has been those kinds of nets. So you actually asked two questions, yeah, your second question was about the buyback.\nJohn Hodulik: Right.\nMike Sievert: And let me say a couple of things and I will turn it over to Peter. Like, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into how fast we are going and I cannot make any predictions for you as to how that will play out in the future. I could just tell you that generally speaking, we are going fast because we think we are getting a relative great deal on the stock and it\u2019s not normal for management to talk a lot about valuation. But since you have hired us to conduct this buyback on your behalf, we have to make operating decisions with an idea in mind about whether or not we are getting a relative value. And our team thinks and our Board thinks it is and so we have authorized moving quickly, because we look at this rapidly developing cash flow picture and a lot of people are increasingly valuing T-Mobile on our value relative to cash production and we see a lot of potential ahead for a diminishing opportunity for us to be able to grab shares at these share prices and so we are moving really fast. I cannot predict for you, though, what that means going forward, obviously, we are going to take it one step at a time.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. The only thing I\u2019d add, Mike, is, of course, we -- I am personally very excited about how it\u2019s gone and while we can\u2019t speak about anything more than the $14 billion target, that\u2019s been approved by the Board, remember, what allows all of that is the cash flow generation of this business, as you have mentioned. And frankly, both with regards to the longer term and the underpinning of that opportunity for up to $60 billion in share buybacks through just the end of 2025 and here we are in 2023 already. Remember, this machine and this free cash flow production continues into 2026 and beyond. But the one thing I look at is that is the underpinnings that allows the shareholder return machine to go and you just saw us once again raise what was already ambitious guidance for the year based on our confidence just a quarter in. So in that regard and how the share buybacks are progressing, I am very pleased.\nMike Sievert: Okay. We better keep moving. We gave you quite an answer there, John.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Operator, next question? You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please proceed.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Jonathan.\nJonathan Chaplin: Hey, guys. I am going to ask two questions as well, if that\u2019s okay. The color you just gave us on small markets, some of the progress you are making on market share is super helpful. I am wondering if you can give us exactly the same context for business in terms of where you are in share and any color you can give us around sort of the number of business accounts or business lines you have would be super helpful? And then on the Phone Freedom Plan which looks like it really has the potential to unlock trapped customers, as you suggest. Can you help us understand what the impact of that is on EBITDA expectations for the rest of the year? You have got, on the positive side, obviously, you are pushing people into higher ARPU plans. But then presumably to trigger a higher upgrade rate and so that\u2019s a cost against it and how do those two things net together in the guidance?\nMike Sievert: Okay. Sounds great. Well, let\u2019s go first to Callie. I will just say she\u2019s going to give you exactly what you asked for, which is some color on what\u2019s going on, but probably not what was behind what you asked for, which is lots of racking and stacking of market share numbers and things like that. We are moving really fast here and we want to keep it competitive as to some of the details. But maybe tell us what you are seeing in the marketplace?\nCallie Field: Yeah. Thanks, Mike, and thanks, John, for the question. You know we have a longstanding goal to be the growth leader in business and I am really pleased to see that we are making very nice progress towards doubling our market share. We are growing in customers and in revenue. And we are taking share from AT&T and Verizon. In fact, in Q1, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our business account growth, our phone net adds and our phone churn were all better than Verizon. And while AT&T reported declines in FirstNet quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 2.5 times growth in Connecting Heroes. So we are winning and we are winning across every segment. In Enterprise, we were selected to be the exclusive partner nationwide for AAA to develop roadside connectivity using partners like Dialpad with a collaboration tool and in our phone solutions. Siemens Energy selected T-Mobile their exclusive partner, UPS, Oracle, Dell Resorts. These are all companies that are choosing T-Mobile, because of the quality, the value and the performance of our network. In the government space, I will add, I am actually really proud of the team for the work that we have been doing with Veteran Affairs. The VA just selected T-Mobile as a primary partner for nine years with over 50,000 phone lines, as well as to create health care 5G solutions in the vertical. So we are very excited about that. In SMB, what I can say in SMB is that, we have seen net positive port trends versus Verizon for four quarters straight in a row. So it\u2019s great profitable rates, great CLVs, competing not only like I said, on the best value, but also a superior product and experience. You know businesses buy because they have tested the product and we surpassed the competition.\nMike Sievert: It could be a little bit of a canary in the coal mine for us, too, because of that fact, that last fact that you just shared, Callie, that businesses aren\u2019t going so much on brand reputation. They actually check out the phones, like sometimes hundreds of them before making these decisions and compare us head-to-head. And so businesses through their testing now that we now have the best network and we do get questions about, well, how are you going to keep competing if the incumbent guys just keeps slashing their prices to hang on to those customers. And what is missed in that dialogue is that that\u2019s not actually the only factor going into this decision process.\nCallie Field: Yeah.\nMike Sievert: I mean businesses have corporate liable lines for a reason. They want to take responsibility for this connection, because it\u2019s mission-critical and we can save them some money. I mean we are the Un-carrier, but they are picking us because we are the best network. And that\u2019s been a breakthrough that I would say was not the case the same way a couple of years ago. So you are hearing a lot of optimism there. One thing we did here as we listened in, were some in the industry is kind of saying, hey, there\u2019s a sort of a sector decline happening, lots of layoffs, companies aren\u2019t interested in business lines anymore, there\u2019s sort of a pause going on. That is not our experience and you can hear that in the optimism of what Callie is saying. Okay, your second question was about Phone Freedom and what\u2019s going on there. So maybe we will start with Mike and then there was a particular EBITDA outlook question associated with Peter.\nMike Katz: Yeah. Like I mentioned before, Phone Freedom kind of had two big components to it. One was the rate plan Go5G, Go5G Plus, which, Jonathan, as you indicated, has this benefit of upgrade built into it. And then the second thing, which I think is also an important input to the second part of the question you asked is, we launched a promotional program called the Easy Unlock. And what the Easy Unlock, the insight it\u2019s really going off of is both what Mike talked about in terms of the dissatisfaction that AT&T customers have, 50% more reports that they want to leave their current carrier than in Verizon and T-Mobile. And when they want to leave, it\u2019s incredibly difficult, both because of long-term contracts, but also because they have the most customer unfriendly unlock process in the entire industry. And what we wanted to do is make switching incredibly easy and that\u2019s what we did with that program. And I think that\u2019s one of the things that will really help us unlock the switcher pool a little bit, which when we know happens, T-Mobile is the disproportionate winner.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. And with regards, Jonathan, to the EBITDA guidance, I mean, frankly, even at year end, we had already assumed a certain level of opportunity here. Customers were clearly telling us, especially through the back half of last year that they are looking for what this best value, best network combination can provide in the form of Magenta MAX at the time. And so that was an inspiration that we said we were going to pack an even more fully featured plan out there. So I\u2019d say all of the revenue assumptions around this, as well as customer acquisition leading to high CLVs is all packed into core EBITDA, the guide that we provided to you. I know there was also a question on social around -- well, how does that impact the contract asset, and frankly, to say that was -- the contract asset went up sequentially from Q4, but that was really some of the promotions that we had in place and continued into Q1, as well as some of the business promotions. But in the current core EBITDA guidance that we put out there, there\u2019s an assumption actually that the contract asset will decrease to quite an immaterial net impact for the year, and again, in the current guide that we gave.\nMike Sievert: Good stuff. Okay.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMike Sievert: How do we go over to the ones coming in on Twitter. So all get ready, there\u2019s -- you are always popular and your topic is always popular online. Let\u2019s see. I will go to Bill Ho [ph], I want to talk about the network. And this is really about -- he\u2019s giving some stats here, but I think the question is really about, can you tell us about depth and breadth. So we have 275 million people covered by ultra-capacity 5G mid-band and we are going to 300 million. How easy or hard is it in these last 25 million or how easy or hard is it in the last 100 million and that\u2019s kind of interesting if you compare to where the competitors are right now and what\u2019s still ahead of them. But then in that, can you also talk about the depth, how much spectrum is where we are going?\nUlf Ewaldsson: Right. I mean if we start with the breadth, we continue to build out and we are now reporting the 275 million as you catch here and we are -- have about 25 million to go. We are very confident that we are going to reach the 300 million by the end of the year. It gets harder and harder. And as a rule of thumb, I would say that, it\u2019s about 3 times harder for every 10 million that you add. So that\u2019s about how hard it gets. And the reason is, of course, the geography of the U.S., where it\u2019s a very vast geography with a very high population density in some communities. So it\u2019s very easy when you start out and it gets harder and harder to do it. But we are very confident that we are going to reach that with the build plan that we have today. When it comes to the depth of the network, it\u2019s just amazing how we continue to just move more and more frequency assets over from LTE to 5G. We today have 150 megahertz dedicated on our mid-band, which is giving us tremendous speeds. We have increased our speed advantage on the downlink speeds compared to competition in this last quarter and we are actually going to end up the year with 200 megahertz of dedicated spectrum just on the mid-band. So it\u2019s just fantastic to see that journey moving forward with our tech team.\nMike Sievert: Which means with each passing day, the overall capacity of this network is rapidly expanding. It\u2019s a fascinating thing when you listen to what Ulf says too, about how the easy part is that first 100-and-something million POPs, right, which generally corresponds to where our competitors are. And so we get questions a lot about, hey, you guys jumped out with a couple of year lead in 5G, aren\u2019t they catching you. And hopefully, you can understand when you see where we already are and where we are at the end of the year. Now there\u2019s still years behind us because that last part is really difficult and it\u2019s really important for the overall perception that a customer has about the brand. You have to be great outside the core urbans with a high capacity offering for somebody to believe you have a high capacity offering. And that matters to them even if they don\u2019t leave that space all the time. So it\u2019s really important, and it\u2019s one of the many reasons why we have a durable leap. Okay. Should we go back to the calls? Let\u2019s do it. Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question.\nMike Sievert: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Feldman: Hi, Mike. So you made an interesting observation when you were talking about churn. You pointed out that you had the best year-on-year improvement in churn, but you also noted that you don\u2019t yet have the lowest churn in this category. And that\u2019s interesting because you also noted that you have very large cohorts in your customer base and as a group exhibit a lower churn profile than comparable cohorts at your peers. So it certainly seems like there\u2019s an opportunity to keep driving churn down across the base. So when you look at the pockets of your customers where the churn profile is still elevated, why is that -- how do you think about how much of an opportunity that is and is it actually part of your underlying business plan to continue driving churn lower or do you think you have hit some sort of plateau? Thanks.\nMike Katz: Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Listen, I think, we are at a fascinating sort of historical moment in the history of our company. If you think about it, we have spent six years on the chapter of our company comprised of dreaming about and then completing and then integrating the merger that would allow us to leapfrog AT&T and Verizon from being last place in the LTE era to first place in the 5G era. And now we have generally gotten that done, we have the best network in the country, we have the best values and we have generally completed that merger. And so now we have work to do to convince the American public that it\u2019s true. And to me, I am inspired a little bit by the journey of standalone T-Mobile that did achieve the lowest churn rates in the industry, even without the advantages of the network strength. And so now you see us really focused on prime customers. We have the highest prime rate in the history of our company right now. You see us focusing on business customers. You see us focusing on travelers, some of the best customers in the industry now waking up more and more to the fact that T-Mobile is the best choice for them and that\u2019s a journey, convincing the country that what\u2019s true is true, will take some time. But let me tell you this, our goal -- the answer to your question is, yes, our goal is to have the lowest churn in the industry on postpaid phones. And we already have it on prepaid, we are going to have it on postpaid phones. Of course, we should. I mean we have the best network and the best prices. That means we should have the lowest churn. And so we have been through this worst to first journey before we standalone T-Mobile. We are kind of midway through it with the new version of the company and full of optimism about where it can finally land. Those big sort of quarter-by-quarter kind of merger-driven lurches forward are mostly behind us, right, because the integration is behind us. So now it\u2019s that hard slog just like we showed you we could do when we were standalone T-Mobile.\nBrett Feldman: Okay. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. You bet. Great. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. Please proceed.\nMike Sievert: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good afternoon. Hi. Two questions. First, going back to the customer unlock opportunities, where is the industry and T-Mobile on eSIM capabilities and is this a topic that\u2019s important to helping you propel unlocks and switching opportunities? And then just secondly, do you have visibility on whether or not DISH will exercise its option to buy your 800 megahertz spectrum, and if they don\u2019t, what is the next steps for T-Mobile with respect to that spectrum band?\nMike Sievert: Great. I will start with the DISH one and then give Mike a chance to think up and answer on the eSIM one. The -- no, we don\u2019t have visibility into it yet. DISH asked for an extension in the decision. We didn\u2019t object to that of about 60 days. And the way our consent decree works is it\u2019s entirely up to them. We are here to support them and so we will wait to hear what they decide. I am in touch with Charlie. So as I learn more, we may engage and be able to be helpful in that. But it\u2019s -- the way it works is it\u2019s entirely up to them and so if they want the spectrum under the terms of the consent decree, it\u2019s theirs. And if not, the way it works is that it would go to auction and it would maybe be in the hands of someone else. And so we will wait and see how it all unfolds and we are here to support whatever decision that they make. On eSIM, this is fascinating how this has all happened across the industry and there hasn\u2019t been that much discussion about it. One of the limiters has been this phone locking phenomenon that we are talking about with Phone Freedom. Because what happens with an eSIM is on a locked phone, even though that second SIM is available, if the phone is locked, you still can\u2019t use that second SIM very easily and so there\u2019s been some barriers to the friction coming out of the system, the way eSIM may be promised. But we are big fans of it. You saw us a few months ago, introduced great switching capabilities for you to actually try our network on the second SIM if your phone allows that. That\u2019s been a lot of fun for people to be able to test drive our network. But, Mike, maybe you can give some color on what we are seeing.\nMike Katz: Yeah. I was going to say something really similar. We are big fans of eSIM, really for two big reasons. One, we think it\u2019s a much better customer experience. You don\u2019t have to deal with plastic and switching in and out of your phones every couple of years when people are upgrading. And for a company that wins when switching happens, eSIM does make switching easier and we have tried to take advantage of that with the technology that Mike mentioned earlier, where we launched an app where you can easily test the T-Mobile network side-by-side with your incumbent network on the same phone and when you are ready to switch, you can just do it in a couple of clicks. So we are fans of eSIM. We are really supportive of it, and we are optimistic that it will help accelerate even programs that we talked about today with that Phone Freedom.\nMike Sievert: Okay. How about\u2026\nMichael Rollins: Just real quick\u2026\nMike Sievert: \u2026 twitter, Roger Adler [ph] want to talk about T-Mobile for Business. I think we hit most of that, unless you want to provide any color on what we are seeing with HSI in T-Mobile for Business. And then a separate question about, with our new Go5G plans, they are raised prices, do we think that will impact our subscriber growth. And I am glad you asked that, because, no. And in fact, the way we kind of did this is we added these plans and that won\u2019t be immediately obvious to everybody, but we added them. So if you present at retailer online, you can still get Magenta and Magenta MAX. But these new plans in the early days, now that we have put them out there, they are really turning out to be very popular and so I am not worried -- even notwithstanding the fact that they are being added, I am not worried at all. These are going to be really popular plans, because we design them right to the needs that we are hearing customers want in the marketplace. And this is really an interesting thing, because we called it Go5G for a reason. Our 5G customers are using massive amounts of data on our network. And people say, what\u2019s the killer app of 5G. There are a lot of killer apps of 5G, but one of them is usage on your smartphone, which if you have T-Mobile and Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, you have massive connectivity and customers are soaking it up and that\u2019s a real differentiator for us. And so we want to play into that advantage and encourage that kind of usage, because once they see what their phone can do, they are not going to want to live without it. We are already seeing that now at scale with millions of customers at Magenta MAX or above. Okay. So let\u2019s go back to the phone, Jud.\nJud Henry: Let\u2019s do it.\nMike Sievert: Operator, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nCraig Moffett: Yeah. Hi. Two questions, if I could. One is I want to stay with the DISH theme for a minute. It\u2019s becoming more and more openly discussed that DISH may eventually be a liquidation story. If that were to happen and if the FCC were willing, how much appetite do you have for more spectrum? And it sort of leads into my second question, which is just with respect to 5G, the new applications have been somewhat slower to develop than might have been expected. I wonder if you could just update us on 5G usage growth and how quickly the consumption of network resources is proceeding with 5G and if that is the differentiator you had hoped and expected it to be given your spectrum and network advantage?\nMike Sievert: Yeah. Look, on the first one and I will turn to Mike for the second one. On the first one, Craig, I am not going to answer it, because my friend, John think he kind of did answer it and I think he was very unfairly misquoted. He gave an innocent answer to a hypothetical kind of along the lines of any time there\u2019s spectrum, of course, we are interested and there are all kinds of headlines whether he wants to buy a DISH of the spectrum. Listen, first of all, I will say, I think, it\u2019s a little premature question too. I don\u2019t count DISH or Charlie out very easily. I have known him for a long time. So I think it\u2019s a premature question. But then finally, it raises a larger issue. And if you reframe it this way, which is, does this wireless industry have enough spectrum over the long haul for American competitiveness. I\u2019d say never, always there\u2019s an opportunity for more and that speaks to public policy. The FCC lost its auction authority this year and T-Mobile and others have been urging Congress to restore that, because we need our strong regulatory body to be able to work with other agencies, create an ongoing long-term pipeline of spectrum for all the players in this industry so that we can continue to have connectivity in this country that\u2019s the best in the world. And I know the FCC feels that way. I presume my competitors feel that way. But I think it\u2019s very important that we get back on track with this and that actions that are completed get put to use for the American consumer, because there\u2019s work that\u2019s pending there and that the FCC regains its authority quickly to be able to lead in this space going forward, the way they have done so well in the past. And I think that\u2019s very important for our company, for our competitors, but also for American competitiveness. Your second question is about apps in 5G. 5G -- it was sort of -- it kind of came out and I will say our competitor\u2019s kind of led the way on this with a lot of hype and euphoria around 20 gigabit connectivity in millimeter wave and it\u2019s going to change the world and we are all going to be kind of human cyborgs and stuff like that. And we kind of never felt that way. I mean early on, we went right to 5G is a much better, like 10 times better at least 4G and that the killer apps are going to be smartphones at first and they are going to be our ability to get after home broadband. And we focused on the mid-band asset and eventually the rest of the industry followed. We were right. And the average T-Mobile customer is getting 10 times the connectivity that they got in 2018, 10 times faster. That\u2019s amazing. And so what they are doing with it is amazing and so that obviously is unfolding. But there\u2019s still the kind of side eye questions people get, which is where is all this augmented reality you said would come? And I\u2019d say, well, first of all, our job is to create a great network and we have the best in the country. And as hardware and software developers look to a network to create innovations around, I think, they will choose T-Mobile. Whether they are moving faster or slower than predicted, doesn\u2019t directly affect our business that much. We need to be the network that they choose as they get inspired with massive connectivity, not just in fits and starts and parts of the country, but all across this country the way T-Mobile can uniquely provide and that\u2019s why we work with developers the way we do. But the rate and pace they go, that\u2019s up to them. Anything to add?\nMike Katz: The only other thing I\u2019d add is that, let\u2019s not forget about HIS, because HSI, I do think is still one of the big killer apps for 5G that you are seeing play out right now. 3.2 million customers running their home Internet in their house over our 5G wireless network and using hundreds of gigs a month on average, both in the big top 100 markets. But also importantly, many customers in rural areas, some of which this is the first high-speed option that existed and it only happened because of 5G. So I don\u2019t think we can forget about HSI being one of those big killer 5G applications.\nMike Sievert: Terrific. That\u2019s right.\nCraig Moffett: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nJud Henry: All right. Operator, we have got time for one more question.\nMike Sievert: Oh! It\u2019s the last one already. We are just getting warmed up.\nOperator: All right. Great. Our next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nDavid Barden: Thanks so much guys. Yeah. Hey, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. I am glad you are warm. The -- I guess the first question would be with the stock. The performance of the business has been great and the stock kind of just keeps bumping up against this 150 level. And I want to come back to this notion of the SoftBank top-up shares 48.8 million. Has there been any evolution in your thinking or conversations between yourselves and DT and SoftBank about using the remaining buyback authorization to simply clean that whole exercise up? It seems like it would be the most elegant and non-disruptive way to do it, and I\u2019d love your comments on that? And then the second question is and I kind of know what your answer is, but I just kind of want to hear how you frame it, which is that you originally for most of the states, not every state, pledge that you would not raise prices in T-Mobile for three years and that expired in April 1, 2023, and then you came out with your new Un-carrier plan. But it\u2019s within your toolkit now to be able to raise prices if inflation or other things happened, could you kind of give us a sense as to how you think about that relative to kind of T-Mobile\u2019s brand positioning in the market? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yeah. Sure. We maintain and have for the entire decade long journey of the Un-carrier an envelope of superior pricing versus our benchmark competitors and we intend for that to continue. Now as things shift and move, we maintain that envelope and it\u2019s not a matter of sort of a static price or being dogmatic about price has always got to be static, but we always want to be a relative value. And we can do that sustainably because we have a great balance sheet, we have the right capital structure, we have the right spectrum structure and other advantages that allow us to continue to profitably have a pricing envelope superiority versus our benchmark competitors. But as things move in the market with inflation or otherwise, of course, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to move along with those things. But we have the customers are North Star and our brand value proposition to take care of. That\u2019s why you have seen us so focused on offering higher value offers that customers self-select up to and it really shows their love for our brand that when we put something out there like Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, they flock to it. They -- our customers are buying up our rate card voluntarily in an era of inflation, because they appreciate the value of what we are putting in front of them. That speaks a lot about the brand and about the covenant between us and our customers on this brand. Okay, your first question was about the SoftBank true-up shares. And just to kind of remind everybody, there is this 48 million some shares that would trigger upon $150 stock price being at an average 45-day VWAP. And the short answer to your question is, of course, I mean, of course, we talk to them. They are a close partner of ours. We talk to DT all the time. We are aware of this question and this issue. But we have nothing to report. And so -- but I mean it\u2019s of interest, and it\u2019s not lost on us why you are asking the question. If there ever was to be a transaction, it has to be something that would work for everyone. I will say this, and the earlier question about our buyback pace, we have already bought back more shares than this potential dilution event and we intend to buy back a lot more shares going forward, should our capital program continue to support that as we have outlook it would. And so this is actually a fairly small potential event in the grand scheme of the shareholder remuneration that our cash flow production supports. And so anyway, with that, anything to add to that?\nPeter Osvaldik: No. Great.\nMike Sievert: Perfectly said. Anything to add to the whole show?\nPeter Osvaldik: The show must go on.\nMike Sievert: All right. Well, we appreciate you guys. Thanks for tuning in and for asking all these questions. I am so proud of our team. It\u2019s a fascinating year. It was fascinating for us to watch how it all started and the different perceptions people have. But one thing I hope that you take away from us is that, we are a team maniacally focused on delivering for you what we promised you we would do and that\u2019s what we show up and try to do every single time and I am so proud that this was one more quarter where we were able to put down great results and outlook for you in 2023 that we are going to be proud of. So thanks for tuning everybody. See you later.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile first quarter earnings call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a pleasant day everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Katz",
            "content": "Yeah. I mean, I think like Mike said, it's a great representation of the differentiation of our strategy, particularly as it comes to the way that we construct rate plans and do pricing, because with Go5G and Go5G Plus, you see new plans that are incremental to our portfolio that really give customers choice. And with these plans, we packed in the most benefits that we have ever done in the plan with increased roaming in Mexico and Canada, which is the most popular destination for our customers, increased hotspot, which we are seeing utilized more, especially in a post-pandemic world where people are moving around and working everywhere and with Go5G Plus. The first plan, we are guaranteed in the plan, new and existing customers get the same deal on phones, not a promotion like you see from other folks. So we are really bullish on these plans. The early response to them has been really good. One of the things I will say about ARPU is ARPU is a mix-driven metric. And one of the things that you see with us, particularly with the success in some of the segments that we have talked about as being opportunities for us, whether it's business or 55-plus. The mix of our success in those segments is reflected in our ARPU and it's one of the reasons why we look a lot at ARPA and we focus a lot on opportunities where we can attract customers and retain customers that demonstrate a really high CLV, like we see with business customers and like we see with 55-plus customers. So you will see us continue to focus on those kinds of accretive value creating opportunities in our portfolio. I would just say to Mike's point, as the customer base is growing as we are seeing more cohorts in the longer tenures, we are seeing sequential decreases in churn. And it really does start with what Mike said, this is a great product. It's a product that really that doesn't require any trade-offs from customers. It's got a great NPS and you are seeing it pull heavily from cable. Cable is the biggest contributor to our customer base in this business. And we have built a model and a go-to-market process that now is reliably delivering plus or minus 500,000 customers a quarter, which gives us a lot of confidence in this number that we talked about a couple of years ago of us getting to several millions at the end of this planning period. Yeah. Like I mentioned before, Phone Freedom kind of had two big components to it. One was the rate plan Go5G, Go5G Plus, which, Jonathan, as you indicated, has this benefit of upgrade built into it. And then the second thing, which I think is also an important input to the second part of the question you asked is, we launched a promotional program called the Easy Unlock. And what the Easy Unlock, the insight it's really going off of is both what Mike talked about in terms of the dissatisfaction that AT&T customers have, 50% more reports that they want to leave their current carrier than in Verizon and T-Mobile. And when they want to leave, it's incredibly difficult, both because of long-term contracts, but also because they have the most customer unfriendly unlock process in the entire industry. And what we wanted to do is make switching incredibly easy and that's what we did with that program. And I think that's one of the things that will really help us unlock the switcher pool a little bit, which when we know happens, T-Mobile is the disproportionate winner. Yeah. Thanks, Brett. Listen, I think, we are at a fascinating sort of historical moment in the history of our company. If you think about it, we have spent six years on the chapter of our company comprised of dreaming about and then completing and then integrating the merger that would allow us to leapfrog AT&T and Verizon from being last place in the LTE era to first place in the 5G era.

And so now you see us really focused on prime customers. We have the highest prime rate in the history of our company right now. You see us focusing on business customers. You see us focusing on travelers, some of the best customers in the industry now waking up more and more to the fact that T-Mobile is the best choice for them and that's a journey, convincing the country that what's true is true, will take some time. But let me tell you this, our goal -- the answer to your question is, yes, our goal is to have the lowest churn in the industry on postpaid phones. And we already have it on prepaid, we are going to have it on postpaid phones. Of course, we should. I mean we have the best network and the best prices. That means we should have the lowest churn. And so we have been through this worst to first journey before we standalone T-Mobile. We are kind of midway through it with the new version of the company and full of optimism about where it can finally land. Those big sort of quarter-by-quarter kind of merger-driven lurches forward are mostly behind us, right, because the integration is behind us. So now it's that hard slog just like we showed you we could do when we were standalone T-Mobile. Yeah. I was going to say something really similar.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Absolutely. Thank you, Mike. 2023 is positioned to be another year of best-in-class profitable growth based on our Q1 results and the updated guidance I will share with you in a moment. Our continued increases in postpaid accounts and postpaid ARPA resulted in the best postpaid service revenue growth in the industry, up 6% year-over-year. Our disciplined focus on profitability resulted in a 9% year-over-year increase in core adjusted EBITDA and we grew our core adjusted EBITDA margin by 270 basis points year-over-year, while AT&T and Verizon were flat to down. In addition, as Mike mentioned, free cash flow was up over 45% and unlock the highest free cash flow margin relative to our peers. We expect our industry-leading free cash flow margin to be a durable and differentiated unlock of shareholder value going forward. This strong financial performance also supported our share buybacks as we repurchased 33 million shares for $4.8 billion in Q1, with a cumulative total of 59.4 million shares repurchased for $8.5 billion as of April 21. It was also great to see our continued execution on profitable growth reflected in the recent rating upgrades from both Moody's to Baa2 and Fitch who recently upgraded us two notches to BBB+. These rating increases further strengthen our access to lower cost capital in the deep investment grade market. All right. Let's jump into the details of our increased guidance for 2023. We now expect total postpaid phone net customer additions -- total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.3 million and 5.7 million, up 250,000 at the midpoint, reflecting growth across all of our market opportunities and we continue to expect nearly half of postpaid net adds coming from phones for the full year. Our focus on profitable growth allows us to fund those higher customer net adds and still increase our core adjusted EBITDA expectations, which are now expected to be between $28.8 million and $29.2 billion, this is up 10% year-over-year at the midpoint based on higher service revenues and merger synergies, of course, excludes leasing revenues of approximately $300 million, as we transition substantially all remaining customers off device leasing by year end. Our merger synergies are expected to be between $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion in 2023, approaching the full run rate synergy target from our Analyst Day a year ahead of schedule as we build towards the recently raised run rate synergy target of $8 billion in 2024. We continue to expect merger-related costs, which are not included in adjusted or core adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $1 billion before taxes and we also continue to expect cash merger-related costs of $1.5 billion to $2 billion for 2023 as they have underrun the P&L recognition to-date. Net cash provided by operating activities, which includes payments for merger-related costs is now expected to be in the range of $17.9 billion to $18.3 billion. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $9.4 billion and $9.7 billion, driven by a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. We expect Q2 to remain elevated, just slightly lower than Q1 and then moderating in the back half of the year. Together, this results in higher free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, which is now expected to be in the range of $13.2 billion to $13.6 billion. This is up approximately 75% over last year. Thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. And as I mentioned, this also represents a free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers and based on the cadence of CapEx, I would expect free cash flow in Q2 to be slightly higher than Q1 and then ramp in the back half of the year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. And finally, as we execute our strategy of winning and expanding account relationships, we continue to expect full year postpaid ARPA to be up approximately 1% in 2023. All right. Before I wrap up, I want to give a quick update on the sale of our wireline assets to Cogent. The process is progressing very smoothly led by Dave and the team at Cogent, and we now expect the transaction to close in early May. On a quarterly basis, this will lead to approximately $125 million lower wholesale and other service revenue and approximately $175 million lower cost of service expenses with a nominal impact to SG&A. With the mid-quarter closing, we expect a partial impact in Q2 with the full quarter impact beginning in Q3. So, in closing, we expect 2023 to be another year of profitable growth and even greater free cash flow expansion as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our differentiated profitable growth opportunities. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Jud to begin the Q&A. Jud? Yeah. I think the only thing I add and Mike said it really well is, it's such a mix-driven metric. And for example, on the segments that Mike spoke about 55-plus brings in customers with CLVs that are actually above the average CLV, right? They may have lower ARPUs but very high accretive CLVs, because that's how we really model everything and the growth that we are trying to drive, as you know, is profitable growth for us. So on an ARPU-based metric, because of that mix shift, I'd probably expect it to be sequentially relatively flat. But, yes, as you pick up some more mix of potentially 5G Plus -- Go5G Plus, excuse me, 5G everywhere here, then you could see some opportunity in the latter half of the year. But ARPA and accounts is really where the focus is to create that value expansion in the company. Yeah. The only thing I'd add, Mike, is, of course, we -- I am personally very excited about how it's gone and while we can't speak about anything more than the $14 billion target, that's been approved by the Board, remember, what allows all of that is the cash flow generation of this business, as you have mentioned. And frankly, both with regards to the longer term and the underpinning of that opportunity for up to $60 billion in share buybacks through just the end of 2025 and here we are in 2023 already. Remember, this machine and this free cash flow production continues into 2026 and beyond. But the one thing I look at is that is the underpinnings that allows the shareholder return machine to go and you just saw us once again raise what was already ambitious guidance for the year based on our confidence just a quarter in. So in that regard and how the share buybacks are progressing, I am very pleased. Yeah. And with regards, Jonathan, to the EBITDA guidance, I mean, frankly, even at year end, we had already assumed a certain level of opportunity here. Customers were clearly telling us, especially through the back half of last year that they are looking for what this best value, best network combination can provide in the form of Magenta MAX at the time. And so that was an inspiration that we said we were going to pack an even more fully featured plan out there. So I'd say all of the revenue assumptions around this, as well as customer acquisition leading to high CLVs is all packed into core EBITDA, the guide that we provided to you. I know there was also a question on social around -- well, how does that impact the contract asset, and frankly, to say that was -- the contract asset went up sequentially from Q4, but that was really some of the promotions that we had in place and continued into Q1, as well as some of the business promotions. But in the current core EBITDA guidance that we put out there, there's an assumption actually that the contract asset will decrease to quite an immaterial net impact for the year, and again, in the current guide that we gave. No. Great. The show must go on."

            "content": "Yeah. You bet. So, yeah, like Mike said, it is a competitive environment, but that's nothing really new for us and we are seeing -- continuing to see real solid demand out there. When you look at our overall traffic, when you look at the interest, we are seeing incredible demand that you can see, obviously manifested in our Q1 numbers. And even so far in Q2, we are seeing really strong demand and like we said earlier in our prepared comments, not only strong demand as a whole, but strong demand around prime customers and the fact that we had our highest mix of prime customers. We are continuing to see a very healthy activating revenue number in terms of new accounts switching to Magenta MAX and now Go5G Plus, and since we even launched that on Sunday, we are seeing really good numbers kind of an early peek into what's happening there. And then I would just tell you, too, from what's happening in the marketplace is, again, our differentiated position in what we are doing in smaller markets and rural areas. And one of the things that we talked to you about in 2021 at Analyst Days, we had this ambition to move from 13% share of households to 20% by the end of 2025. And what we are really excited about is that we are already halfway there. We are now at 16.5% in terms of our share in household position. So more than halfway there or halfway there, but in less than half the time over that planning horizon. And when you look at what we are doing relative to others, it's really coming down to four things in smaller markets, rural areas. One, is we are building out this -- the markets out there with network and distribution. We are now playing in two-thirds of smaller markets in real areas, 140 million people, 50 million households, 40% of the U.S. Two, we are really unlocking switching and getting switching moving. Last quarter, I told you that switching was up 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis, we are sustaining that with now postpaids win share in the upper 30s. Three, is when you look at what's happening with high speed Internet, we talked about that just a few moments ago, but that's a new front door for us that gets, even before people are thinking about switching mobile, we can get into the household as a catalyst for customers to be thinking about moving their mobile services into T-Mobile from AT&T, Verizon, et cetera. And then lastly, what we have that's different in those particular markets is we have a dedicated and focused team where we are building out hundreds of stores about a little bit more than 400 stores since we have started this venture out in the smaller markets and rural areas. So when you look at what's happened under the ground, strong demand really getting after it in 40% of the U.S. from smaller markets and real areas and then when you look at the overall health and the quality of the customer that we are talking to, it's never been better. Right."

You know we have a longstanding goal to be the growth leader in business and I am really pleased to see that we are making very nice progress towards doubling our market share. We are growing in customers and in revenue. And we are taking share from AT&T and Verizon. In fact, in Q1, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, our business account growth, our phone net adds and our phone churn were all better than Verizon. And while AT&T reported declines in FirstNet quarter-over-quarter, we saw a 2.5 times growth in Connecting Heroes. So we are winning and we are winning across every segment. In Enterprise, we were selected to be the exclusive partner nationwide for AAA to develop roadside connectivity using partners like Dialpad with a collaboration tool and in our phone solutions. Siemens Energy selected T-Mobile their exclusive partner, UPS, Oracle, Dell Resorts. These are all companies that are choosing T-Mobile, because of the quality, the value and the performance of our network. In the government space, I will add, I am actually really proud of the team for the work that we have been doing with Veteran Affairs. The VA just selected T-Mobile as a primary partner for nine years with over 50,000 phone lines, as well as to create health care 5G solutions in the vertical. So we are very excited about that. In SMB, what I can say in SMB is that, we have seen net positive port trends versus Verizon for four quarters straight in a row. So it's great profitable rates, great CLVs, competing not only like I said, on the best value, but also a superior product and experience. You know businesses buy because they have tested the product and we surpassed the competition. Yeah."

            "name": "Ulf Ewaldsson",
            "content": "Thank you. Mike Sievert ... will continue to keep us ahead in this race over the next years with our great spectrum assets in both depth and breadth deployed rapidly and our rapid execution of our unique process called customer-driven coverage, and finally, continued leadership in implementing advanced technologies such as standalone 5G and multi-carrier aggregation. All of these things, importantly are contributing to the best capital efficiency in our sector. All of these strengths, coupled with our unique opportunity in underpenetrated markets are what enables a differentiated and profitable growth strategy that separates us from the competition, and you know what, we showed that again in Q1. We added 287,000 postpaid account net additions, the highest reported in the industry once again. And that means we are winning the switching decisions in the market, because this looks at it at the account level. And we had postpaid net additions of 1.3 million, more than AT&T and Verizon combined. This included postpaid phone net adds of 538,000. We won a higher share of net adds year-over-year even as the industry continues to moderate, just like we predicted we would in previous calls. Our increased share was driven by our strong phone gross adds, as well as being the only national wireless provider to improve postpaid phone churn year-over-year. Our consistent approach to profitable growth continues to deliver right on and sometimes even above our ambitious plans and that's even as the competitive landscape continues to shift and evolve. In recent quarters, we have seen cable giving away three first lines that don't, by the way, appear to be incrementally pulling from existing customers and incumbent providers but definitely are driving their ARPUs down. We have seen AT&T and Verizon significantly outspend us in media advertising. I mean Verizon alone spent almost 60% more than T-Mobile in Q1. And we continue to see, as I mentioned earlier, others lean into expensive long-term device contract offers to lock up their customers, while T-Mobile was the only one who improve churn year-over-year and have the lowest upgrade rate. Improving churn, but with the lowest upgrades, that's because our approach is not to slam customers with expensive unwanted upgrade contracts to tie them down for three years. Customers genuinely choose to stay with T-Mobile for the network, for the value proposition and for the experiences. And you know what? That's how we want it to be. You have heard us say before, our strategy is differentiated and durable, because it's driven by taking share in the places where we continue to be underpenetrated relative to the market, but where we now have new permission to win. This profitable growth playbook and the momentum we saw in Q1 is exactly what gives us the confidence to raise our postpaid net add and financial guidance for the year. A perfect example of this, T-Mobile for Business where we just posted one of our highest ever phone net add quarter in Q1 with the lowest business phone churn in our history and we are profitably taking share with more business account net adds and more business phone net adds than Verizon in the quarter. On the consumer side, we are winning with prime network seekers in the top 100 markets who increasingly recognize that T-Mobile offers the best combination of network coverage and capacity for their needs. In fact, our prime customer base hit an all-time high again this quarter. And in smaller markets and rural areas, we are now capturing a win share of switchers in the upper 30s and that's in the roughly two-thirds of this geography where we are competing. This is great news, because it's showing that our strategy here is very much on track. In addition, we added 523,000 high-speed Internet customers as we have continued to grow our gross adds every quarter since we launched two years ago. I would expect that we added more broadband customers than AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter combined for the fourth consecutive quarter. And not only did we have the highest net adds, but our focus on profitable growth translated into strong financial performance with core adjusted EBITDA up 9% year-over-year and free cash flow up over 45%. Our Q1 results were just the latest example of how we have lots of room to run at T-Mobile and I am confident in our ambitions for this year and beyond. One thing you have come to expect from this management team is that we are never satisfied, and you saw that again with our latest Un-carrier move to free customers from three-year contracts and introduce new Go5G plans that offer even more value than before. As proud as I am of what we have accomplished in our 10 years as the Un-carrier and in Q1 most recently, I am even more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile and I am so thankful that all of you are on this journey with us. Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about the key financial highlights and our updated guidance for 2023. Right. I mean if we start with the breadth, we continue to build out and we are now reporting the 275 million as you catch here and we are -- have about 25 million to go. We are very confident that we are going to reach the 300 million by the end of the year. It gets harder and harder. And as a rule of thumb, I would say that, it's about 3 times harder for every 10 million that you add. So that's about how hard it gets. And the reason is, of course, the geography of the U.S., where it's a very vast geography with a very high population density in some communities. So it's very easy when you start out and it gets harder and harder to do it. But we are very confident that we are going to reach that with the build plan that we have today. When it comes to the depth of the network, it's just amazing how we continue to just move more and more frequency assets over from LTE to 5G. We today have 150 megahertz dedicated on our mid-band, which is giving us tremendous speeds. We have increased our speed advantage on the downlink speeds compared to competition in this last quarter and we are actually going to end up the year with 200 megahertz of dedicated spectrum just on the mid-band. So it's just fantastic to see that journey moving forward with our tech team."

We are moving now from 200 -- this quarter we are reporting 275 million POPs covered by with this mid-band spectrum and we are moving towards 300 coverage by the end of the year, giving us new opportunities also to serve other HSI opportunities. Then I would say that we are always looking at millimeter wave when we are doing trials and testing, but it's limited in reach and we have to remember that it's limited in reach and we will put it into an economic formula over time to see if it makes sense to pursue it."

        "speaker7": {
            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Hi, everybody. Well, welcome to the call, and as you can see, we are coming to you live from Bellevue, Washington at our headquarters and I am here gathered with a great group of our senior leadership team as we share with you some terrific results that we are posting today to kick off 2023. And I will start by saying our results for Q1 continue to demonstrate that no matter the competitive environment, our unique formula of offering the best network and the best value continues to produce best-in-class outcomes. We again led the industry in postpaid and broadband customer net adds, while continuing to deliver the best profitability growth. And our consistent focus on reliably translating customer growth into industry-leading postpaid service revenue growth and unlocking substantial cash flow gives us the confidence to raise our full year guidance just one quarter into the new year. Now I will also say Q1 was a quarter of celebration at T-Mobile. I am so proud of how our now 10-year history of more than 20 Un-carrier moves have transformed to this wireless industry and more recently, broadband for the benefit of customers, and as you often hear us say, we won't stop. So we announced last week our latest Un-carrier move with Phone Freedom, a move aimed to free customers and other wireless providers locked into those three-year contracts, while they are subjected to relentless pricing changes and gadgets. We continue to make it easier for customers to come to T-Mobile and switch to T-Mobile for peace of mind, knowing that with price lock, we won't raise their price for top text and data. And now with new one too are part of Phone Freedom, they will be upgrade-ready in two years, because three years is too long to force customers to wait. Here's kind of a crazy sort of fact to get your head around, AT&T reported the lowest postpaid phone churn in the industry this quarter and yet quantitative research states that their customers have the highest self-reported likelihood of switching away. Their customers report being almost 50% more likely to switch than Verizon's or T-Mobile's customers. The lowest churn, but the highest apparent dissatisfaction. And to me, that means one thing. Their customers are trapped and we are here to solve it and that's what our latest Un-carrier move is all about. That's what Phone Freedom is all about. And it's the way we have been designing our groundbreaking Un-carrier moves for a full decade now. And as you know, we hit another milestone this month, the three-year anniversary of our merger. We are wrapping up an integration that many have deemed, and I think, we will conclude that it is, the most successful merger in telecom history. And most of all, we are celebrating what it was always about, the dream we had of leapfrogging from last place in the 4G era to leadership in the 5G era, smashing the biggest pain point of all by finally giving customers in this industry both, the best network and the best value from the same provider. And you know what? We did it and we did it ahead of schedule, meeting our commitments and unlocking massive value in the process. And yeah, we brought about a new level of competition to this market and a 5G network to America that would not have been possible without this merger and that makes customers and businesses everywhere, the real winners. Speaking of network, another round of results are in and our team is again celebrating wins as the largest, fastest and most awarded 5G network as well as the best overall network for the second quarter in a row according to Ookla. And this is not just a snapshot in time. It is a durable network lead. And I am confident that Ulf and team in his new role as President of Technology, congratulations and thank you for stepping in to lead us... Hey, Phil. I will start and maybe turn to Mike and Peter. First of all, we are really excited about this new lineup. But I want to point out a couple of things. One, Magenta MAX continues to be in the lineup and so this is being added to Magenta MAX. And as we think about the price point represented by these kind of mainstream popular plans, we are going to be kind of thinking of it as Magenta MAX and higher. So that would include Magenta MAX, it would include the new Go5G Plus Plan kind of as a category. And what you see is, our expectation is that, that run rate we have been seeing in that 60s will carry forward and we have certainly seen that since the launch and it was true for Magenta MAX all through Q1. So really great to see that our popular plans are also our highest value plans packed with the things T-Mobile customers are looking for. And maybe, Mike, you can talk about -- unpack that a little bit. Peter? Thanks, Phil. Yeah. Operator, next question, please? Hey, Simon. Okay. Yeah. I will start and then we will see who wants to jump in. There's a bunch there. First of all, you are asking about our fiber trials. And I don't have a lot new to report there, other than this is a team that, obviously, through our leadership in high-speed Internet and 5G is very committed to being winners in broadband. And so for us, being able to get involved, learn, understand what drives CLV, understand the service models, the technology models, et cetera, is something that's very important and you see us continuing to do that. We haven't taken any decisions beyond that other than anything we learn there is accretive to us being in this business and you see that we are already in this business as a major player in the 5G variant. As it relates to what we are seeing in the business itself, I am very pleased. I mean Net Promoter Scores for this business continue to be higher than average cable and higher-than-average fiber in the country. So people love what T-Mobile is serving up to them and that's important and it informs the churn models, as you are saying. Now we have a very young base and so to your point, we look at it on a cohorted view and some of those aging customers from earlier, we really like what we are seeing in terms of their retention. So really pleased and you can see Net Promoter Score as kind of an indicator of that. Mike, why don't you jump in, anything else you want to share on that? Okay. And last part of your question was about where do we go beyond our current model and I want to remind everybody what the current model is before answering that, because it kind of speaks to the opportunity here, because others have side eye to what we are doing and said, well, you know there's a limited opportunity to that. What they are doing over there, and we are like, well, right. I mean we have said that all along. We expect this to be a 7 million unit to 8 million unit opportunity the way we are doing it right now, which is essentially selling excess capacity on our network. So remember, the way this works is, we have created a nationwide mapping of every household in this country, map them to every sector on every tower and determined which sectors no normal amount of mobile wireless use will take up our rapidly expanding capacity and that is where we approve applicants for high-speed Internet on 5G. So we are essentially selling our excess capacity. We see that, that takes us into those high single-digit millions of households in the planning period. Now the question that you asked about millimeter wave is really part of a broader question that says, whether for millimeter wave or not, would we entertain the idea of a capital burden to 5G home Internet plan. And yeah, we would entertain that. It would have to be smart. We would have to have a way to make it capital efficient. We haven't taken any decisions on that. I don't know if you want to share a little bit of our thinking or kind of what we see as the opportunity of, but the short answer of it is we haven't taken a decision on it, but of course, we are interested in it. Terrific. Thanks for joining the call. All right. Operator, next question, please. Hi, John. Great. So competition and buyback. I will start on competition and then turn to Jon Freier. I would say, it's competitive out there. And that being said, I have probably done 50 of these calls for T-Mobile and that's been the case for all 50 of them. It's competitive out there and we have made it more competitive through the creation of this version of T-Mobile. What I said in my prepared remarks is that we have demonstrated time and time again that regardless of the competitive mill, we find our way through to accretive profitable growth, and that's because our strategy is so differentiated. So I am not going to repeat all that here, other than to say, of course, it's really competitive. I find the industry a rational level of competition, even the competitors you talked about have been pulsing in and out. Some of the offers have been eyebrow raising but they pulse in and out. I think to me, it feels competitive and rational and we look at our differentiated strategy. And what we have within our control and we see our way through to increasing our overall guidance for the year. But maybe tell us on the ground, Jon, what your team is seeing as we compete last quarter and this quarter. So it's been two years and we have made our way halfway from 13% to 16.5% market share and we are only really competing in two-thirds of the space. It's just been this rapid fire deployment, and it's -- you should be so proud of what's happening there. Jon, at the risk of filibustering your competition question, I have one more thing. I feel like we shouldn't answer a question about competition unless we talk about cable. And we are a very competitive company, so one thing I will give our team a little bit of credit on is that, we have pretty good diagnostics and telemetry on what's going on in the marketplace and so we are able to kind of see what happens with each of the competitors as the quarter unfolds and I can make a couple of predictions for you. You saw it in Comcast numbers this morning, very strong. Charter had a blockbuster quarter, we think, in phone net additions and we saw that unfolding through the quarter. But one of the things we try to do when we sort of make out -- at least for us, when we make our operating decisions is we try to figure out, well, what's behind it and double click into it. And what we see going on is that, for example, in this big number, they are about to report, about 75%, we think, of the uptick from prior normal levels, let's say, a year ago, are in non-parts sort of printed net adds, like drop you a free line in the bag or kind of low calorie net adds. And so we try to kind of adjust for that when we make our operating decisions as to how fast to run and where and how to compete, because they are really -- it's kind of a quantitative easing happening in the marketplace. There's just new adds being printed that don't appear to be coming from any of the incumbent players. So it's kind of important to adjust for all that, at least for us, as we make our operating decisions. It looks to us about 75% of the uptick has been those kinds of nets. So you actually asked two questions, yeah, your second question was about the buyback. And let me say a couple of things and I will turn it over to Peter. Like, I wouldn't read too much into how fast we are going and I cannot make any predictions for you as to how that will play out in the future. I could just tell you that generally speaking, we are going fast because we think we are getting a relative great deal on the stock and it's not normal for management to talk a lot about valuation. But since you have hired us to conduct this buyback on your behalf, we have to make operating decisions with an idea in mind about whether or not we are getting a relative value. And our team thinks and our Board thinks it is and so we have authorized moving quickly, because we look at this rapidly developing cash flow picture and a lot of people are increasingly valuing T-Mobile on our value relative to cash production and we see a lot of potential ahead for a diminishing opportunity for us to be able to grab shares at these share prices and so we are moving really fast. I cannot predict for you, though, what that means going forward, obviously, we are going to take it one step at a time. Okay. We better keep moving. We gave you quite an answer there, John. Operator, next question? You bet. Hey, Jonathan. Okay. Sounds great. Well, let's go first to Callie. I will just say she's going to give you exactly what you asked for, which is some color on what's going on, but probably not what was behind what you asked for, which is lots of racking and stacking of market share numbers and things like that. We are moving really fast here and we want to keep it competitive as to some of the details. But maybe tell us what you are seeing in the marketplace? It could be a little bit of a canary in the coal mine for us, too, because of that fact, that last fact that you just shared, Callie, that businesses aren't going so much on brand reputation. They actually check out the phones, like sometimes hundreds of them before making these decisions and compare us head-to-head. And so businesses through their testing now that we now have the best network and we do get questions about, well, how are you going to keep competing if the incumbent guys just keeps slashing their prices to hang on to those customers. And what is missed in that dialogue is that that's not actually the only factor going into this decision process. I mean businesses have corporate liable lines for a reason. They want to take responsibility for this connection, because it's mission-critical and we can save them some money. I mean we are the Un-carrier, but they are picking us because we are the best network. And that's been a breakthrough that I would say was not the case the same way a couple of years ago. So you are hearing a lot of optimism there. One thing we did here as we listened in, were some in the industry is kind of saying, hey, there's a sort of a sector decline happening, lots of layoffs, companies aren't interested in business lines anymore, there's sort of a pause going on. That is not our experience and you can hear that in the optimism of what Callie is saying. Okay, your second question was about Phone Freedom and what's going on there. So maybe we will start with Mike and then there was a particular EBITDA outlook question associated with Peter. Good stuff. Okay. How do we go over to the ones coming in on Twitter. So all get ready, there's -- you are always popular and your topic is always popular online. Let's see. I will go to Bill Ho [ph], I want to talk about the network. And this is really about -- he's giving some stats here, but I think the question is really about, can you tell us about depth and breadth. So we have 275 million people covered by ultra-capacity 5G mid-band and we are going to 300 million. How easy or hard is it in these last 25 million or how easy or hard is it in the last 100 million and that's kind of interesting if you compare to where the competitors are right now and what's still ahead of them. But then in that, can you also talk about the depth, how much spectrum is where we are going? Which means with each passing day, the overall capacity of this network is rapidly expanding. It's a fascinating thing when you listen to what Ulf says too, about how the easy part is that first 100-and-something million POPs, right, which generally corresponds to where our competitors are. And so we get questions a lot about, hey, you guys jumped out with a couple of year lead in 5G, aren't they catching you. And hopefully, you can understand when you see where we already are and where we are at the end of the year. Now there's still years behind us because that last part is really difficult and it's really important for the overall perception that a customer has about the brand. You have to be great outside the core urbans with a high capacity offering for somebody to believe you have a high capacity offering. And that matters to them even if they don't leave that space all the time. So it's really important, and it's one of the many reasons why we have a durable leap. Okay. Should we go back to the calls? Let's do it. Operator, next question, please? Hi, Brett. Okay. You bet. Great. Next question, please? Hey, Michael. Great. I will start with the DISH one and then give Mike a chance to think up and answer on the eSIM one. The -- no, we don't have visibility into it yet. DISH asked for an extension in the decision. We didn't object to that of about 60 days. And the way our consent decree works is it's entirely up to them. We are here to support them and so we will wait to hear what they decide. I am in touch with Charlie. So as I learn more, we may engage and be able to be helpful in that. But it's -- the way it works is it's entirely up to them and so if they want the spectrum under the terms of the consent decree, it's theirs. And if not, the way it works is that it would go to auction and it would maybe be in the hands of someone else. And so we will wait and see how it all unfolds and we are here to support whatever decision that they make. On eSIM, this is fascinating how this has all happened across the industry and there hasn't been that much discussion about it. One of the limiters has been this phone locking phenomenon that we are talking about with Phone Freedom. Because what happens with an eSIM is on a locked phone, even though that second SIM is available, if the phone is locked, you still can't use that second SIM very easily and so there's been some barriers to the friction coming out of the system, the way eSIM may be promised. But we are big fans of it. You saw us a few months ago, introduced great switching capabilities for you to actually try our network on the second SIM if your phone allows that. That's been a lot of fun for people to be able to test drive our network. But, Mike, maybe you can give some color on what we are seeing. Okay. How about... ... twitter, Roger Adler [ph] want to talk about T-Mobile for Business. I think we hit most of that, unless you want to provide any color on what we are seeing with HSI in T-Mobile for Business. And then a separate question about, with our new Go5G plans, they are raised prices, do we think that will impact our subscriber growth. And I am glad you asked that, because, no. And in fact, the way we kind of did this is we added these plans and that won't be immediately obvious to everybody, but we added them. So if you present at retailer online, you can still get Magenta and Magenta MAX. But these new plans in the early days, now that we have put them out there, they are really turning out to be very popular and so I am not worried -- even notwithstanding the fact that they are being added, I am not worried at all. These are going to be really popular plans, because we design them right to the needs that we are hearing customers want in the marketplace. And this is really an interesting thing, because we called it Go5G for a reason. Our 5G customers are using massive amounts of data on our network. And people say, what's the killer app of 5G. There are a lot of killer apps of 5G, but one of them is usage on your smartphone, which if you have T-Mobile and Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, you have massive connectivity and customers are soaking it up and that's a real differentiator for us. And so we want to play into that advantage and encourage that kind of usage, because once they see what their phone can do, they are not going to want to live without it. We are already seeing that now at scale with millions of customers at Magenta MAX or above. Okay. So let's go back to the phone, Jud. Operator, next question, please? Yeah. Look, on the first one and I will turn to Mike for the second one. On the first one, Craig, I am not going to answer it, because my friend, John think he kind of did answer it and I think he was very unfairly misquoted. He gave an innocent answer to a hypothetical kind of along the lines of any time there's spectrum, of course, we are interested and there are all kinds of headlines whether he wants to buy a DISH of the spectrum. Listen, first of all, I will say, I think, it's a little premature question too. I don't count DISH or Charlie out very easily. I have known him for a long time. So I think it's a premature question. But then finally, it raises a larger issue. And if you reframe it this way, which is, does this wireless industry have enough spectrum over the long haul for American competitiveness. I'd say never, always there's an opportunity for more and that speaks to public policy. The FCC lost its auction authority this year and T-Mobile and others have been urging Congress to restore that, because we need our strong regulatory body to be able to work with other agencies, create an ongoing long-term pipeline of spectrum for all the players in this industry so that we can continue to have connectivity in this country that's the best in the world. And I know the FCC feels that way. I presume my competitors feel that way. But I think it's very important that we get back on track with this and that actions that are completed get put to use for the American consumer, because there's work that's pending there and that the FCC regains its authority quickly to be able to lead in this space going forward, the way they have done so well in the past. And I think that's very important for our company, for our competitors, but also for American competitiveness. Your second question is about apps in 5G. 5G -- it was sort of -- it kind of came out and I will say our competitor's kind of led the way on this with a lot of hype and euphoria around 20 gigabit connectivity in millimeter wave and it's going to change the world and we are all going to be kind of human cyborgs and stuff like that. And we kind of never felt that way. I mean early on, we went right to 5G is a much better, like 10 times better at least 4G and that the killer apps are going to be smartphones at first and they are going to be our ability to get after home broadband. And we focused on the mid-band asset and eventually the rest of the industry followed. We were right. And the average T-Mobile customer is getting 10 times the connectivity that they got in 2018, 10 times faster. That's amazing. And so what they are doing with it is amazing and so that obviously is unfolding. But there's still the kind of side eye questions people get, which is where is all this augmented reality you said would come? And I'd say, well, first of all, our job is to create a great network and we have the best in the country. And as hardware and software developers look to a network to create innovations around, I think, they will choose T-Mobile. Whether they are moving faster or slower than predicted, doesn't directly affect our business that much. We need to be the network that they choose as they get inspired with massive connectivity, not just in fits and starts and parts of the country, but all across this country the way T-Mobile can uniquely provide and that's why we work with developers the way we do. But the rate and pace they go, that's up to them. Anything to add? Terrific. That's right. Oh! It's the last one already. We are just getting warmed up. Yeah. Sure. We maintain and have for the entire decade long journey of the Un-carrier an envelope of superior pricing versus our benchmark competitors and we intend for that to continue. Now as things shift and move, we maintain that envelope and it's not a matter of sort of a static price or being dogmatic about price has always got to be static, but we always want to be a relative value. And we can do that sustainably because we have a great balance sheet, we have the right capital structure, we have the right spectrum structure and other advantages that allow us to continue to profitably have a pricing envelope superiority versus our benchmark competitors. But as things move in the market with inflation or otherwise, of course, there's an opportunity for us to move along with those things. But we have the customers are North Star and our brand value proposition to take care of. That's why you have seen us so focused on offering higher value offers that customers self-select up to and it really shows their love for our brand that when we put something out there like Magenta MAX or now Go5G Plus, they flock to it. They -- our customers are buying up our rate card voluntarily in an era of inflation, because they appreciate the value of what we are putting in front of them. That speaks a lot about the brand and about the covenant between us and our customers on this brand. Okay, your first question was about the SoftBank true-up shares. And just to kind of remind everybody, there is this 48 million some shares that would trigger upon $150 stock price being at an average 45-day VWAP. And the short answer to your question is, of course, I mean, of course, we talk to them. They are a close partner of ours. We talk to DT all the time. We are aware of this question and this issue. But we have nothing to report. And so -- but I mean it's of interest, and it's not lost on us why you are asking the question. If there ever was to be a transaction, it has to be something that would work for everyone. I will say this, and the earlier question about our buyback pace, we have already bought back more shares than this potential dilution event and we intend to buy back a lot more shares going forward, should our capital program continue to support that as we have outlook it would. And so this is actually a fairly small potential event in the grand scheme of the shareholder remuneration that our cash flow production supports. And so anyway, with that, anything to add to that? Perfectly said. Anything to add to the whole show? All right. Well, we appreciate you guys. Thanks for tuning in and for asking all these questions. I am so proud of our team. It's a fascinating year. It was fascinating for us to watch how it all started and the different perceptions people have. But one thing I hope that you take away from us is that, we are a team maniacally focused on delivering for you what we promised you we would do and that's what we show up and try to do every single time and I am so proud that this was one more quarter where we were able to put down great results and outlook for you in 2023 that we are going to be proud of. So thanks for tuning everybody. See you later."

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a post to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathy Au, Senior Vice President of Investor relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\nKathy Au : Good afternoon. Welcome to T-Mobile's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on our call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO, as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book, and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call, can be found in the quarterly results section of the investor relations website. With that, let me now turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert : OK, thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the Q3 call. We're coming to you from Bellevue today, and I'm joined by several members of our senior leadership team to talk about another outstanding quarter for T-Mobile. Now, given our recent Capital Markets Day, Peter and I are going to keep our remarks pretty light so that we can get right to your questions. And before I get into our quarter, I do want to take a moment to recognize our team for their hard work around the clock to help our customers, fellow employees, and communities to get back on their feet in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton. It was devastating to have back-to-back storms of this scale form in such rapid succession, but I am so proud of how our team showed up. From readiness to recovery, their tireless efforts and use of innovative technologies made a huge difference in affected communities. Okay, turning to the quarter. In short, it was a really strong one. In fact, Q3 is an example of the consistent execution we talked about a few weeks ago as a core enabler of our bold multi-year plan. As you know, achieving that plan is predicated on delivering strong results reliably and repeatedly to keep pace with our ambition. And we did just that in Q3, empowering us to raise our 2024 guidance yet again. I'll start with our mobile business. We delivered the best Q3 postpaid phone net adds in a decade, fueled by record low Q3 postpaid phone churn and continued year-over-year growth in gross adds. We also continued to lead the industry in share of switchers, and we grew share of households in both top 100 and smaller markets and rural areas. Our powerful combination of our best network, best value, and best customer experience continues to be a winning formula. We believe we have lots of room to run in our underpenetrated areas and segments, including among those who shop primarily on network attributes all across this country. Now, you heard us lay down some pretty audacious digitalization goals at our Capital Markets Day event, and we're making steady progress. I'm proud to share that our total digital mix of iPhone launch sales in Q3 is up 40% just year-over-year, and that for the first time the majority of T-Mobile branded iPhone pre-orders this year were digital. This highlights the early progress we've already begun to make in further simplifying and digitalizing and transforming the customer buying experience, and it validates the appetite our customers have for buying online, when they are given the option for a more seamless process. Our customer momentum also continues in broadband, where we delivered industry-leading net adds once again and reached a major milestone of 6 million customers in just three years. We're now halfway to our long-term target of 12 million customers by 2028. Our performance is fueled by our leading 5G network, which was recently awarded once again as having the best 5G availability in the world by Opensignal. And our industry-leading technology will continue to further differentiate us, as more and more new handsets come into the marketplace that can take advantage of our new technologies like voiceover new radio, our incredible four-way carrier aggregation technology, and so many other things. Across the board, our team is doing awesome work to further extend our 5G network leadership, for the benefit of customers. And they're noticing the superior speed, capacity, and consistency relative to our competition. Okay, moving on to our financials. In Q3, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable customer growth, which we translated to industry-leading service revenue growth, including year-over-year post-paid service revenue growth about 2 times that of peers, driven by our highest ARPA growth in seven years, as we continue to deepen customer relationships. Our core adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% led the industry by a wide margin. That combined with our unparalleled capital efficiency led once again to industry leading free cash flow conversion. I said I'd keep it brief, so let me sum it up. Our formula for generating outsized value creation from focusing on smart and profitable growth continues to work really well. We have lots of runway ahead of us to continue to deliver profitable industry leading growth as we drive forward on the ambitious plan we shared with you last month. Okay, Peter, over to you to provide an update on our guidance, please.\nPeter Osvaldik : All right. Thanks, Mike, and thanks everybody for joining us. As Mike highlighted, we delivered yet another fantastic quarter and are raising our guidance yet again. So let me provide a quick update on our expectations for 2024. Starting with customers, we are once again raising total postpaid customer net additions and now expect between $5.6 million and $5.8 million, up $150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the postpaid phone customer net additions component of that total to be approximately 3 million for the full year. We expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up around 3% year-over-year with industry-leading service revenue growth continuing to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.6 million and $31.8 billion for the full year, up $50 million at the midpoint. Turning to Cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.8 billion and $9 billion, unchanged at the midpoint. Our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we outlined for you at our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. And finally, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17 billion, up $50 million at the midpoint, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency, resulting in industry-leading service revenue to free cash flow conversion. In closing, when we spoke with you all a few weeks ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined an ambitious plan of evolving from challenger to champion. One that requires consistently strong execution. Our Q3 results are another proof-point on that journey with our unique combination of the best value, best network, and best experiences, continuing to resonate with customers. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy?\nKathy Au : Okay, let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: Our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nSimon Flannery: Great, thank you very much. Good evening. I wonder, Mike, if you could just talk to the buyback or Peter, the pacing of that. It sounds like you were very active in the last few weeks, but less so in Q3. I remember last quarter you'd been active in June. Was that the grid -- was that Capital Markets Day? What's the thought about this and how you think about the rest of this because obviously it's been sort of stop start for a little while here. And then Peter, maybe just help us on wholesale. You'd message that there would be impacts there from ongoing secular factors from ACP, from Mint Mobile, just help us level set as we see this down to the sort of [$700 million] (ph) at quarter level. Is there still some more to go there? How should we think about that going forward? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: I think, Simon. First of all, I'll hand it to Peter for both those questions. But first of all, I just want to say congratulations to you on your retirement and thank you -- first of all, for keeping us all honest. But I also know that investors have hung on your every word for many years, and you've served them so well. So we're all going to miss you. And I thought maybe your last question would be a softball. But instead, come on, Peter. What happened with those buybacks? You don't ever disappoint there, Simon.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, thank you so much, Simon. You know, what happened, both on the Q2 call, we anticipated to be back in the marketplace, And we saw a similar dynamic happen after our Q2 call, as we saw before Q2. And that was our trading plan really didn't anticipate the faster than expected or earlier than expected run up in the share price. And what that meant for us is really, it gave us an opportunity after that happened a second time to step back and rethink strategically how we wanted to approach the buybacks. And we did that. And now you see something that's less informed by quick movements towards where we think it's going and more of a consistent execution. Still thoughtful of many factors. Of course, I can't get into all of those, but it's a little bit of a change in strategy. And that's what you saw happen after that strategic change. Since that point, we've been in the market place consistently. So that's the buyback story. And you know, on wholesale, much like I said, in 2025, what we expect is the trough of wholesale and other service revenue. And underpinning that though, there's actually growth in wholesale and our partnerships if you consider, as you mentioned, both the ACP decline, which we now expect to be towards the higher end of that [$350 million to $450 million] (ph) range that we gave previously. And of course, the long planned transition of TracFone away to Verizon, as they complete that merger integration. So the underlying dynamics are great when you take out the ACP and the TracFone. And that's what we expect as we hit that trough to continue to fuel growth past 2025.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thanks a lot.\nMike Sievert: You bet. Okay.\nKathy Au: Operator next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nJohn Hodulik: Hey, thank you. Maybe two if I could guys. First on spectrum, there's been some, you know, some move -- you guys have made some moves in the market. It looks like you're trading some of your 3.45 for some 2.5. Just any thoughts on the strategy there? Obviously Verizon buying some spectrum from USM. Are you guys also in the market for additional spectrum at the right price? Maybe an update on the 800 megahertz spectrum. That's one topic that didn't come up at your Capital Markets Day. And then secondly, some good info on the digitalization efforts, Mike. I mean, is there a way for you to sort of frame or quantify maybe the potential upside or improvement in costs you can get as you sort of work through that process? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Well, let's do the digitalization one first, John. If you recall at Capital Markets Day, we laid out a pretty ambitious plan for value creation over the years. And Signal Day 2027 core adjusted EBITDA, about $10 billion at the high point of our guidance above 2023 levels. And so that kind of shows you the potential. Now a lot of that's revenue growth, which is partly driven by digitalization. And a lot of that is recrafting the underlying operation, getting more precise in our marketing, preventing customer problems that are a source of so much value loss in this industry. And so we didn't unpack all the details of which parts to drive which parts. But I can tell you that we arrived at that plan after working on it for almost two years. And after detailing out a 14-quarter quarter-by-quarter detailed plan of what will land when. So that we have the barometers of knowing if we're running ahead of our plan that we can increase our promises to you. If it looks like we're going to be running behind, we can course correct, that's how we do these things. And if you go back to our 2021 plans when a lot of people thought what we said back then was unbelievably ambitious, and we did it. But we did it because we had a detailed plan. We don't always provide a lot of transparency. I think we do a good job there. We provide more than others on transparency, but we also have to keep some of the secret sauce to ourselves for competitive reasons. To make sure you saw the barometers underneath that, though, we put some markers out there. We said we wanted person-to-person customer service interactions to be reduced by 75% in the planning horizon. That's a big marker. We said we wanted the majority of all activations to be digital and many other markers that we put out there. And one of the things that Peter said was that the actual business plan that we laid out didn't assume full achievement of each of those KPIs. So in a world where we deliver each and every one of those KPIs, there is upside beyond the guidance range. And so we try to put out a plan that's realistic, but at the same time, ambitious. And that's kind of what we mean by Challenger to Champion. It's a plan for the future that's an evolution from Challenger to Champion that really causes us to have to do things that nobody's ever done and really rethink how this industry works, as you see us doing in so many ways. And hopefully, that came across well at Capital Markets Day. Now switching to spectrum. You asked a couple of different questions. One of them was about 3.45 specifically, and I'll just ask Ulf to talk about what's going on there.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Right. Well, thanks, Mike. Well, on our journey, when we are building our network, which is a dense 5G multilayer network. We are always working with our different layers and the different spectrum assets we have. We have a superior sub-6 gigahertz holding, today which is providing us with our enormous capacity benefit. And in that, we always value spectrum short-term, long-term and mid-term. And we see that 3.45 is not part of this plan. So that's why we did it. Then this transaction goes through a number of different approvals and so on, and we will see. But the way we did it, we are very satisfied, I could say, with how it came out. On the 800 band, we concluded the auction without really a bid that was qualifying. That gives us now new optionality really. We can either deploy it or we could look at doing something to benefit monetarily from it. So we have those optionalities as we go forward. We're always working on our spectrum portfolio and continue to build this leading 5G network based on it.\nMike Sievert: Hope that answer the question, John.\nKathy Au: Okay. Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Barden: Hi guys. Thanks so much. So I guess to start, I guess, would be for Mike, you were in Germany at the DT-CMD, where they kind of elaborated on the hope that they would see that their interest -- ownership interest in T-Mobile would rise. I think they said to the high 50% range from the current levels. Can you elaborate a little bit on your understanding of how that timing might work because that will impact how the mechanics of the buyback on the float work, and it could magnify that effect and make it much more beneficial for the US investors? And then the second question, if I could, Maybe, Peter, your 3 million postpaid phone net kind of target for the year implies about 100,000 reduction in year-over-year nets in fourth quarter versus flat year-over-year in the third quarter. Is that just being conservative? Or is there something else to watch out for? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Well, I'll start, Dave. And I'm sorry to disappoint you without being able to really answer the question much. I guess the prototypical answer would be, you kind of have to ask them. I will say that in this long journey, being an independent company with DT, as our controlling shareholder. We've seen their position range from the 40s to the mid-60s. They've maintained controlling stake the entire time, and that governance structure for us, from our lens has been pretty unchanged. In other words, the Board structure the people involved. We have all been together a long time. At this point, TMUS is a very, very important part of what they do, and they're very clear about that. We're much larger as a company than they are now, et cetera. And I think from a standpoint of governance, it really works. What's good for us is generally good for them, especially because of the relative value and size, et cetera. They've been incredibly supportive of our strategy. They're a great Board, I feel that having industry experts on our Board from DT has been very helpful to us. I think a lot of companies in our space don't have that benefit of insiders that are really able to ask the three layers of whys on all the things we want to do. And at the end of the day, this management team and this Board have made a lot of moves together that have created enormous value and success. Now they did mention that they wanted to -- they have multiple strategies and multiple capital allocation strategies that may result in them concentrating their position over time. But how -- when that happens, how that happens, whether that happens, you'll have to ask them. As to your second question?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, Dave, on the 3 million, so it's approximately 3 million from a postpaid phone perspective. And as you know, Q4 has a unique attribute in that the last couple of months, which are really in front of us here are a period of really great activity. We have certainly positioned well, as you saw in Q3. And of course, we have ambitions to outperform what we put there. But we're always cautious with the two biggest months of Q4 ahead of us, in terms of putting a guide out there that's achievable for us. So somewhere approximately in that 3 million, not right on with, of course, the ability and aspiration for us to get after it.\nDavid Barden : Perfect. Thank you guys.\nKathy Au : Thanks Dave. Operator next question please.\nMike Sievert: I will say, while we're teeing up the neck, we almost always get that question at this time of the year -- and because it's weird to have a guy with only two months left. But you also have to remember that the biggest part of the quarter is the part that's still in front of us. So every year at this time, and we do get accused of being a little cautious. I don't think it's cautious. It's just that so much is unfolding later in the quarter. I will comment that our quarter-to-date trends are spot on our plan and looking really strong. So no question marks there whatsoever.\nKathy Au: Thanks, Mike. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks good afternoon. Two questions, if I could. First, curious if you could give us an update on the journey for deepening penetration in the SMRA markets as well as within the business vertical. And then secondly, with respect to postpaid phone ARPU, it looks like it was up, I think, 1.8% year-over-year. And if I remember correctly, just from some of the discussions in the past, the base case expectation for the back half of the year may have been up 1%. And just curious if you could impact the strength in ARPU? And is there something to take from this strength as we look at future quarters? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. It turns out to be a three-part question. So I'm going to ask three different speakers to try to keep it tight. But we're going to go to Jon on SMRA, quickly to [Callie on] (ph) business and then back to Peter on ARPU, and I'm going to predict he's going to pivot you to ARPA. But, Jon?\nJon Freier: Yes. Hi, Mike. So just smaller markets in rural areas, I always take a moment to remind everyone that this is 40% of the market, 140 million people, 50 million households. We could not be more pleased with the progression of our growth in this space. Q2 was our highest win share quarter that we've ever delivered. And here in Q3, we beat Q2. And so we've got a great series of momentum happening in the marketplace where we're driving switching, winning those switching decisions, Number #1 in terms of win share in the marketplace in smaller markets and rural areas. And like I talked about at Capital Markets Day, too, the thing that built a lot of confidence for me is that our overall Net Promoter Score in smaller markets and rural areas is now number one, and it's 20% higher than the next highest competitor. For me, that builds ongoing customer advocacy, customer loyalty and continues to build that overall growth momentum that we have in that particular marketplace. And that's why we're continuing to build net new accounts in the top 100 markets as well. So we're having a lot of fun doing this. I've been talking about it for three years, and we're continuing to drive new highs in our switching activity in smaller markets and rural areas.\nMike Sievert: And I know you didn't ask out this, Mike, but one of the things we reminded you of at the Capital Markets Day is we deaverage that top 100 set of markets for you a little bit. And this dynamic that Jon is talking about that has been a huge tailwind for us in SMRA is present in a lot of those top 100 markets. There's a big part of those. Well, we're not Number #1, and some of them were not even #2. And so there's big tailwind potential there. And in all 3 types, where we're #1, where we're #2 or even while we're #3, T-Mobile is growing. So it really shows that our formula works across the board. And now to the second part of your three-part question, what's going on with the business. And by the way, Callie, while you're talking about that, maybe you could hit Chetan Sharma\u2019s question about enterprise solution deals, what are we seeing? Could you name names, what's going on out there?\nCallie Field: Okay. We'll do. Well, Jon mentioned that they're having a lot of fun. And I got to tell you, so is this TFB team. We beat our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone net adds in postpaid net adds and invoice churn. We're continuing to see profitable growth, rising CLVs in all segments. And we also just declared our ninth consecutive quarter of positive [port trends] (ph) in all segments against our competitors. In enterprise, let me narrow in specifically on a couple of the segments and some customer wins and use cases. Enterprise, we had our best activations on record. So considerable growth across all of our solutions and working with existing customers like American Airlines, where we're developing BTS solutions for their airplane operations or new logo growth with New York Life Insurance, where we are helping them combine solution with Smarsh, to make sure that their voice communications are secure. In government, we saw double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter and net adds across phone, BTS and in HSI. And a lot of that growth is supported by wins in the Fed via the Spiral 4 contract. So we are growing and winning with the Army, the Air Force and the Y-12 National Security complex. And then when I think about HSI in particular, this is one of our strongest quarters ever, highest net adds in fixed wireless. And we're doing really well. So we saw a lot of wins this quarter with retail multisite. So new customers include Lowe's, Spirit Halloween, PetSmart and then in education, where we're able to solve some connectivity problems with some of the largest school districts in the country like Houston ISD. And then again, like I mentioned before, bringing our fixed wireless solutions to the Department of Defense. And we certainly have more room to run. With [A&S] (ph), we had some really cool deployments this year. We're starting with advanced network solutions to really see our pipeline continue to grow and then continuing to see more and more deals closed each quarter, which the team is working hard against that target. Oxy Petroleum is an example, Chetan to answer your question online, where we deployed a hybrid A&S solution across of 20 of their manufacturing plants. And so that's some of the work that we've been doing this last quarter, part 3. I'll hand it to Part 3.\nMike Sievert: Great. Thanks. Well done. And ARPU trying to --.\nPeter Osvaldik: Part 3, well, I'll definitely be truthful and redirect you to ARPA in just a second. But honestly, we do see strength there. And previously, what we had said is, from an ARPU perspective, we see probably about 0.5% year-over-year increase probably now see about 75 bps of that, so a little bit of strength there. But the reason we don't focus on ARPU as much as you know, is because it is very much a mix-driven metric. And so things like the success that Callie just described in the business group where you don't have high ARPUs, you tend to have lower ARPUs with higher ARPUs, very, very strong CLVs, segment plans, things like that. That's why we pivot into ARPA and again, continued strength there and just increased our guide very exciting to be at 3% year-over-year increase from an ARPA perspective.\nKathy Au: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Peter. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin from New Street Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nJonathan Chaplin: Two, one for Ulf on the 800 megahertz again. We've seen some challenges to your request to use PCS spectrum for the direct-to-device service with Starlink. Wondering if you think those challenges posed a real sort of headwind you're being able to use that spectrum and whether 800 megahertz might be an alternative? And then, Mike, a question for you. AT&T said something that totally shocked us today that at some point, they think they could open their network, their fiber network to wholesale. I'd love to get your perspectives on that. Would it make sense for you guys if they did that to leverage their wholesale network to self-bundled products? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Great. Well, I'll start out on -- I guess, on both of them and then see if Ulf wants to add anything. On the direct-to-sell, there -- no, we don't really see any barriers to progress there. We're very much looking forward to getting our beta underway during the hurricanes, we were able to test with a temporary authorization and saw hundreds of thousands of successfully completed text messages to people that otherwise wouldn't have seen them even though our network was recovered at a remarkable pace. And so it's just -- it's getting closer and closer. We have over 200 satellites in the air. I think this will work itself out despite the obvious process that has to happen through the FCC. I think this is a fundamental good and we will be off to the races very soon. As it relates to 800, as Ulf said, there's a lot of optionality for 800 now. We were required to sell it as an artifact of the merger and the consent decree and to auction it under a set of auction rules. We did that and there wasn't a qualifying bid as defined in the consent decree. And so we're no longer are required to sell it. That gives us optionality. I'll remind you of a few things that Peter has said, one, proceeds from selling it are not currently in our financial plan. So should we sell that spectrum, that will be, in essence, incremental. And secondly, in Ulf's network plan, utilizing that spectrum is not currently in the plan. So the reason I point this out is that just we have a lot of optionality and that's valuable spectrum. It's important spectrum. And you'll have to stay tuned as it relates to our resolution on how we plan to use it. As it relates to fiber and open fiber, one of the things that has made cable kind of interesting is that you do see a certain amount of collaboration in that space because there aren't overlaps. Look, it's hard to predict what the future will look like. This is a very, very competitive market. I think it always will be very, very competitive. And that being said, a lot of things will unfold over the years, and we'll have to see what's the very best way we can serve consumers and businesses. But we're open-minded to all future constructs. I can tell you that we are very, very excited about our fiber plans, and we intend to compete vigorously with them. Our strategy is to be first to fiber in the places where we go and that's why we teamed up with some of the fastest moving players in this industry, so that we can race with abandon to provide this incredible service we know we can provide. That being said, I wouldn't speculate more on the future than that.\nKathy Au: Thank you, Jonathan, for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.\nCraig Moffett: Sure thank you. And first, let me embarrass Kathy by wishing you a happy birthday today.\nMike Sievert: Yes. Happy birthday, Cathy.\nKathy Au: Appreciate it.\nCraig Moffett: I know you are not going to forgive me for that, Kathy. Let me ask the regulatory question about upgrade rates because you like your peers, continue to see very, very low upgrade rates on handsets. My guess is the kind of the debate about whether we are going to see a big handset upgrade rate this year is largely already settled. But as you look out to next year and what at least the handset makers have said is expected to be a more robust AI-driven upgrade cycle. How do you think about that? How do you prepare for it? And how do you -- as a share gain or how do you potentially benefit from it?\nMike Sievert: Yes, a great set of questions, Craig. Why don't we start with Mike Katz and talk about the upgrade rates we're seeing and little future casting?\nMichael Katz: Yes. I mean in terms of the current upgrade rates, like you said they were low. And a lot of that is just because of what we've been talking about the last several quarters that we see customers having their natural demand met by virtue of the way that our upgrade programs work. And by virtue of how good the T-Mobile version of the 5G devices are, both in terms of penetration, we have over 80% of our customers using 5G devices. But also -- and maybe Ulf can comment on this later, some of the unique capabilities that are available in some of these devices because of our stand-alone 5G network. So what we see is customers having devices that generally work better and devices that are becoming more expensive and lasting longer. And we think all those factors have come into play affecting and you are seeing the outcomes of the upgrade rates. Looking forward, look, it is hard to predict. A lot of the OEMs don't share their long-term plans and what their devices are going to look like next year. But like -- just like going into this iPhone cycle, I'd say the next -- the same thing about next year's cycles, both with iPhone and with other OEMs. We think we're really well positioned on whether it's a big upgrade cycle or not. In the case of a big upgrade cycle, T-Mobile has constantly been the winner when there's a lot of switching in the marketplace. And we saw that again during this last iPhone launch, and it's demonstrated in a lot of the results that you saw here in Q3 with 315,000 net new accounts by far, the most out of anybody that reports in this industry. So we think in a world where there is a lot of switching because of a new device that creates a lot of upgrades because of this unique proposition of best network, best value and best experience when customers are shopping, T-Mobile is going to win. And that's, I think been demonstrated quarter-over-quarter for many years now.\nMike Sievert: Okay. Anybody want to add to that?\nUlf Ewaldsson: Well, the only comment there on the phones that Mike mentioned is that many phones are coming up and getting 2-carrier aggregation, 2-carrier aggregation in the uplink. This gives enormous benefits. It's 30% higher speeds in the downlink, 15% in the uplink. So this stuff performs really well on our network. And just a reminder on what Mike brought up is that we are the only one who has pure stand-alone core. We've had it since 2020. It's well tuned. It's rolled out over entire network, and it allows us to do these things. It allows us to the 4-carrier in the downlink, it allows us for the 2-carrier in the uplink with all those benefits for the new devices coming out. And it also allows us now to use voice over the new air interface as you mentioned in your opening, that's a huge thing. It really leads to much better call setup times. It leads to better quality, and it gives us the opportunity for more effective spectrum use.\nMike Sievert: So it is interesting, why do we say these things? Well, first of all, we pointed out for the reason Mike said, which is when people are having a fantastic experience that's differentiated with their current device at T-Mobile, then they are not as compelled to move. They're having a great experience, so they shop less. That's great. We have low upgrade rates as a result. When they wind up switching, we win because we win the switching moment. So there's not enough talking in this industry about switching, but it's very clear that these numbers show once again we're the switching winner. And if there's a super cycle in the future and that spurs switching that will be great for us. And this point that Ulf that you're pointing out around the newer devices, taking advantage of our advanced capabilities, it really speaks to another issue. At Capital Markets Day, we were pretty clear that we don't expect to just defend this 5G network lead. We expect to extend it over time. And the evidence continues to back us up on that. We are much -- our margin of superiority is greater today than it was two years ago. And one of the drivers of this is not just the rate and pace of our deploying technologies but it's the tailwind represented by the fact that a lot of the devices out there today in people's hands don't take full advantage of the network. For example, the latest iPhone 16 has advanced capabilities that are uniquely unlocked by T-Mobile's network. And the more those get in people's hands, the more it will unlock the embedded technology we've already rolled out, creating a tailwind for us to further extend our lead. And that will be a great dynamic down the road when people have those in their hands and they're faced later with weather to upgrade further and they're going to be very happy with what they have. So really nice trends unfolding there. Hope that helps, Craig?\nPeter Osvaldik: And maybe I would add just one little bit because of those dynamics that we're seeing what Mike described, as I think about Q4, we'll probably see the same seasonality from an equipment revenue perspective that we saw last year. So the same kind of absolute dollar increase that we saw Q3 to Q4 is, what I expect to happen from Q3 to this Q4. Obviously, higher than Q3 with that holiday seasonality happening there, but that's the trend that we'd expect.\nKathy Au: Thanks, Craig. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on your plans for network upgrades on the wireless side for next year. Maybe talk about the relative prioritization of your three-plus gigahertz 5G upgrades, as well as how much you plan on doing in terms of rural and markets outside of the Tier 1 against any other priorities you may have? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Jim. This might be a good opportunity for Ulf to kind of remind that we have a different approach for how to do this than many. And it's algorithmic, it's driven by deep data. And in that sense, the planfulness around big macro topics like that are a little bit different for us. In other words, we're looking now at a much more micro level than kind of a broad secular level without as much preference for whether it is rural or whether it's urban et cetera, but maybe you can explain customer-driven coverage and how it drives our priorities into 2025.\nUlf Ewaldsson: Right. And first of all, I mean, we have the greatest assets, as I said before, on the below 6 gigahertz those assets are allowing us to build a very consistent network. So means that also all the towers that we have and we have more than 80% of our towers are equipped very similarly. We are the only player in the market who has three layers dedicated to 5G. In that, when we are allowing us to build and expand this, we are using a methodology that we call customer-driven coverage. And customer-driven coverage is something we have spent about 1.5 years about developing a methodology. It's an algorithmic [etiology] (ph) based on AI where we're using billions and billions of data points that we are assessing from customer experience data across the network. We're correlating that with business data and with real customer outcomes. In other words, what customers decide to do on our network. And then we are assigning a CLV value, a customer lifetime value to a grid across the country, more than 4 million little hexagons that we have created across the country, 165 meter-wide hexagons. We are signing those values relative to competition to allow us to know exactly where we can build to please customers. Because at the end of the day, this is not a pop drive where you're just chasing populations and where populations live, it's a much more complicated art to figure out exactly where customers will value most our build. And that's what we're doing on our capital allocation. And to answer your question, Jim. It's really what we're doing on our capital allocation for next year. We're taking full advantage of our customer-driven coverage. Now looking then at our assets and our -- to your question about the 3 gigahertz band. How much do we really need to deploy that? Well, today, we have a -- and we went very smart into the auction around C-band, where we selected 50 markets where we really could see that this spectrum fits very well to our grid. So when we deploy it, it will be optimized for our grid, our tower-to-tower distance in a way that makes it very effective. And it's very -- in markets where there could potentially over time, be a need to expand our capacity. But as we see it now, it is not needed. We have so much more room to run. We are only about 60% deployed on our mid-band spectrum to 5G today. And we have much more other things that we can take an action in among the others, the technology leadership that you just explained, Mike. So that's where we are on our C-band plan.\nMike Sievert: Perfect. So Jim, what you can take away from that are a couple of things. One is with apologies. What you can take away is what you just heard. We keep a little close to the vest. How and when we will deploy each band and exactly where we will deploy. And we do that for all kinds of reasons. But one of the transparency we attempt to offer you is the following: One, we outlooked at Capital Markets Day that the $9 billion to $10 billion capital envelope is sufficient with our detailed planning to not only defend but to extend our 5G leadership and to meet the goals that we established in our business plan. We've modeled this at a very detailed level. The way -- the lens is different. The set of tools are different. They're not blunt tools like let's go after the countryside and let's go after -- it's much more algorithmic, both just described that we have tens of thousands of projects. They might be small upgrades, they might be reorientations, they might be adding C-band in the future to the premise of your question. We have tens of thousands of future projects that gets stacked-ranked based on some practical concerns like zoning permitting but mostly based on the outputs from our AI-driven algorithic model called customer-driven coverage. And the result of that will be that we will stay ahead of the demand curve and continue to extend our overall performance and 5G experience leadership in the country within the CapEx envelope that we provided to you.\nJim Schneider : That's very helpful color. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you maybe comment on whether you see anything in either your macro indicators or your underlying consumer data have you at all concerned that we are about to see a significant deceleration in the overall kind of gross add environment in the consumer wireless space. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay. And again, I'm going to apologize. I feel like you've asked me two in a row that I'm not all that well equipped to answer. And the reason why the second one is difficult is that we have sort of determined that T-Mobile or maybe even our industry writ large, is not really that great of a canary in the coal mine on macroeconomic things. And part of that is, I think, the essential nature of our service. And so we are not going to be the guys to ask to give you early indicators of changes or nuances and consumer behavior. And one of the -- and that's borne out by our numbers. Our customers are kind of per category, per segment paying at traditional norms, valuing the service, just no real secular changes there -- that are noteworthy. As it relates to growth in the industry, there are weird dynamics that are hard to predict there. We've done a pretty good job predicting our business, almost remarkably good job predicting our business. But predicting what happens sort of in the \"market growth\u201d has been more difficult. And a lot of that is because some of what gets added to the industry is kind of questionable sort of lower calorie net adds, et cetera. And it's one of the reasons why we focus so much on switching. We focus on the core business, our families on postpaid traditional plans who've been in this industry for a while and who switched to us from another provider, that continues to be just sort of at a modest rate and pace, the bread and butter of our superior revenue growth story. The other dynamic we focus on is an ongoing transference from prepaid to postpaid. Now this one could possibly be a canary in the coal mine you're looking for because we have seen over the past five years during these vibrant economic times, lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid. In this most recent quarter, we saw it yet again a strong -- I think it was 175,000 net transfers from our prepaid to our postpaid showing that, that trend just continues that one -- maybe that one would be an indicator if you see that slowdown because this is a demonstration that customers are qualifying for postpaid plans over these last five years. So that's one to watch and it continues to be in recent trends in recent history consistent with. Okay, you bet.\nKathy Au: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Supino from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Supino: Hi, and thank you. A question that's a bit longer term in nature on spectrum costs. your stock valuation multiple expansion shows a lot of market confidence in your growth outlook. And if you put your investor hat on, may you agree that the other key value driver is the cost of that growth. And so I want to ask you about a distant but potentially expensive issue, the 6G cycle. 4G and 5G costs, each of the major MNOs, tens of billions of dollars, your 5G solution with Sprint was quite elegant. I'm wondering if you'd share your view on that and whether anything about your business today sets up the long run for a different level of spectrum and RAN costs than we saw for the 4G and 5G cycles. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Well, it's a great question, Peter, and it's -- the premise of your question acknowledges this, it's a little premature. But there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the long-term trends. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to talk with you at our Capital Markets Day about our vision for what comes after this current 5G cycle. AI-RAN and what it can be. And yes, there's a potential big cycle coming. But on the other hand, it may be a cycle that's fundamentally more efficient to roll out than prior cycles. And the promises of Open RAN that have been made for years may finally be realized at scale in the AI RAN era. And this allows you to offset potential future cost of replacement of future technologies with fundamental efficiency, and so we're optimistic. We were able to indicate that for our planning horizon over the next few years, this $9 billion to $10 billion CapEx area makes sense. Now that's not full-scale 6G time frames yet. But at the same time, we wanted to put down markers about our vision for what comes next with AI brand because it's so promising on the ability to do more. One of the things that we drive our plan around is the two core metrics, which is technology over time should allow us to extract more and more network performance per CapEx and OpEx dollar and it should allow us to extract more and more network performance per unit of spectrum. And that's what has happened, and that's what we think will continue to happen. But this next cycle may be more efficient than the big verticalized 5G cycle was. I will also say that the net cost of 5G involved a big part of that cost involved our competitors rushing in to spend an inordinate amount of money to try to get mid-band spectrum and that was caused by the extra competition brought on by our merger. Had that unfolded differently, it may have happened over time. And it really showcases how much competition our merger brought to this industry and how quickly. And today, customers are the beneficiaries of that. But so is the industry. One of the things I've talked about in the past is that yet while 5G has been costly for some, overall, you see industry cash flows at or around all-time highs. And yet you see consumers benefiting with 3 times to 4 times more speed and 3 times to 4 times more data usage at similar price points to 5 or 6 years ago. So consumers are -- are giant winners from the 5G cycle, but the industry remains quite healthy as well. And I think the future bodes very nicely for 6G. One of the things we intend, like we did in 5G, when we looked around corners, and we saw that it would unfold on smartphones and in mid-band, we intend to be a company that drives the future on 6G as well. And that's why we've struck our unique partnership with Ericsson, Nokia and NVIDIA to help invent AI- RAN and bring the future about in a way that disproportionately benefits T-Mobile customers.\nKathy Au: Thank you, Peter. Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sam McHugh from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\nSam McHugh: Maybe just a follow-up on that in some ways. It's good to hear about like the consumer benefits that your scale through the Sprint deal brought. How is engagement going with different parties on the US Cellular deal, ever as much you could add on that? And then a second, just quick follow-up on the ARPU growth. I know ARPU, not ARPA. But in terms of the upside surprise, is that more of a mix effect of the gross adds? Or is it the price rise that's landed better than maybe you anticipated? Thanks very much.\nMike Sievert: Okay. I'm going to start with Peter on ARPU and ARPA. And is it mix driven? Or what's it driven by and then probably turn to Mike Katz to talk about how US Cellular is unfolding?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. ARPA is a number of factors, as you know. On the consumer side, it's a continual expansion of the relationship, including with 5G home broadband, other connected devices, really seeing strength in growth and expansion of customer relationships. Callie spoke a lot about the success in T-Mobile for business across the segments and how you see ARPA expansion there. In terms of the rate plan optimization, that was a very minor component of the year-over-year ARPA change and certainly not the driver for the 3% increase now that we anticipated really is core expansion of customer relationships that's so exciting.\nMike Sievert: Okay. And maybe while you're at it Mike, you can talk about not just US Cellular, but you might as well talk about Metronet and Lumos. We've been pretty busy out there. So what's going on with these new combinations that we have?\nMichael Katz: Yeah. We have several transactions. And I would say all of them are in the process and the processes are going really well. In terms of Lumos, we expect that to close in the first -- the first part of next year. US Cellular, which is also in the process, maybe the middle part of next year. And then Metronet, we also expect to close in 2025. So good progress through the whole regulatory process. There's obviously several different groups that have to review and approve them and feel like those are going really well so far.\nMike Sievert: We happen to have at the end of the table, one of the nation's most accomplished antitrust layers. So our General Counsel, Mark Nelson, any commentary on things we're learning as we go along.\nMark Nelson: Yes. And we've cleared -- both Lumos and Metronet have cleared the DOJ review process. They're still pending for the FCC, and that will take a little more time, as Mike just indicated, on U.S. Cellular. We think this is great for consumers. It's going to lead to lower pricing, especially for the US cellular customers. It's going to lead to better coverage for all customers. So we're confident in that, and we think we'll get clearance in due course. But we're working through the process with the various agencies right now.\nMike Sievert: We have begun some planning with the counterparties, particularly US Cellular and because that's a more complicated set of planning that we have to do. And we've met the teams, they're fired up. I can tell you that they are excited about that core premise that Mark just reminded everybody of. This is a -- and this isn't always the case. This is a transaction that very clearly will result in both lower prices and better network. Both T-Mobile and US Cellular customers will have a better network experience. There's no question about that. And US Cellular customers will be offered lower prices as they migrate to the T-Mobile plans. And that's just a classic win-win. So we are very confident, but we have to keep our heads down and go through the process and explain our case to all the parties involved. Very exciting time.\nSam McHugh : Great. Thank you.\nKathy Au: Thanks Sam. Our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays. Please go head. With your question.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe one on pricing. Mike, when you look at pricing across the industry right now, it just seems like it's taking much better than expected. I mean, churn is not as high when these price increases are taken, and we've seen multiple price increases, of course, from your peers. Does that make you think that the value gap is maybe bigger in wireless and maybe this becomes a recurring opportunity? And related to that, when you think about your volume growth, you're over-indexing versus the rest of the industry by a significant amount. And that's obviously great from a share perspective, but it does come with its own cost in the form of working capital and equipment margin rate and so on. So is it a third that if prices are making better, then maybe the balance can shift a little bit more towards price and drive the rest of the P&L and cash flow in a slightly different direction. Thanks.\nMike Sievert: That's a great question. Thanks for it. Our strategy here has been remarkably consistent. And as it relates to, for example, the working capital and other P&L impacts of a growth orientation, that's kind of very much in the run rate. It's true this quarter, we had the best Q3 in a decade, so that's on the margin, helpful. But it's in the same area code. I mean we're growing methodically, consistently, repeatedly, and that's what you want to see from us, as we chase these very ambitious goals for the out year. I will put our revenue growth plan up against anybody's. It -- our plan is one that favors customers that focuses on value that promises value and that has resulted in service revenue growth and postpaid service revenue growth that lead the industry by a wide margin. So I want to make sure to caution us because the strategy we have, which is to emphasize value and network and experience, as this team keeps reminding in every answer, that really works. And so we're very cautious about putting that at risk. That being said, we have to keep up with the times. You've seen us doing some of that. I think you could even be said that, that's gone very well. But we have to make sure that anything we do now and in the future is consistent with our vision that the Un-carrier stands for superior value. And to your premise of your question, that may leave room. What it means to be that may allow us to make changes over time, but we will make changes with the North Star being true to our brand should there be changes in the future.\nKathy Au: Thanks, Mike. Before we go to our last question on the phone, I'm going to take one question from social media probably for Peter. Given the nice EBITDA take-up for the year, can you help us understand what's driving that? Is it the rate increase? Or are there other puts and takes we should think about?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Kathy. There's a number of things. Of course, we're at that time of the year when the year guide is the Q4 guide. And so maybe I'll just focus on all the puts and takes within Q4. Of course, there's more adds for the year as we just raised guidance yet again on total postpaid as well as total postpaid phone. And then there is a few puts and takes as I think about, while the net is an increase in the midpoint. There is a non-cash spectrum swap gain as that deal has closed. That's about $137 million. But that is primarily offset by slightly higher ACP decline. So as I mentioned earlier, we'll be at the higher end of that $350 million to $450 million range. And then, of course, there's hurricane costs that we're incurring in Q4 to make sure that we get the network back up and running and serve customers as quickly as possible on that front. So with all those puts and takes, we still saw a nice increase of $50 million at the midpoint and I'm very excited about that.\nMike Sievert: Every guidance we give is fundamentally driven by the underpinnings of the business, right? And every quarter has sort of some tailwinds and some headwinds that are onetime, and this one is no different. Good one. Was that question from Kathy's birthday online or --.\nKathy Au: Okay. All right. Last question. Thanks, operator.\nOperator: Our last and final question comes from Eric Luebchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nEric Luebchow: Hi, great. Appreciate it, you squeeze me in. So I just wanted to maybe touch on the high speed HSI or fixed wireless business. Obviously, you updated your guide at Capital Markets Day [$12 million] (ph) aspiration. And I know we talked about it implies a modest decel in net adds if we straight line it, but you've been pretty consistent at this [400,000] (ph) quarterly run rate. So does that still feel like an achievable number near term? And maybe, any other color you could provide on kind of how gross adds versus churn have trended? And then any geographical split kind of between urban versus suburban versus rural areas where you rolled it out? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Sure. The majority come from cable. The majority come from -- with existing T-Mobile customers. The broad trend lines haven't changed much. As we grow, gross adds have to grow in order to outrun even if churn is consistent. Broadly, every quarter is different. But broadly over time, our churn trends have looked very nicely as this cohort has aged. So that's really good. Every quarter, we'll be a little different on that front. But generally, I've been pleased with that over the last 1.5 years. But gross adds have to keep rising. And so that's one of the reasons why there is a difference between the current run rate and the terminal size by 2028 \u201cat least for now\u201d. And we'll have to see how it goes. You're right. It's been remarkably consistent, consistent in that. We've been gaining more net adds than anyone else in the industry, some quarters more than everyone else combined. And one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence here is that people just love this product. This is the highest Net Promoter Score by some measures, product in the country. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. Our average speeds are just like the cable averages. Our usage is 0.5 gig or 0.5 terabyte a month and growing. The average speed and experience is triple what it was three years ago. So it's not a static thing. It's rapidly improving. And again, it matches cable, but it's a lot -- it's differentiated versus other fixed wireless offerings as well. So we're just really confident in the product, and we will keep investing time and energy in the customer experience to make sure it remains truly great. And so far, so good.\nKathy Au: Thank you, Mike. That's all the time we have for questions, and we appreciate everyone joining us today.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, everybody.\nKathy Au: We look forward to speaking to you again. And if you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or media departments. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile Third Quarter Earnings Call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Mike, and thanks everybody for joining us. As Mike highlighted, we delivered yet another fantastic quarter and are raising our guidance yet again. So let me provide a quick update on our expectations for 2024. Starting with customers, we are once again raising total postpaid customer net additions and now expect between $5.6 million and $5.8 million, up $150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the postpaid phone customer net additions component of that total to be approximately 3 million for the full year. We expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up around 3% year-over-year with industry-leading service revenue growth continuing to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.6 million and $31.8 billion for the full year, up $50 million at the midpoint. Turning to Cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.8 billion and $9 billion, unchanged at the midpoint. Our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we outlined for you at our Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago. And finally, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger-related costs to be in the range of $16.7 billion to $17 billion, up $50 million at the midpoint, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency, resulting in industry-leading service revenue to free cash flow conversion. In closing, when we spoke with you all a few weeks ago at Capital Markets Day, we outlined an ambitious plan of evolving from challenger to champion. One that requires consistently strong execution. Our Q3 results are another proof-point on that journey with our unique combination of the best value, best network, and best experiences, continuing to resonate with customers. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy? Yeah, thank you so much, Simon. You know, what happened, both on the Q2 call, we anticipated to be back in the marketplace, And we saw a similar dynamic happen after our Q2 call, as we saw before Q2. And that was our trading plan really didn't anticipate the faster than expected or earlier than expected run up in the share price. And what that meant for us is really, it gave us an opportunity after that happened a second time to step back and rethink strategically how we wanted to approach the buybacks. And we did that. And now you see something that's less informed by quick movements towards where we think it's going and more of a consistent execution. Still thoughtful of many factors. Of course, I can't get into all of those, but it's a little bit of a change in strategy. And that's what you saw happen after that strategic change. Since that point, we've been in the market place consistently. So that's the buyback story. And you know, on wholesale, much like I said, in 2025, what we expect is the trough of wholesale and other service revenue. And underpinning that though, there's actually growth in wholesale and our partnerships if you consider, as you mentioned, both the ACP decline, which we now expect to be towards the higher end of that [$350 million to $450 million] (ph) range that we gave previously. And of course, the long planned transition of TracFone away to Verizon, as they complete that merger integration. So the underlying dynamics are great when you take out the ACP and the TracFone. And that's what we expect as we hit that trough to continue to fuel growth past 2025. Yes, Dave, on the 3 million, so it's approximately 3 million from a postpaid phone perspective. And as you know, Q4 has a unique attribute in that the last couple of months, which are really in front of us here are a period of really great activity. We have certainly positioned well, as you saw in Q3. And of course, we have ambitions to outperform what we put there. But we're always cautious with the two biggest months of Q4 ahead of us, in terms of putting a guide out there that's achievable for us. So somewhere approximately in that 3 million, not right on with, of course, the ability and aspiration for us to get after it. Part 3, well, I'll definitely be truthful and redirect you to ARPA in just a second. But honestly, we do see strength there. And previously, what we had said is, from an ARPU perspective, we see probably about 0.5% year-over-year increase probably now see about 75 bps of that, so a little bit of strength there. But the reason we don't focus on ARPU as much as you know, is because it is very much a mix-driven metric. And so things like the success that Callie just described in the business group where you don't have high ARPUs, you tend to have lower ARPUs with higher ARPUs, very, very strong CLVs, segment plans, things like that. That's why we pivot into ARPA and again, continued strength there and just increased our guide very exciting to be at 3% year-over-year increase from an ARPA perspective. And maybe I would add just one little bit because of those dynamics that we're seeing what Mike described, as I think about Q4, we'll probably see the same seasonality from an equipment revenue perspective that we saw last year. So the same kind of absolute dollar increase that we saw Q3 to Q4 is, what I expect to happen from Q3 to this Q4. Obviously, higher than Q3 with that holiday seasonality happening there, but that's the trend that we'd expect. Yes. ARPA is a number of factors, as you know. On the consumer side, it's a continual expansion of the relationship, including with 5G home broadband, other connected devices, really seeing strength in growth and expansion of customer relationships. Callie spoke a lot about the success in T-Mobile for business across the segments and how you see ARPA expansion there. In terms of the rate plan optimization, that was a very minor component of the year-over-year ARPA change and certainly not the driver for the 3% increase now that we anticipated really is core expansion of customer relationships that's so exciting. Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Kathy. There's a number of things. Of course, we're at that time of the year when the year guide is the Q4 guide. And so maybe I'll just focus on all the puts and takes within Q4. Of course, there's more adds for the year as we just raised guidance yet again on total postpaid as well as total postpaid phone. And then there is a few puts and takes as I think about, while the net is an increase in the midpoint. There is a non-cash spectrum swap gain as that deal has closed. That's about $137 million. But that is primarily offset by slightly higher ACP decline. So as I mentioned earlier, we'll be at the higher end of that $350 million to $450 million range. And then, of course, there's hurricane costs that we're incurring in Q4 to make sure that we get the network back up and running and serve customers as quickly as possible on that front. So with all those puts and takes, we still saw a nice increase of $50 million at the midpoint and I'm very excited about that."

            "content": "Yes. Hi, Mike. So just smaller markets in rural areas, I always take a moment to remind everyone that this is 40% of the market, 140 million people, 50 million households. We could not be more pleased with the progression of our growth in this space. Q2 was our highest win share quarter that we've ever delivered. And here in Q3, we beat Q2. And so we've got a great series of momentum happening in the marketplace where we're driving switching, winning those switching decisions, Number #1 in terms of win share in the marketplace in smaller markets and rural areas. And like I talked about at Capital Markets Day, too, the thing that built a lot of confidence for me is that our overall Net Promoter Score in smaller markets and rural areas is now number one, and it's 20% higher than the next highest competitor. For me, that builds ongoing customer advocacy, customer loyalty and continues to build that overall growth momentum that we have in that particular marketplace. And that's why we're continuing to build net new accounts in the top 100 markets as well. So we're having a lot of fun doing this. I've been talking about it for three years, and we're continuing to drive new highs in our switching activity in smaller markets and rural areas."

            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yes. I mean in terms of the current upgrade rates, like you said they were low. And a lot of that is just because of what we've been talking about the last several quarters that we see customers having their natural demand met by virtue of the way that our upgrade programs work. And by virtue of how good the T-Mobile version of the 5G devices are, both in terms of penetration, we have over 80% of our customers using 5G devices. But also -- and maybe Ulf can comment on this later, some of the unique capabilities that are available in some of these devices because of our stand-alone 5G network. So what we see is customers having devices that generally work better and devices that are becoming more expensive and lasting longer. And we think all those factors have come into play affecting and you are seeing the outcomes of the upgrade rates. Looking forward, look, it is hard to predict. A lot of the OEMs don't share their long-term plans and what their devices are going to look like next year. But like -- just like going into this iPhone cycle, I'd say the next -- the same thing about next year's cycles, both with iPhone and with other OEMs. We think we're really well positioned on whether it's a big upgrade cycle or not. In the case of a big upgrade cycle, T-Mobile has constantly been the winner when there's a lot of switching in the marketplace. And we saw that again during this last iPhone launch, and it's demonstrated in a lot of the results that you saw here in Q3 with 315,000 net new accounts by far, the most out of anybody that reports in this industry. So we think in a world where there is a lot of switching because of a new device that creates a lot of upgrades because of this unique proposition of best network, best value and best experience when customers are shopping, T-Mobile is going to win. And that's, I think been demonstrated quarter-over-quarter for many years now. Yeah. We have several transactions. And I would say all of them are in the process and the processes are going really well. In terms of Lumos, we expect that to close in the first -- the first part of next year. US Cellular, which is also in the process, maybe the middle part of next year. And then Metronet, we also expect to close in 2025. So good progress through the whole regulatory process. There's obviously several different groups that have to review and approve them and feel like those are going really well so far."

            "content": "Okay. We'll do. Well, Jon mentioned that they're having a lot of fun. And I got to tell you, so is this TFB team. We beat our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone net adds in postpaid net adds and invoice churn. We're continuing to see profitable growth, rising CLVs in all segments. And we also just declared our ninth consecutive quarter of positive [port trends] (ph) in all segments against our competitors. In enterprise, let me narrow in specifically on a couple of the segments and some customer wins and use cases. Enterprise, we had our best activations on record. So considerable growth across all of our solutions and working with existing customers like American Airlines, where we're developing BTS solutions for their airplane operations or new logo growth with New York Life Insurance, where we are helping them combine solution with Smarsh, to make sure that their voice communications are secure. In government, we saw double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter and net adds across phone, BTS and in HSI. And a lot of that growth is supported by wins in the Fed via the Spiral 4 contract. So we are growing and winning with the Army, the Air Force and the Y-12 National Security complex. And then when I think about HSI in particular, this is one of our strongest quarters ever, highest net adds in fixed wireless. And we're doing really well. So we saw a lot of wins this quarter with retail multisite. So new customers include Lowe's, Spirit Halloween, PetSmart and then in education, where we're able to solve some connectivity problems with some of the largest school districts in the country like Houston ISD. And then again, like I mentioned before, bringing our fixed wireless solutions to the Department of Defense. And we certainly have more room to run. With [A&S] (ph), we had some really cool deployments this year. We're starting with advanced network solutions to really see our pipeline continue to grow and then continuing to see more and more deals closed each quarter, which the team is working hard against that target. Oxy Petroleum is an example, Chetan to answer your question online, where we deployed a hybrid A&S solution across of 20 of their manufacturing plants. And so that's some of the work that we've been doing this last quarter, part 3. I'll hand it to Part 3."

            "name": "Ulf Ewaldsson",
            "content": "Right. Well, thanks, Mike. Well, on our journey, when we are building our network, which is a dense 5G multilayer network. We are always working with our different layers and the different spectrum assets we have. We have a superior sub-6 gigahertz holding, today which is providing us with our enormous capacity benefit. And in that, we always value spectrum short-term, long-term and mid-term. And we see that 3.45 is not part of this plan. So that's why we did it. Then this transaction goes through a number of different approvals and so on, and we will see. But the way we did it, we are very satisfied, I could say, with how it came out. On the 800 band, we concluded the auction without really a bid that was qualifying. That gives us now new optionality really. We can either deploy it or we could look at doing something to benefit monetarily from it. So we have those optionalities as we go forward. We're always working on our spectrum portfolio and continue to build this leading 5G network based on it. Well, the only comment there on the phones that Mike mentioned is that many phones are coming up and getting 2-carrier aggregation, 2-carrier aggregation in the uplink. This gives enormous benefits. It's 30% higher speeds in the downlink, 15% in the uplink. So this stuff performs really well on our network. And just a reminder on what Mike brought up is that we are the only one who has pure stand-alone core. We've had it since 2020. It's well tuned. It's rolled out over entire network, and it allows us to do these things. It allows us to the 4-carrier in the downlink, it allows us for the 2-carrier in the uplink with all those benefits for the new devices coming out. And it also allows us now to use voice over the new air interface as you mentioned in your opening, that's a huge thing. It really leads to much better call setup times. It leads to better quality, and it gives us the opportunity for more effective spectrum use. Right. And first of all, I mean, we have the greatest assets, as I said before, on the below 6 gigahertz those assets are allowing us to build a very consistent network. So means that also all the towers that we have and we have more than 80% of our towers are equipped very similarly. We are the only player in the market who has three layers dedicated to 5G. In that, when we are allowing us to build and expand this, we are using a methodology that we call customer-driven coverage. And customer-driven coverage is something we have spent about 1.5 years about developing a methodology. It's an algorithmic [etiology] (ph) based on AI where we're using billions and billions of data points that we are assessing from customer experience data across the network. We're correlating that with business data and with real customer outcomes. In other words, what customers decide to do on our network. And then we are assigning a CLV value, a customer lifetime value to a grid across the country, more than 4 million little hexagons that we have created across the country, 165 meter-wide hexagons. We are signing those values relative to competition to allow us to know exactly where we can build to please customers. Because at the end of the day, this is not a pop drive where you're just chasing populations and where populations live, it's a much more complicated art to figure out exactly where customers will value most our build. And that's what we're doing on our capital allocation. And to answer your question, Jim. It's really what we're doing on our capital allocation for next year. We're taking full advantage of our customer-driven coverage. Now looking then at our assets and our -- to your question about the 3 gigahertz band. How much do we really need to deploy that? Well, today, we have a -- and we went very smart into the auction around C-band, where we selected 50 markets where we really could see that this spectrum fits very well to our grid. So when we deploy it, it will be optimized for our grid, our tower-to-tower distance in a way that makes it very effective. And it's very -- in markets where there could potentially over time, be a need to expand our capacity. But as we see it now, it is not needed. We have so much more room to run. We are only about 60% deployed on our mid-band spectrum to 5G today. And we have much more other things that we can take an action in among the others, the technology leadership that you just explained, Mike. So that's where we are on our C-band plan."

They're still pending for the FCC, and that will take a little more time, as Mike just indicated, on U.S. Cellular. We think this is great for consumers. It's going to lead to lower pricing, especially for the US cellular customers. It's going to lead to better coverage for all customers. So we're confident in that, and we think we'll get clearance in due course. But we're working through the process with the various agencies right now."

            "content": "OK, thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the Q3 call. We're coming to you from Bellevue today, and I'm joined by several members of our senior leadership team to talk about another outstanding quarter for T-Mobile. Now, given our recent Capital Markets Day, Peter and I are going to keep our remarks pretty light so that we can get right to your questions. And before I get into our quarter, I do want to take a moment to recognize our team for their hard work around the clock to help our customers, fellow employees, and communities to get back on their feet in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton. It was devastating to have back-to-back storms of this scale form in such rapid succession, but I am so proud of how our team showed up. From readiness to recovery, their tireless efforts and use of innovative technologies made a huge difference in affected communities. Okay, turning to the quarter. In short, it was a really strong one. In fact, Q3 is an example of the consistent execution we talked about a few weeks ago as a core enabler of our bold multi-year plan. As you know, achieving that plan is predicated on delivering strong results reliably and repeatedly to keep pace with our ambition. And we did just that in Q3, empowering us to raise our 2024 guidance yet again. I'll start with our mobile business. We delivered the best Q3 postpaid phone net adds in a decade, fueled by record low Q3 postpaid phone churn and continued year-over-year growth in gross adds. We also continued to lead the industry in share of switchers, and we grew share of households in both top 100 and smaller markets and rural areas. Our powerful combination of our best network, best value, and best customer experience continues to be a winning formula. We believe we have lots of room to run in our underpenetrated areas and segments, including among those who shop primarily on network attributes all across this country. Now, you heard us lay down some pretty audacious digitalization goals at our Capital Markets Day event, and we're making steady progress. I'm proud to share that our total digital mix of iPhone launch sales in Q3 is up 40% just year-over-year, and that for the first time the majority of T-Mobile branded iPhone pre-orders this year were digital. This highlights the early progress we've already begun to make in further simplifying and digitalizing and transforming the customer buying experience, and it validates the appetite our customers have for buying online, when they are given the option for a more seamless process. Our customer momentum also continues in broadband, where we delivered industry-leading net adds once again and reached a major milestone of 6 million customers in just three years. We're now halfway to our long-term target of 12 million customers by 2028. Our performance is fueled by our leading 5G network, which was recently awarded once again as having the best 5G availability in the world by Opensignal. And our industry-leading technology will continue to further differentiate us, as more and more new handsets come into the marketplace that can take advantage of our new technologies like voiceover new radio, our incredible four-way carrier aggregation technology, and so many other things. Across the board, our team is doing awesome work to further extend our 5G network leadership, for the benefit of customers. And they're noticing the superior speed, capacity, and consistency relative to our competition. Okay, moving on to our financials. In Q3, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable customer growth, which we translated to industry-leading service revenue growth, including year-over-year post-paid service revenue growth about 2 times that of peers, driven by our highest ARPA growth in seven years, as we continue to deepen customer relationships. Our core adjusted EBITDA growth of 9% led the industry by a wide margin. That combined with our unparalleled capital efficiency led once again to industry leading free cash flow conversion. I said I'd keep it brief, so let me sum it up. Our formula for generating outsized value creation from focusing on smart and profitable growth continues to work really well. We have lots of runway ahead of us to continue to deliver profitable industry leading growth as we drive forward on the ambitious plan we shared with you last month. Okay, Peter, over to you to provide an update on our guidance, please. I think, Simon. First of all, I'll hand it to Peter for both those questions. But first of all, I just want to say congratulations to you on your retirement and thank you -- first of all, for keeping us all honest. But I also know that investors have hung on your every word for many years, and you've served them so well. So we're all going to miss you. And I thought maybe your last question would be a softball. But instead, come on, Peter. What happened with those buybacks? You don't ever disappoint there, Simon. You bet. Okay. Well, let's do the digitalization one first, John. If you recall at Capital Markets Day, we laid out a pretty ambitious plan for value creation over the years. And Signal Day 2027 core adjusted EBITDA, about $10 billion at the high point of our guidance above 2023 levels. And so that kind of shows you the potential. Now a lot of that's revenue growth, which is partly driven by digitalization. And a lot of that is recrafting the underlying operation, getting more precise in our marketing, preventing customer problems that are a source of so much value loss in this industry. And so we didn't unpack all the details of which parts to drive which parts. But I can tell you that we arrived at that plan after working on it for almost two years. And after detailing out a 14-quarter quarter-by-quarter detailed plan of what will land when. So that we have the barometers of knowing if we're running ahead of our plan that we can increase our promises to you. If it looks like we're going to be running behind, we can course correct, that's how we do these things. And if you go back to our 2021 plans when a lot of people thought what we said back then was unbelievably ambitious, and we did it. But we did it because we had a detailed plan. We don't always provide a lot of transparency. I think we do a good job there. We provide more than others on transparency, but we also have to keep some of the secret sauce to ourselves for competitive reasons. To make sure you saw the barometers underneath that, though, we put some markers out there. We said we wanted person-to-person customer service interactions to be reduced by 75% in the planning horizon. That's a big marker. We said we wanted the majority of all activations to be digital and many other markers that we put out there. And one of the things that Peter said was that the actual business plan that we laid out didn't assume full achievement of each of those KPIs. So in a world where we deliver each and every one of those KPIs, there is upside beyond the guidance range. And so we try to put out a plan that's realistic, but at the same time, ambitious. And that's kind of what we mean by Challenger to Champion. It's a plan for the future that's an evolution from Challenger to Champion that really causes us to have to do things that nobody's ever done and really rethink how this industry works, as you see us doing in so many ways. And hopefully, that came across well at Capital Markets Day. Now switching to spectrum. You asked a couple of different questions. One of them was about 3.45 specifically, and I'll just ask Ulf to talk about what's going on there. Hope that answer the question, John. Okay. Well, I'll start, Dave. And I'm sorry to disappoint you without being able to really answer the question much. I guess the prototypical answer would be, you kind of have to ask them. I will say that in this long journey, being an independent company with DT, as our controlling shareholder. We've seen their position range from the 40s to the mid-60s. They've maintained controlling stake the entire time, and that governance structure for us, from our lens has been pretty unchanged. In other words, the Board structure the people involved. We have all been together a long time. At this point, TMUS is a very, very important part of what they do, and they're very clear about that. We're much larger as a company than they are now, et cetera. And I think from a standpoint of governance, it really works. What's good for us is generally good for them, especially because of the relative value and size, et cetera. They've been incredibly supportive of our strategy. They're a great Board, I feel that having industry experts on our Board from DT has been very helpful to us. I think a lot of companies in our space don't have that benefit of insiders that are really able to ask the three layers of whys on all the things we want to do. And at the end of the day, this management team and this Board have made a lot of moves together that have created enormous value and success. Now they did mention that they wanted to -- they have multiple strategies and multiple capital allocation strategies that may result in them concentrating their position over time. But how -- when that happens, how that happens, whether that happens, you'll have to ask them. As to your second question? I will say, while we're teeing up the neck, we almost always get that question at this time of the year -- and because it's weird to have a guy with only two months left. But you also have to remember that the biggest part of the quarter is the part that's still in front of us. So every year at this time, and we do get accused of being a little cautious. I don't think it's cautious. It's just that so much is unfolding later in the quarter. I will comment that our quarter-to-date trends are spot on our plan and looking really strong. So no question marks there whatsoever. Okay. It turns out to be a three-part question. So I'm going to ask three different speakers to try to keep it tight. But we're going to go to Jon on SMRA, quickly to [Callie on] (ph) business and then back to Peter on ARPU, and I'm going to predict he's going to pivot you to ARPA. But, Jon? And I know you didn't ask out this, Mike, but one of the things we reminded you of at the Capital Markets Day is we deaverage that top 100 set of markets for you a little bit. And this dynamic that Jon is talking about that has been a huge tailwind for us in SMRA is present in a lot of those top 100 markets. There's a big part of those. Well, we're not Number #1, and some of them were not even #2. And so there's big tailwind potential there. And in all 3 types, where we're #1, where we're #2 or even while we're #3, T-Mobile is growing. So it really shows that our formula works across the board. And now to the second part of your three-part question, what's going on with the business. And by the way, Callie, while you're talking about that, maybe you could hit Chetan Sharma's question about enterprise solution deals, what are we seeing? Could you name names, what's going on out there? Great. Thanks. Well done. And ARPU trying to --. Okay. Great. Well, I'll start out on -- I guess, on both of them and then see if Ulf wants to add anything. On the direct-to-sell, there -- no, we don't really see any barriers to progress there. We're very much looking forward to getting our beta underway during the hurricanes, we were able to test with a temporary authorization and saw hundreds of thousands of successfully completed text messages to people that otherwise wouldn't have seen them even though our network was recovered at a remarkable pace. And so it's just -- it's getting closer and closer. We have over 200 satellites in the air. I think this will work itself out despite the obvious process that has to happen through the FCC. I think this is a fundamental good and we will be off to the races very soon. As it relates to 800, as Ulf said, there's a lot of optionality for 800 now. We were required to sell it as an artifact of the merger and the consent decree and to auction it under a set of auction rules. We did that and there wasn't a qualifying bid as defined in the consent decree. And so we're no longer are required to sell it. That gives us optionality. I'll remind you of a few things that Peter has said, one, proceeds from selling it are not currently in our financial plan. So should we sell that spectrum, that will be, in essence, incremental. And secondly, in Ulf's network plan, utilizing that spectrum is not currently in the plan. So the reason I point this out is that just we have a lot of optionality and that's valuable spectrum. It's important spectrum. And you'll have to stay tuned as it relates to our resolution on how we plan to use it. As it relates to fiber and open fiber, one of the things that has made cable kind of interesting is that you do see a certain amount of collaboration in that space because there aren't overlaps. Look, it's hard to predict what the future will look like. This is a very, very competitive market. I think it always will be very, very competitive. And that being said, a lot of things will unfold over the years, and we'll have to see what's the very best way we can serve consumers and businesses. But we're open-minded to all future constructs. I can tell you that we are very, very excited about our fiber plans, and we intend to compete vigorously with them. Our strategy is to be first to fiber in the places where we go and that's why we teamed up with some of the fastest moving players in this industry, so that we can race with abandon to provide this incredible service we know we can provide. That being said, I wouldn't speculate more on the future than that. Yes. Happy birthday, Cathy. Yes, a great set of questions, Craig. Why don't we start with Mike Katz and talk about the upgrade rates we're seeing and little future casting? Okay. Anybody want to add to that? So it is interesting, why do we say these things? Well, first of all, we pointed out for the reason Mike said, which is when people are having a fantastic experience that's differentiated with their current device at T-Mobile, then they are not as compelled to move. They're having a great experience, so they shop less. That's great. We have low upgrade rates as a result. When they wind up switching, we win because we win the switching moment. So there's not enough talking in this industry about switching, but it's very clear that these numbers show once again we're the switching winner. And if there's a super cycle in the future and that spurs switching that will be great for us. And this point that Ulf that you're pointing out around the newer devices, taking advantage of our advanced capabilities, it really speaks to another issue. At Capital Markets Day, we were pretty clear that we don't expect to just defend this 5G network lead. We expect to extend it over time. And the evidence continues to back us up on that. We are much -- our margin of superiority is greater today than it was two years ago. And one of the drivers of this is not just the rate and pace of our deploying technologies but it's the tailwind represented by the fact that a lot of the devices out there today in people's hands don't take full advantage of the network. For example, the latest iPhone 16 has advanced capabilities that are uniquely unlocked by T-Mobile's network. And the more those get in people's hands, the more it will unlock the embedded technology we've already rolled out, creating a tailwind for us to further extend our lead. And that will be a great dynamic down the road when people have those in their hands and they're faced later with weather to upgrade further and they're going to be very happy with what they have. So really nice trends unfolding there. Hope that helps, Craig? Thanks, Jim. This might be a good opportunity for Ulf to kind of remind that we have a different approach for how to do this than many. And it's algorithmic, it's driven by deep data. And in that sense, the planfulness around big macro topics like that are a little bit different for us. In other words, we're looking now at a much more micro level than kind of a broad secular level without as much preference for whether it is rural or whether it's urban et cetera, but maybe you can explain customer-driven coverage and how it drives our priorities into 2025. Perfect. So Jim, what you can take away from that are a couple of things. One is with apologies. What you can take away is what you just heard. We keep a little close to the vest. How and when we will deploy each band and exactly where we will deploy. And we do that for all kinds of reasons. But one of the transparency we attempt to offer you is the following: One, we outlooked at Capital Markets Day that the $9 billion to $10 billion capital envelope is sufficient with our detailed planning to not only defend but to extend our 5G leadership and to meet the goals that we established in our business plan. We've modeled this at a very detailed level. The way -- the lens is different. The set of tools are different. They're not blunt tools like let's go after the countryside and let's go after -- it's much more algorithmic, both just described that we have tens of thousands of projects. They might be small upgrades, they might be reorientations, they might be adding C-band in the future to the premise of your question. We have tens of thousands of future projects that gets stacked-ranked based on some practical concerns like zoning permitting but mostly based on the outputs from our AI-driven algorithic model called customer-driven coverage. And the result of that will be that we will stay ahead of the demand curve and continue to extend our overall performance and 5G experience leadership in the country within the CapEx envelope that we provided to you. Okay. And again, I'm going to apologize. I feel like you've asked me two in a row that I'm not all that well equipped to answer. And the reason why the second one is difficult is that we have sort of determined that T-Mobile or maybe even our industry writ large, is not really that great of a canary in the coal mine on macroeconomic things. And part of that is, I think, the essential nature of our service. And so we are not going to be the guys to ask to give you early indicators of changes or nuances and consumer behavior. And one of the -- and that's borne out by our numbers. Our customers are kind of per category, per segment paying at traditional norms, valuing the service, just no real secular changes there -- that are noteworthy. As it relates to growth in the industry, there are weird dynamics that are hard to predict there. We've done a pretty good job predicting our business, almost remarkably good job predicting our business. But predicting what happens sort of in the \"market growth\u201d has been more difficult. And a lot of that is because some of what gets added to the industry is kind of questionable sort of lower calorie net adds, et cetera. And it's one of the reasons why we focus so much on switching. We focus on the core business, our families on postpaid traditional plans who've been in this industry for a while and who switched to us from another provider, that continues to be just sort of at a modest rate and pace, the bread and butter of our superior revenue growth story. The other dynamic we focus on is an ongoing transference from prepaid to postpaid. Now this one could possibly be a canary in the coal mine you're looking for because we have seen over the past five years during these vibrant economic times, lots of transference from prepaid to postpaid. In this most recent quarter, we saw it yet again a strong -- I think it was 175,000 net transfers from our prepaid to our postpaid showing that, that trend just continues that one -- maybe that one would be an indicator if you see that slowdown because this is a demonstration that customers are qualifying for postpaid plans over these last five years. So that's one to watch and it continues to be in recent trends in recent history consistent with. Okay, you bet. Well, it's a great question, Peter, and it's -- the premise of your question acknowledges this, it's a little premature. But there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the long-term trends. And that's one of the reasons why we wanted to talk with you at our Capital Markets Day about our vision for what comes after this current 5G cycle. AI-RAN and what it can be. And yes, there's a potential big cycle coming. But on the other hand, it may be a cycle that's fundamentally more efficient to roll out than prior cycles. And the promises of Open RAN that have been made for years may finally be realized at scale in the AI RAN era. And this allows you to offset potential future cost of replacement of future technologies with fundamental efficiency, and so we're optimistic. We were able to indicate that for our planning horizon over the next few years, this $9 billion to $10 billion CapEx area makes sense. Now that's not full-scale 6G time frames yet. But at the same time, we wanted to put down markers about our vision for what comes next with AI brand because it's so promising on the ability to do more. One of the things that we drive our plan around is the two core metrics, which is technology over time should allow us to extract more and more network performance per CapEx and OpEx dollar and it should allow us to extract more and more network performance per unit of spectrum. And that's what has happened, and that's what we think will continue to happen. But this next cycle may be more efficient than the big verticalized 5G cycle was. I will also say that the net cost of 5G involved a big part of that cost involved our competitors rushing in to spend an inordinate amount of money to try to get mid-band spectrum and that was caused by the extra competition brought on by our merger. Had that unfolded differently, it may have happened over time. And it really showcases how much competition our merger brought to this industry and how quickly. And today, customers are the beneficiaries of that. But so is the industry. One of the things I've talked about in the past is that yet while 5G has been costly for some, overall, you see industry cash flows at or around all-time highs. And yet you see consumers benefiting with 3 times to 4 times more speed and 3 times to 4 times more data usage at similar price points to 5 or 6 years ago. So consumers are -- are giant winners from the 5G cycle, but the industry remains quite healthy as well. And I think the future bodes very nicely for 6G. One of the things we intend, like we did in 5G, when we looked around corners, and we saw that it would unfold on smartphones and in mid-band, we intend to be a company that drives the future on 6G as well. And that's why we've struck our unique partnership with Ericsson, Nokia and NVIDIA to help invent AI- RAN and bring the future about in a way that disproportionately benefits T-Mobile customers. Okay. I'm going to start with Peter on ARPU and ARPA. And is it mix driven? Or what's it driven by and then probably turn to Mike Katz to talk about how US Cellular is unfolding? Okay. And maybe while you're at it Mike, you can talk about not just US Cellular, but you might as well talk about Metronet and Lumos. We've been pretty busy out there. So what's going on with these new combinations that we have? We happen to have at the end of the table, one of the nation's most accomplished antitrust layers. So our General Counsel, Mark Nelson, any commentary on things we're learning as we go along. We have begun some planning with the counterparties, particularly US Cellular and because that's a more complicated set of planning that we have to do. And we've met the teams, they're fired up. I can tell you that they are excited about that core premise that Mark just reminded everybody of. This is a -- and this isn't always the case. This is a transaction that very clearly will result in both lower prices and better network. Both T-Mobile and US Cellular customers will have a better network experience. There's no question about that. And US Cellular customers will be offered lower prices as they migrate to the T-Mobile plans. And that's just a classic win-win. So we are very confident, but we have to keep our heads down and go through the process and explain our case to all the parties involved. Very exciting time. That's a great question. Thanks for it. Our strategy here has been remarkably consistent. And as it relates to, for example, the working capital and other P&L impacts of a growth orientation, that's kind of very much in the run rate. It's true this quarter, we had the best Q3 in a decade, so that's on the margin, helpful. But it's in the same area code. I mean we're growing methodically, consistently, repeatedly, and that's what you want to see from us, as we chase these very ambitious goals for the out year. I will put our revenue growth plan up against anybody's. It -- our plan is one that favors customers that focuses on value that promises value and that has resulted in service revenue growth and postpaid service revenue growth that lead the industry by a wide margin. So I want to make sure to caution us because the strategy we have, which is to emphasize value and network and experience, as this team keeps reminding in every answer, that really works. And so we're very cautious about putting that at risk. That being said, we have to keep up with the times. You've seen us doing some of that. I think you could even be said that, that's gone very well. But we have to make sure that anything we do now and in the future is consistent with our vision that the Un-carrier stands for superior value. And to your premise of your question, that may leave room. What it means to be that may allow us to make changes over time, but we will make changes with the North Star being true to our brand should there be changes in the future. Every guidance we give is fundamentally driven by the underpinnings of the business, right? And every quarter has sort of some tailwinds and some headwinds that are onetime, and this one is no different. Good one. Was that question from Kathy's birthday online or --. Sure. The majority come from cable. The majority come from -- with existing T-Mobile customers. The broad trend lines haven't changed much. As we grow, gross adds have to grow in order to outrun even if churn is consistent. Broadly, every quarter is different. But broadly over time, our churn trends have looked very nicely as this cohort has aged. So that's really good. Every quarter, we'll be a little different on that front. But generally, I've been pleased with that over the last 1.5 years. But gross adds have to keep rising. And so that's one of the reasons why there is a difference between the current run rate and the terminal size by 2028 \u201cat least for now\u201d. And we'll have to see how it goes. You're right. It's been remarkably consistent, consistent in that. We've been gaining more net adds than anyone else in the industry, some quarters more than everyone else combined. And one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence here is that people just love this product. This is the highest Net Promoter Score by some measures, product in the country. And so that gives us a lot of confidence. Our average speeds are just like the cable averages. Our usage is 0.5 gig or 0.5 terabyte a month and growing. The average speed and experience is triple what it was three years ago. So it's not a static thing. It's rapidly improving. And again, it matches cable, but it's a lot -- it's differentiated versus other fixed wireless offerings as well. So we're just really confident in the product, and we will keep investing time and energy in the customer experience to make sure it remains truly great. And so far, so good. Thanks, everybody."

[Operator Instructions] You may also submit a question via X by sending a post to @TMobileIR or @MikeSievert using the $TMUS. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathy Au, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead.\nKathy Au : Good morning. Welcome to T-Mobile's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; and as well as other members of the senior leadership team. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of Risk Factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results, as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in the Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn it over to Mike.\nMike Sievert: Thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. We're coming to you from New York today. If you're watching online, you can see I'm with several members of the senior team ready to discuss these strong quarterly results and our recent news, and of course to take your questions. This T-Mobile team just continues to demonstrate strong execution across the board. We're taking up our customer growth and cash flow guidance for the full year once again. I'm going to begin with a comment on customer growth because this quarter not only represented our highest ever Q2 postpaid phone net ads in company history, but we also pushed past a major milestone, 100 million customer connections. This growth was once again balanced geographically across both smaller markets in rural areas and top 100 markets. We also grew our postpaid phone gross ads at the highest rate in nearly three years. At the same time, we delivered yet another, record low upgrade rate this quarter, speaking to the strength of our customers' experience on our differentiated 5G network. Speaking of experience, let me now turn to that network leadership. We swept every category for overall network performance in the latest Opensignal and Ookla tests. According to Opensignal, T-Mobile's download speeds are up to three times as fast as peers, alongside having nearly six times the 5G availability as our next closest competitor. Our network was also awarded the most consistent by both independent third parties, a key indicator of an overall superior network experience. We continue to invest thoughtfully and in a highly capital-efficient model to extend our network leadership, and it shows. It is really a privilege to see our team's hard work show up in recognition like this and to share it with you. Okay, turning to broadband. Our fixed wireless offering continues to resonate with customers, leading us to capture a record share of industry broadband net ads this quarter. And now we have an incredible 5.6 million fixed wireless broadband customers. I hope you all saw our news from last week, as I'm excited to talk to you about our partnership with KKR to acquire Metronet. The Metronet team is the nation's fastest growing pure play fiber provider. This is a unique company and asset. They already reach over 2 million homes today, and with this partnership are expected to grow to 6.5 million homes passed by 2030, bringing consumers greater choice where they need it most, and we are equally excited to work alongside KKR's expert infrastructure team on this project. As with our Lumos JV, T-Mobile will leverage our scale, brand, distribution, and existing customer relationships to grow faster and to do it smarter. I can't highlight enough how both the Metronet and Lumos JVs represent best in class partnerships in the fiber space. Because of the partners that we've chosen and T-Mobile's unique assets and capabilities, I believe this is going to be a very successful initiative for our shareholders. Now going back to the current business and our financials. In Q2, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth in customers and translating that to industry-leading service revenue growth and industry-leading core adjusted EBITDA growth. That, combined with our capital efficiency, has led to a record adjusted free cash flow quarter that grew 54% year-over-year and once again led the major wireless companies in free cash flow margins. I could not be more proud of this team's results this quarter. Okay, to sum it all up, we are staying true to our Un-carrier DNA while focusing on smart and profitable growth, delivering record financial results. Our durable and differentiated model continues to outperform and I look forward to sharing more about the Un-carrier's next chapter on value creation at our Capital Markets Day, which will be in the second half of September. We're going to get that on your calendars very soon. So Peter, let's hand it to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance.\nPeter Osvaldik : Thank you very much, Mike. As you can see, we delivered yet another strong quarter. Mike already highlighted the momentum in our wireless and broadband business as well as our impressive financial results. But, before turning to our outlook, I wanted to briefly touch on our acquisition of Mint Mobile and Ultra on May 1st. We couldn't be more excited for them to join Team Magenta. From a financial perspective, the acquisition resulted in a one-time prepaid base adjustment of approximately 3.5 million customers. Subsequent to the close, the incorporation of Mint and Ultra also resulted in approximately $100 million in net additional service revenue relative to Q1, which is net of the reduction in wholesale revenues and also resulted in a small benefit to core EBITDA as the revenue was largely offset with SG&A expenses as we made additional investments into the business to drive customer growth. All right, let me shift to an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2024. Starting with customers, we are excited to raise our total postpaid customer net additions to now be between 5.4 million and 5.7 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the total postpaid phone net customer additions component to be approximately half of our total postpaid additions, up from our expectations last quarter, and as part of that, we anticipate normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trends in the second half, as we saw a year ago. We continue to expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up to 3% higher year-over-year, and our industry leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect our core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.5 billion and $31.8 billion for the full year unchanged at the midpoint, which is up 9% year-over-year. This includes our latest estimate on the impact of ACP, as well as funding our higher postpaid customer guide. On ACP, we now expect the year-over-year impact to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million, driven primarily by what we're seeing at some of our wholesale providers. Okay, turning to cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion as we continue to invest and lead in network performance with unmatched capital efficiency. While our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we discussed before, 2024 is a bit lower given certain capital efficient network activities such as spectrum refarming and deploying additional 2.5 gigahertz licenses from auction 108, benefiting from the significant 5G radio deployments during our merger integration. We would expect Q3 to be the low water mark for the year before we accelerating in Q4 with more site upgrades and build activity. Lastly, we now expect the adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $16.6 billion to $17 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and up 24% year-over-year, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency and translating to an industry-leading service revenue to adjusted free cash flow margin. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter and expect another year of durable and differentiated growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry. We are looking forward to sharing more on our multi-year plans to continue to unlock shareholder value at Capital Markets Day this fall. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy.\nA - Kathy Au: All right, let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please.\nOperator: The first question today comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Good morning, guys. Can we talk a little bit about the fiber strategy? I mean, obviously, you guys have two big deals you announced and a number of other partnerships. Should we expect more deals sort of similar to what we saw with Lumos and Metronet? Then can you give us any color on what you've seen in some of your pilot markets in terms of penetration rates and maybe the benefits of convergence, both in terms of matching broadband and wireless and what that does to maybe your wireless penetration in those markets? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Yeah, John. Sure, let me start. I'll just ask the team to jump in. First of all, we're just really excited about where we are. This was a terrific transaction for us to be able to partner with KKR to acquire Metronet on top of our previous transaction to partner to acquire Lumos. So, now we have the beginnings of a critical mass in the space. For me, this is big. I mean, these two transactions taken together with our partnerships in the wholesale arena are going to allow us to reach millions of homes. The Lumos transaction, we see 3.5 million homes passed by 2028. The Metronet transaction, we see 6.5 million homes passed by 2030. There's probably a couple more million in the wholesale partnerships we have so far. So, that's a pretty significant footprint that we put together. More importantly, we've chosen the best assets in the space. We're very excited about this. Now, to the premise of your question, I think what people can see from our strategy are a number of things. One, our bias is pure play fiber, the simplicity and elegance of that model. It's doing it with partners so that we can get more leverage on our equity dollars. It's about best in class assets that are performing and growing like we're seeing. We have some further appetite, but not much. I want to make that clear. I mean, these transactions that we have done get us millions of homes past and do it in a way that we think is really smart and positive for our shareholders. So, while we're open-minded to things that fit this strategy, it would have to be the right deal. Our appetite is somewhat limited for more. I can tell you we're not currently working on another transaction like this, and since they've been coming every month or two, I want to make that clear as well. But we're really excited about this. This is a chance for us to make a big impact in the space and to do it with teams that are already the best in class out there. So that's that piece. The second you asked about performance. We can talk about our pilot markets. Those are going well. They're earlier in phasing. So, it's hard to see, but absolutely on track. To me, what's more interesting is looking at the performance of these already in-market teams that we are now going to be partnering with. Like Metronet, we see penetrations in the upper 30s and they're more mature markets because they already passed over 2 million homes. So, we can see at more scale how that asset's performing. Now, our thesis has always been that our brand and our distribution, our embedded customer base and our know-how can actually add performance to a partner like that in a very cost-effective way. But it's on top of a team that's performing very, very well.\nJohn Hodulik : Got it. Thanks Mike.\nMike Sievert: You bet.\nKathy Au: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery : Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for the disclosure on ACP. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on how that flows through. How much of that $350 million to $450 million was in Q2 and that impacts into Q3 and beyond? Then have you seen any benefit in terms of winning customers, say, in the Metro brand or anything like that? Then, Peter, you talked about the expectations for churn, and so for the second half of the year, what are you assuming in terms of an iPhone cycle? There's obviously a lot of excitement about an AI iPhone, given where your customers are, another load up, a great quarter. Do you think we're waiting for a bigger surge or do you think this will be looking fairly similar to last year, which is, I think, what you said? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: So, Peter, I'll turn to you on the ACP question and maybe I'll comment on the upcoming cycle.\nPeter Osvaldik: Okay. Yeah, and thanks, Simon. As you know, and just as a little bit of a history lesson for us, is we didn't participate in ACP through our postpaid brand. So there were no subscribers added there, and through Metro, we had a very small amount of customers. We primarily serve these customers through our Assurance brand, which didn't include subscriber counts and through supporting our wholesale partners. If I think about the arc of the $350 million to $450 million impact, given, of course ACP was still in play in Q1 and partially in Q2, I\u2019d see the majority of that impact happening in the second half and even more of it in Q4 than Q3, because still a little bit of a tail coming in Q3. So, that's the best view. Primarily the majority of that, again, is going to be in wholesale and other service revenues. I'd expect Q4 to be probably the biggest impact there.\nMike Sievert: Simon, our prepaid nets of 179,000 were the best quarter we've posted in years. Part of that is obviously joining with Mint and Ultra. But part of that is that we have a fantastic portfolio of brands that meet the needs of value consumers. To the premise of your question, this is a year when value consumers, because of these changes, will be re-entering the market. So, we think we're very well positioned there. Then to your question about the upgrade cycle. Look, I'm really excited about this year. I think AI is on every customer's mind. I think we're seeing the major companies really pushing ambitiously in the space. There was a lot of excitement around Apple's launches. Now, some of those technologies are good on legacy phones as well, like last year's phones we are told from those announcements. So, we'll have to see. I'm not really here to predict cycles. I'll tell you that we're very, very excited about what's coming. I want to remind people that our model isn't really dependent on that cycle. So, we've been benefiting from very low upgrade rates. In many ways, that's good for the efficiency of our model. But should upgrade rates take off due to a larger cycle based on excitement of a new phone launch, which we certainly hope for, that's a share-taking moment for us. So you either have a moment where we're able to be efficient like the last few quarters with some of these very low upgrade rates or because we are the net share-taker in this industry, a chance for more jump balls. So we design our business plan to be responsive to what happens, and at the same time, we're excited about with AI and we think consumers are excited about AI. We're looking forward to seeing what happens.\nSimon Flannery : Thanks Mike.\nKathy Au: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Rollins : Hi, good morning. I'm curious if you can unpack a bit more of where you saw the strength of the postpaid phone net ads in the quarter. You mentioned, I think, some diversified impacts during the quarter, but maybe a little bit more on where you stand on the rural market penetrations versus the top 100 and business versus consumer in terms of impacts. Then secondly, where is T-Mobile in terms of the multi-year return of capital goals? It's still up to $60 billion. And is there any change in timing or magnitude as you look at the performance in the second quarter and how much is left over the next, call it one and a half to two and a half years, if you are looking now at \u201826 to get to the destination? Thanks.\nMike Sievert: Sounds great, Mike. So I'm going to start with Jon Freier to talk about what we're seeing in the consumer space and where are those customers coming from?\nJon Freier: Yeah, you bet. So it's been a fantastic quarter, as you guys saw, with 777,000 postpaid phone net additions in Q2, our highest Q2 ever in the company's history, as we talked about just a few moments ago. When you look at smaller markets in rural areas, which is 40% of the U.S. population, our business continues to be incredibly responsive. As a matter of fact, in Q2, we had the highest switching that we have ever seen that quarter, and so that's great to see. We've been building a business as I've been talking to you about for the last three years, in smaller markets and rural areas with the network expansion, distribution expansion, bringing our value proposition into these markets. It's really, really doing incredibly well. So well, that we're just excited about the next turn and as we're setting our sights on ultimately getting to our fair share in the marketplace. So that's going really well. In addition to the growth in smaller markets and rural areas, we're seeing growth in the top 100 markets as well. So this is where we \u2013 Legacy, have been very successful over the last 2.5 decades, and for us to take the share position we have today and continue to build on it with more and more account growth is just great to see. Why that's really happening is because we have prime customers that are continuing to seek a better network experience. With the best-in-class 5G network and ultra-capacity, capabilities that we have in the top 100 markets, in addition to smaller markets, rural areas as well, we're really attracting those prime customers into our overall franchise. So we're just really excited about the overall growth. We're seeing good geographic responsiveness across the entire set of segments.\nMike Sievert: The other thing that we said in our prepared remarks, Mike, is that we took the highest percentage of broadband nets ever in our history this quarter. 75% or so and that's huge. That adds to all this. So we're obviously now resonating with customers on multiple topics. That plays on itself in some ways. So that's terrific to see. So you're looking across geographies, across customer segments, and even across product lines and seeing strength and those things start to play on each other. Okay. And your second question was about capital allocation strategy. Maybe we can start with the highest level, Peter, on how we think about this.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, absolutely. We've been remarkably, I think, consistent on this Mike, with regards to the multi-year arc. How we think about capital allocation has always been invest in the core business, drive the differentiation, particularly in network performance, so that we can continue to have that unique combination of best value and best network. After that, it was look for higher value accretive opportunities to create value over the long term for shareholders. When I think back around just from the last Analyst Day to now, it's been a significant amount of opportunity for us, whether that's been spectrum purchases to enhance the long term, continuing network leadership opportunity that we have, whether that's been things like Mint and Ultra and bringing that great brand into the Team Magenta family, whether that's some of the announced acquisitions of U.S. Cellular, Metronet, Lumos. So that's been great, and all while doing that and delivering the results we have, we've also now had significant, already to-date, shareholder returns. Almost 150 million shares already repurchased and shortly here, our almost fourth dividend by the end of this year. So I couldn't be more excited about what we've done here. You know, in terms of exactly what day we'll finish any sort of up to $60 billion, that's really hard to predict for you. We kind of put a mid-2026 timeframe out there, because we're going to be focused on exactly that strategy, that capital allocation. And the underlying business itself has so much free cash flow generation and unlocked there that that's the exciting part here, is we can do all three of these things in our capital allocation framework and drive significant shareholder value. I think you asked about also Q2 progression. That I will say, you saw a little bit of a different arc in Q2, and that's nothing more than just, as we think about how to set strategies in place. Much like any prudent company, we do a multi-month 10b5-1 plan, and the particular plan we had in place hadn't anticipated maybe the pace of the run-up and the share price, and so we got out of the market there because of that one plan. But now that we're past the blackout, we certainly anticipate being back in the marketplace and delivering that up to now remaining $8.7 billion, inclusive of dividends for the year. So, well on pace. The business itself is what allows all of this capital allocation and investment, and we're very proud of what we've done to-date and what the future looks like here.\nMike Sievert: Well said, Peter. So, I mean, for us we're really pleased to be able to try to have it both ways here. So many incredible opportunities have presented themselves, and we have seized on those things. That's certainly what you want us to be doing, and yet at the same time, we have these ambitions for shareholder returns that are principally unchanged, and to be able to have it both ways is amazing, because you would expect the trade-offs, but that shows you the strength of our business. And we've been talking for some time, that it would take us probably into 2026 to realize the business support for that up to $60 billion in shareholder returns, and that's certainly the case as we look at all these transactions that are adding long-term value to the company. But stay tuned, and we'll do the best we can to keep that cash flow rolling in for years to come.\nPeter Osvaldik: That\u2019s right.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nKathy Au: Thank you, Mike. Operator, we're ready for our next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Two if I may. Now that you've begun to gain appreciable broadband scale with fixed wireless, can you comment on your penetration of mobile wireless subscribers inside your broadband base on fixed wireless? And then secondly, could you comment on the overall pricing environment and long-term sustainability of pricing actions and the extent to which you contemplate additional actions given the well-controlled churn of your reported in the quarter?\nMike Sievert: Okay, great. You can do the math on the first one. We've now reached $5.6 million homes with our broadband product. It's just an amazing result. The strength continues with this quarter's performance being perhaps our best ever in the competitive context. And what's interesting is, our customers love this product. So we're also winning so much great feedback from third parties and from customers as to how this product performs. It gives us lots of confidence for the long-term legs of the initiative. And you can do the numerator and denominator math. We have said the majority of that $5.6 million is from existing T-Mobile customers. That means they also have mobile, and so they'd be part of our mobile accounts, but we haven't broken it out in exact numbers for you. And the rest represent kind of a land and expand strategy that we've been talking about, which is people coming in from the top 100 markets, also from smaller markets in rural areas, and choosing T-Mobile through the broadband front door, and then giving us an opportunity to sell wireless, which is a cool dynamic to see. But Mike Katz, maybe you can talk about how this product is resonating in the marketplace, because I think it's one of the things that might surprise some people.\nMichael Katz: Yeah, and you said it at the beginning. I think the key to the success of this product is it's a great product. And one of the things that we're seeing, and we've seen this for some time, is the satisfaction rates on our FWA product lead the industry, and every other category of broadband, including fiber, 3x higher than cable. And that is not just staying flat, it's actually improving. The delta of satisfaction between T-Mobile US, FWA, and the rest of the industry is expanding, which we're really excited about. And that's translating exactly into the results that we just talked about, where you saw the biggest share of broadband growth in Q2 coming from T-Mobile US, both because we're attracting more customers, and because we're seeing churn decrease across every 10-year cohort within the base. And it's because it's a great product, and it's serving a need in markets where there's been very, very little choice. So it's a just fantastic job by the team.\nMike Sievert: James, onto your second question about pricing, I can tell you that our strategy, which has been in place for so many years, is not a strategy that we have any interest in changing. We are the service revenue growth leader in this industry. We are the post-paid service revenue growth leader by a wide margin, and we do that because we have a value proposition that customers trust us around. And that's not to say that we're not going to make changes. We made changes this year to keep up with the times, first in a decade. But we like being the value leader, and that translates through our unique strategy into industry-leading revenue growth performance. Now, what you also see is the growth of per-customer revenues rising. We talked about our average revenue per account growing at well over 2%. And those kinds of things are great to see, but I want to make sure that people don't misinterpret our actions as anything other than keeping up with the times and reinforcing our strategy, which is a deeply trusted covenant with the world's consumers, American consumers, that we are and will be the best value in the marketplace. And that sometimes includes changes that we'll make along the way. And you saw us do that, and I think you saw us perform through it, because of that trusted relationship that we have with our consumers.\nJim Schneider : Thank you.\nKathy Au: Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDavid Barden: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups, if I could. I want to kind of come back to Simon's question. Mike, obviously with the Wall Street Journal article out there, suggesting that the reason you are being coy about the fiber strategy is because that's the straight, you know that's the game theory. You don't want people to believe that you have a bigger fiber strategy. In the Metronet press release, you called out, it was unique, it was capital light, but you kind of said the same thing about Lumos. So you had a $1 billion capital light transaction, then you had a $5 billion capital light transaction. Is there a reason to believe that you either need to do a $10 billion capital light transaction or a $20 billion capital light transaction? Or is there a reason that you definitely will not do those things? If you could kind of put a stake in the ground on that, I think a lot of people would be listening to that. I think the second follow-up would be just, I think in answer to, I think it was Mike's question on sources of postpaid phone growth. I know that you guys had some real success in enterprise. Hopefully, if you could elaborate a little bit on how that contributed to the quarter, it would be great. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Sure Dave, we'll do both of those things. First of all, I'll just go back to my comments from a few minutes ago and reiterate. Our appetite for further transactions in this space is limited. We really like the ones we've done. They give us a material footprint, and we're not currently working on something else like it. That being said, we're open-minded. You hire us on your behalf to be pragmatic, practical, strategic, and I think people can see our strategy. And if there's the right partner, the right asset, the right pricing on it, the right strategy, a bias and preference for pure play, we would be open-minded, but with a limited further appetite. And part of that is we're balancing all of our objectives. You heard Peter talk about our capital allocation strategy. We take that seriously. We think our investors like the fact that we have a pure play elegant model. As we step into fiber, we're keeping the elegance of that with a pure play fiber model. We want to be an outstanding execution machine that's able to execute really, really well in the marketplace. And we don't have any interest in changing the complexion largely of who we are as a company, because we perform so well. So, we're open-minded, but our appetite is limited from here on out.\nDavid Barden: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Now, second question, we'll turn to Callie Field to talk about what's going on in the business and enterprise space.\nCallie Field: Thanks Mike. I appreciate the question, Dave. I'll start with, once again, we outpaced our benchmark competitor in overall phone nets and phone churn. And we saw, once again, positive port trends across all segments against all of our competitors. Our CLVs are healthy. We're very pleased with the contribution of the business to overall growth. And what I'll also mention is that in S&B in particular, we had our best quarter ever in postpaid phone nets, up almost 20% year-over-year. In enterprise, our win share continues to be our overall share. And I'll also mention, our prices are competitive. We continue to be a value leader, but customers are choosing us because we're the best. We have the best, the fastest, the largest, the most reliable, most consistent network. And what we've seen is that CIOs and CTOs at large enterprises and even in the federal government space are really seeing what a 5G standalone core, what a commercially available network slicing and advanced network solutions can do for them. And we're starting to see some growth in our funnels and customers really coming to us to evaluate our entire solution portfolio. And so we see both growth, but also opportunities to expand our existing relationship with customers in growing ARPA. And some examples of that that I'll just share really quickly is, the largest oil and gas company in the United States chose us to provide advanced network solutions in their innovation lab, but they also for all of their mobile workforce selected T-Mobile to provide phones and tablets and then added onto that, our SASE T-SIM secure products. So that's an example of how we're expanding our relationship with our customers in a way that's profitable and we're very pleased with the business overall.\nMike Sievert: Well said.\nDavid Barden: Thank you both.\nKathy Au: Thanks Dave. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett : Hi, good morning. I want to return to the fiber strategy for a second. Can you talk \u2013 I know you've said in the past that this is not really part of a convergence strategy, but it's been so much talked about by your peers and competitors. You've obviously learned quite a bit in offering a bundle of wireless mobile and fixed wireless access with your FWA product. How are you thinking about convergence and the need for a converged offer? Because again, we go back to the same conversation we've been having about what to expect going forward. The two deals you've got give you eventually 10% coverage of the country by the end of the decade. Is that a sufficient strategy for you or do you need to think differently about what your converged offers and coverage will be?\nMike Sievert: Hey Craig, great question. Like I said, over the long haul, we're open-minded. We're very proud of these transactions. We want to execute them extremely well. We want to get them closed and we'll take a wider lens and see where we are and what we've learned. One thing we feel very strongly about, and I'm not sure I like the phrasing \u2018not believers in convergence.\u2019 I'll parse it differently for you. One thing we feel very strongly about is that these transactions are not defensive of our mobile business. We believe our mobile business stands strongly alone. Consumer choice has been made very clear that wireless is a deeply considered sale. It's the primary purchase decision in a connected life and that people will choose the wireless company that is right for them. And we believe we will compete effectively as a pure play wireless company, regardless of our simultaneous participation in broadband. That being said, convergence is real and that the customers that buy both, buy them together, and we have bundles today. Many of our 5.6 million broadband customers today purchased that in a bundle and realized discounts by doing so and there's nothing wrong with that. We think that's a dynamic that makes sense. Customers love discounts. Discounts make sense to customers, but they can come in many forms. And so I want to \u2013 convergence is happening and that some people are buying these things together and they kind of like that. It's not happening in the sense that if you don't have this product, you can't compete in mobile. We have zero evidence to support that thesis, and so I want to make sure that we parse it that way. And then secondly, of course, over the long haul we're open-minded about this. I just want to make sure that we're really smart about how we do it. And for us, joining with some of these very, very high quality teams who are doing this the best in the country and are doing it in an elegant and pure way, and at a pace that's really impressive, is a fantastic way for us to step into this. We're not going to make further decisions about where to go from here until we're able to get more experience in the ground.\nKathy Au: Thanks Craig. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin : Thanks Mike. Just one follow-up on Craig's question. So AT&T said they are seeing 500 basis points of additional mobile market share in markets where they've got fiber. I take it from what you just said, sort of zero evidence of a convergence benefit to mobile, that you are just not seeing that. Would you think that there's sort of the benefit that AT&T's seeing there is really just sort of a selection bias? And then I have a bunch of questions on the Metronet deal. I'm hoping you guys can give us some more details. First on, how much of the $4.9 billion went towards buying the retail business versus the network? How much of the $4.9 billion stays on the balance sheet to fund the future investments? How much cash is coming in from KKR and Oak Hill alongside your cash? And how much additional debt you expect to take on in order to get to the $6.5 million?\nMike Sievert: Okay. Well Peter, why don't you just shift the spreadsheet over there to go? Honestly Jon, let me answer the first one. First of all, it's very hard for us to tell, and I think even for others who are saying those things to tell what's causal. And so it does appear that the statement is true that that competitor's share is higher where they also have broadband, but they have broadband in places of their historic strength, and including back when their broadband product wasn't that interesting and so it's hard to tell what's causal there. The one thing that does appear to be linked in a way that's somewhat causal is that churn looks to be lower. And when people buy these bundled offers, there does appear to be a marginal impacted churn, which is attractive. And again, that's one of the thesis for why we like this. We think we can outperform a purely disinterested financial investor because of the embedded customer base. But remember, churn and wireless is already historically low. So there's only so much benefit you can count on from that on the wireless side. And it's one of the reasons why, again, we don't think it's necessary as a defense of our mobile business far from it.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, and on the Metronet Deal, before I ship over the spreadsheet to everybody, I think, if we step back to your point, there's a number of components of the $4.9 billion. And one of those is, of course, 50% ownership in the JV itself. Another element of it is actually acquiring all of the residential customers as well as the exclusive rights to distribute, service, etcetera, residential customers in the future as the build continues. And then the third part is funding the JV itself. So that, to get to that 6.5 million households past number, that business plan as it stands, actually contemplates the need for no additional equity contributions. Of course, the JV itself will be appropriately levered, and this is a JV that's off of our balance sheet with counterparty. So I can't unfortunately disclose all elements of this, but those are the three main components. And in fact, not only does it not require additional equity contributions, we anticipate, that again to meet that business plan of 6.5 million households past that will get dividends back from the JV during the pendency of this through 2030, well in excess of a $1 billion. So yeah, I can't parse every element of it for you out, but it is all three of those together, as well as kind of the dividends coming back and the great pre-funding to keep this build machine going and get to that 6.5 million.\nJonathan Chaplin : Got it. One last sort of follow-up question, just on \u2013 okay, great. Thanks K.\nMike Sievert: That's okay, Jon. Go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin : You'll take it? Just on the business consumer mix question, on fixed wireless broadband, can you give us a sense of how much of the ads coming in are from business and how that's evolved?\nMike Sievert: Sure, yeah. We have \u2013 we saw this product across all of our major brands and segments and so we have post-paid consumer, we just have prepaid consumer and we have business. And so far it's been predominantly, the majority of it has been post-paid consumer. It's going really well, and it kind of speaks to the ongoing opportunity that we have in the other segments, and so that's just how it's been flowing in. The product is really resonating with post-paid consumers and I talked earlier in the call about how these things tend to kind of feed on themselves. And inside of this segment, we're benefiting from so much person-to-person talk value. As people get this, they tell their friends about it, how much money they're saving. You heard from Mike about how this product is resonating. I mean, it's really performative and that surprises some people pleasantly and so those things kind of feed on it. So I think a lot of that opportunity might still be in front of us on the business side.\nJonathan Chaplin : Got it. Thanks guys.\nKathy Au: Okay. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Mike, maybe on the fiber part, it could be helpful to understand how you think about the build plan. In the sense that, is this maybe a strategy to open up capacity on the fixed wireless side by maybe migrating some subscribers over from fixed wireless to fiber, or is this just an additional opportunity to expand the footprint? And so in that sense, do you really need to have an overlap as you think through the fiber build plan with your fixed wireless footprint, or could you just think about this completely independently? And then, Peter, maybe from a housekeeping perspective, there's a lot of puts and takes in terms of EBITDA guidance this year. We obviously have Mint, and there is ACP, the price increases. So maybe if you could just parse out the components, just to understand what the core trend lines look like, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay Kannan, those are great questions. First of all, on the fiber and the interplay with our fixed wireless business, actually a fantastic question. I'll turn to Mike Katz.\nMichael Katz: Yeah, it is a fantastic question, because we see \u2013 one of the reasons why we're excited about fiber is we do think it is quite complementary to our fixed wireless business. Both, in situations where customers that are looking for a different kind of performance, like symmetrical speeds, have an upsell path. But also because, remember, our fixed wireless business is an excess capacity model. So we sell fixed wireless in places in the network where we have excess capacity that won't be consumed either now or in the future by normal mobile usage, and that's where we sell fixed wireless. And in places where we deploy fiber, there's an opportunity for us to take some of the demand that we're seeing in fixed wireless, where those excess capacity pockets don't exist and move them to fiber. So there's really a bunch of complementary features to it. I think to your question, I think it's a really interesting one. I can tell you, it's not the primary thesis of why we're doing fiber. I think we're doing fiber for all the reasons that Mike and Peter talked about. We think our unique asset set allows us to drive enterprise value and gives us advantage in fiber, that's the primary thesis. But I think a really unique potential tertiary opportunity is the one that you pointed out, where fixed wireless users as they migrate to fiber, opens up potentially additional spots for fixed wireless, because of the nature of the excess capacity model. So I think it's a really interesting point and probably an opportunity for us as we deploy more fiber footprint.\nMike Sievert: And to illustrate that, we have a long, long list of people who have expressed interest in our fixed wireless product that we're not able to serve, because we only put it in places where there's open capacity.\nMichael Katz: Yeah, that's right. I think that's one of the assets that we bring here, is that we have demand in some sense that exceeds supply because of excess capacity that we can immediately move into fiber.\nMike Sievert: So, great question, and on to the second piece Peter.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah. I think it's a really astute question in terms of what's happening underneath and what are all the puts and takes of the EBITDA guide and how should I think about the core business underneath, so very, very important. And of course, predominantly what's happening with core EBITDA and the ongoing tremendous growth, 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the guide is continued profitable share taking from a customer perspective. You see, not only our ability to deliver, of course, outsized customer ads, whether that's in postpaid phone or total postpaid or the prepaid side of the house, but also translate that vis-a-vis ARPA and other initiatives into service revenue growth that's outsized as well from an industry perspective. So the vast majority of what you are seeing on the trend line of EBITDA growth, is the continued execution by this team on outsized customer share taking and translation of that into financial performance. I'd say the counter to that in terms of a one-year impact. So EBITDA perhaps would be even better had it not been for ACP, and the impacts of the wind down of the government program, which again, that is that $350 million to $450 million range, which we'll see primarily in the second half of this year. And that'll distort the trend line until that fully winds down, which we anticipate be fully gone by Q4. And then we'll see be back to kind of this profitable growth element of it taking over without this one-time distortion.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Good. Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Shall we take a moment to see what's online, Kathy? We do have questions coming in online. We could hit in a rapid fire manner. Tech Life Channel, are you completely averse to copper assets or would you consider them as a way to achieve more fiber? I think the words I would use is, strong bias. We love the idea of the elegant model of a pure play fiber asset. The teams that have that are performing beautifully, so it's a bias. It's not a complete aversion to the premise of your question. Roger Entner, how is TFB progressing? Callie, you spoke earlier about enterprise strength. What about small and medium business? You want to talk about that briefly?\nCallie Field: Yeah, we continue to see strong growth. Obviously our legacy business began in S&B. It's where we have the most share. It's where our channels and assets really shine in our core wireless business. And something I'm really pleased that our team has been able to do is to, as I was mentioning in enterprise, build a broader solutions portfolio that really addresses the needs of small businesses. So in both small and medium sized business, we continue to grow share. We continue to see very attractive CLVs and I'm pleased with the pace of the business. It's also a place where we see continued quarter-over-quarter growth in our fixed wireless business and still have opportunities to go back to our base and open up more opportunities in fixed wireless. So a lot of really good things going on for our small businesses there.\nMike Sievert: The strong CLVs across both consumer \u2013 sorry, across both small and medium and across enterprise really points to the fact that customers are buying this product for the reasons you outlined, which is just a great product. It's also a great value, but they are buying it because it's a great product and you see that in the strong CLV development, so great point. Walt Picheck [ph], the U.S. is a big opportunity. So why not more fiber? Why stop there? Kabletown, with a K, would say this confirms the questionable return on investment. Look, we're open minded over the long haul, as I said, and I would take exception to the questionable return on investment as it relates to T-Mobile. I really don't know enough about this to know whether or not in the absence of T-Mobile, a lot of the companies out there are going to perform with great ROIs. But T-Mobile can outperform, because we have billions of dollars and years of embedded investment to create a capability and know-how that we bring to the game. And so you could actually \u2013 the things could be simultaneously true. I don't know. Cable could say, look, these guys will struggle. We don't plan to struggle. We bring a lot to the fight. Bill Ho, what's the long-term trend of ARPA service revenue contribution? We talked about revenue development, but I think talking about ARPA and where we see ARPA going as a key measure of revenue per customer. Any comments on that, Peter?\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, of course, I won't update long-term guidance here, but much like what you saw in 2024 and what our guide is, our strategy has been to continue to increase ARPA. And it's because this network, consumers businesses are hungry for more of the experience that this network creates and provides, whether that's in the postpaid phone category itself, whether that's in other connected devices such as fixed wireless, watches, tablets, new connectivity solutions out there. That is what's driving ARPA expansion. And that's the strategy, share-taking combined with ARPA expansion, earned ARPA expansion with the network experience that they have and the value leadership that we provide, to continue to drive for the long haul ARPA growth. That's the strategy here. And of course, we'll have more on longer-term trends at another time.\nCallie Field: Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Cathy, back to the chorus.\nCallie Field: Sounds good. Operator, we're ready for the next question on the phone.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Kraft : Hi, good morning. I had two if I could. First, volumes have obviously remained very strong across the industry so far this year. Every company has beat on net ads, including cable. Based on what you're saying, just curious as to where you think the industry volume strength is coming from and how sustainable it is from here. And then secondly, Mike had talked about the adaptability of the business plan to respond to opportunities that arise in the market. I just wanted to ask, when we think about the EBITDA guidance, what is that assuming broadly about upgrade trends and/or industry switching activity in the second half of the year? Is there room in there for those to increase or if we did see an uptick in upgrades in industry switching, could that put some incremental pressure on EBITDA? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Okay Brian, I'll take the first one and ask Peter to comment on the second. You'll find it a little unsatisfying as an answer though, which is we find the industry level kind of hard to predict. The Q2 came in higher than we had expected in some cases and our business landed right about where we were planning. But if you look at the wider lens, the industry context was a little hard to predict and you kind of see that in our guide. We were able to flow through our Q2 beat versus consensus in our guide. It was a very strong quarter for us. You see that in the second half where we're sort of side eyeing that industry question because we just don't know. We're very confident in our plans for the second half.\nas: But maybe Peter, you could talk about what upgrade rates are assumed, generally speaking.\nPeter Osvaldik: Generally speaking, yeah. I mean look, [Multiple Speakers] I'll just send out all of my spreadsheets and we'll be in a good place, but that's exactly right. It's hard to predict. Again, if it's a higher upgrade rate, higher moment of switching, that creates higher ultimate customer value and enterprise value for us as well being the share taker. So that's part of the reason why we're always in a range scenario with EBITDA. Yes, we have the ACP element of it, but we also have the element of what is the opportunity going to be. If you see an opportunity where industry share taking can flow to our benefit more than we think, of course, we'll take it. You saw that happen in Q2 as we saw opportunities, we made investments and we took more shares. So that's part of the range. We are excited, of course, much like we all are at every holiday season and every new iPhone introduction as a moment of potential share taking. Can't predict exactly what's going to happen. But the EBITDA range gives us flexibility to achieve exactly what we want to with the plan.\nKathy Au: Thank you.\nBrian Kraft : Thanks to you both.\nKathy Au: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nPeter Supino: Hey, good morning. A couple of questions on broadband. In FWA, I wonder if you could describe how the mix of your gross ads has shifted, say from \u201823 maybe looking out to \u201825 or at least 24. I'm wondering if the percentage of gross ads or number of gross ads in dense metro and higher value, more dense suburban areas is falling and whether it's rising in smaller towns. Then another FWA question relating to the longer term of the fallow-capacity model. Using one cell as an example, today's fallow-capacity doesn't necessarily equal fallow-capacity three years from now to the extent that consumption across mobile and home is rising. And so as cells that today have room in the future get busier, is densification sometimes the right answer? Thank you.\nMike Sievert: Great. Well, let me start with the second one, which is the way our fallow-capacity model works is pretty sophisticated. We look at every sector and, in fact, smaller geographic elements than a sector and look at the predicted, not current, capacity usage of that sector, assuming ongoing share taking in line with historical norms of share taking in mobile phones, and assuming dramatic growth of usage of mobile phones on a per mobile phone basis, and ongoing growth in line with historical norms of usage for the actual broadband customers that we bring on. We take all that forward and drag it right, years, and then approve applicants for broadband only when that capacity will still be there. So that's one of the reasons why we have hundreds of thousands of people waiting for this product on waiting lists, because right down to your particular address, unless we're convinced that product will serve you for years to come in a way that drives your happiness and does it without interrupting anybody's mobile service, we don't accept your application. It's a very sophisticated model. One of the online questioners said that Verizon commented that they are balancing and capping at 400,000 a quarter in order to avoid disrupting mobile subs. Are you doing the same thing? And the answer is, no, because our broadband subscribers don't do that by virtue of how we do this. So it's a really sophisticated model that we're quite proud of. Now I forget the second half.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, it was really a question around the breakout of gross ads and are we still seeing the same amount coming from urban, suburban high quality? And the answer is, relatively yes. Of course, as we continue to build into smaller markets from rural areas, which again, I remind everybody for us, it's 40% of the population of the top 100 markets and everything else is smaller markets or rural areas, which has a lot of geography, a lot of great customers in it. So overall, yeah, the majority is still coming from cable. The breakout between smaller markets and rural areas in our top 100 is relatively the same, and they continue to be and more so very high quality ads. In fact, ARPUs are up year-over-year. Churn is down year-over-year. Obviously Mike Katz spoke a little bit about customer sentiment towards this product. So we couldn\u2019t be more proud of how the gross ads are continuing to flow in, and the makeup of those and the value that we are creating for customers as well as for T-Mobile itself.\nPeter Supino: Thank you both.\nKathy Au: Thanks Peter. Operator we have time for one last question. Please go ahead.\nOperator: The last question today comes from Sebastiano Petti with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSebastiano Petti : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick couple of housekeeping questions. On FWI, I think you are currently in the market with an online promo, I think for $55, but you had raised prices earlier in the year. Just help us think about the strategy behind that to the extent of how it fits into the overall strategy, particularly Peter, what you just kind of described to Mike, what you've been talking about on the call as well. Then another housekeeping question, you'd mentioned, I think Peter in your prepared remarks, that you expect normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trend in the second half of the year, similar to a year ago. Should we be thinking about that on a sequential basis or more relative to the prior year? Just trying to get a sense of what you meant there in terms of the guidance. Thank you.\nPeter Osvaldik: I\u2019ll start with the second one. Yeah, on the churn, I really meant kind of sequential trends. So what we saw last year was Q2 to Q3 sequentially was up 10 bps and Q3 to Q4 sequentially was up 9 bps, and so those are generally the sort of trends we'd expect. So as you think about what we just delivered in Q2, I'd anticipate a similar sequential increase in terms of number of bps, and similarly then from Q3 to Q4 of this year. So that's kind of the housekeeping around that.\nMike Sievert: But we kind of wish it was that precise.\nPeter Osvaldik: Yeah, it's not that precise. That's the general expectation for sure.\nMike Sievert: On the 5G broadband pricing, I would say you were asking what should be read into that from a strategy standpoint, and I would say nothing. What you'll see from us is we try things, we learn, we have test cells, we do things online, we do things in markets, and we're always looking to see kind of what resonates and what people respond to. But overall, the general trend for us, is that we are post the period where we were discounting every customer all the time during the introductory years. We've moved back to a normative pricing that we think is highly attractive, and we like to understand those elasticities. So you'll always see us doing things. Before I hand it to Kathy to wrap things up, I will just tell you, thank you for all these great questions. It's just an absolute pleasure to be able to talk about this team's outstanding performance quarter-after-quarter. We kept our prepared remarks to just 11 minutes so we could get to lots and lots of your questions. That's because we love you and we listen to you. So we try to be responsive. And Kathy, we\u2019ll let you wrap this up.\nKathy Au: Thanks Mike. That's all the time we have for questions, and we appreciate everyone joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. If you have any further questions, you may contact the Investor Relations or Media Department.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile second quarter earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a pleasant day.",

            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Mike. As you can see, we delivered yet another strong quarter. Mike already highlighted the momentum in our wireless and broadband business as well as our impressive financial results. But, before turning to our outlook, I wanted to briefly touch on our acquisition of Mint Mobile and Ultra on May 1st. We couldn't be more excited for them to join Team Magenta. From a financial perspective, the acquisition resulted in a one-time prepaid base adjustment of approximately 3.5 million customers. Subsequent to the close, the incorporation of Mint and Ultra also resulted in approximately $100 million in net additional service revenue relative to Q1, which is net of the reduction in wholesale revenues and also resulted in a small benefit to core EBITDA as the revenue was largely offset with SG&A expenses as we made additional investments into the business to drive customer growth. All right, let me shift to an update on our expectations for the remainder of 2024. Starting with customers, we are excited to raise our total postpaid customer net additions to now be between 5.4 million and 5.7 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint relative to our prior guide. We now expect the total postpaid phone net customer additions component to be approximately half of our total postpaid additions, up from our expectations last quarter, and as part of that, we anticipate normal seasonal postpaid phone churn trends in the second half, as we saw a year ago. We continue to expect our full year postpaid ARPA to be up to 3% higher year-over-year, and our industry leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023. We now expect our core adjusted EBITDA to be between $31.5 billion and $31.8 billion for the full year unchanged at the midpoint, which is up 9% year-over-year. This includes our latest estimate on the impact of ACP, as well as funding our higher postpaid customer guide. On ACP, we now expect the year-over-year impact to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million, driven primarily by what we're seeing at some of our wholesale providers. Okay, turning to cash CapEx, we now expect to be between $8.7 billion and $9.1 billion as we continue to invest and lead in network performance with unmatched capital efficiency. While our longer-term expectations continue to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range annually, as we discussed before, 2024 is a bit lower given certain capital efficient network activities such as spectrum refarming and deploying additional 2.5 gigahertz licenses from auction 108, benefiting from the significant 5G radio deployments during our merger integration. We would expect Q3 to be the low water mark for the year before we accelerating in Q4 with more site upgrades and build activity. Lastly, we now expect the adjusted free cash flow, which includes payments for merger related costs to be in the range of $16.6 billion to $17 billion, up $150 million at the midpoint and up 24% year-over-year, driven by both margin expansion and capital efficiency and translating to an industry-leading service revenue to adjusted free cash flow margin. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter and expect another year of durable and differentiated growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry. We are looking forward to sharing more on our multi-year plans to continue to unlock shareholder value at Capital Markets Day this fall. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Kathy to begin the Q&A. Kathy. Okay. Yeah, and thanks, Simon. As you know, and just as a little bit of a history lesson for us, is we didn't participate in ACP through our postpaid brand. So there were no subscribers added there, and through Metro, we had a very small amount of customers. We primarily serve these customers through our Assurance brand, which didn't include subscriber counts and through supporting our wholesale partners. If I think about the arc of the $350 million to $450 million impact, given, of course ACP was still in play in Q1 and partially in Q2, I'd see the majority of that impact happening in the second half and even more of it in Q4 than Q3, because still a little bit of a tail coming in Q3. So, that's the best view. Primarily the majority of that, again, is going to be in wholesale and other service revenues. I'd expect Q4 to be probably the biggest impact there. Yeah, absolutely. We've been remarkably, I think, consistent on this Mike, with regards to the multi-year arc. How we think about capital allocation has always been invest in the core business, drive the differentiation, particularly in network performance, so that we can continue to have that unique combination of best value and best network. After that, it was look for higher value accretive opportunities to create value over the long term for shareholders. When I think back around just from the last Analyst Day to now, it's been a significant amount of opportunity for us, whether that's been spectrum purchases to enhance the long term, continuing network leadership opportunity that we have, whether that's been things like Mint and Ultra and bringing that great brand into the Team Magenta family, whether that's some of the announced acquisitions of U.S. Cellular, Metronet, Lumos. So that's been great, and all while doing that and delivering the results we have, we've also now had significant, already to-date, shareholder returns. Almost 150 million shares already repurchased and shortly here, our almost fourth dividend by the end of this year. So I couldn't be more excited about what we've done here. You know, in terms of exactly what day we'll finish any sort of up to $60 billion, that's really hard to predict for you. We kind of put a mid-2026 timeframe out there, because we're going to be focused on exactly that strategy, that capital allocation. And the underlying business itself has so much free cash flow generation and unlocked there that that's the exciting part here, is we can do all three of these things in our capital allocation framework and drive significant shareholder value. I think you asked about also Q2 progression. That I will say, you saw a little bit of a different arc in Q2, and that's nothing more than just, as we think about how to set strategies in place. Much like any prudent company, we do a multi-month 10b5-1 plan, and the particular plan we had in place hadn't anticipated maybe the pace of the run-up and the share price, and so we got out of the market there because of that one plan. But now that we're past the blackout, we certainly anticipate being back in the marketplace and delivering that up to now remaining $8.7 billion, inclusive of dividends for the year. So, well on pace. The business itself is what allows all of this capital allocation and investment, and we're very proud of what we've done to-date and what the future looks like here. That's right. Yeah, and on the Metronet Deal, before I ship over the spreadsheet to everybody, I think, if we step back to your point, there's a number of components of the $4.9 billion. And one of those is, of course, 50% ownership in the JV itself. Another element of it is actually acquiring all of the residential customers as well as the exclusive rights to distribute, service, etcetera, residential customers in the future as the build continues. And then the third part is funding the JV itself. So that, to get to that 6.5 million households past number, that business plan as it stands, actually contemplates the need for no additional equity contributions. Of course, the JV itself will be appropriately levered, and this is a JV that's off of our balance sheet with counterparty. So I can't unfortunately disclose all elements of this, but those are the three main components. And in fact, not only does it not require additional equity contributions, we anticipate, that again to meet that business plan of 6.5 million households past that will get dividends back from the JV during the pendency of this through 2030, well in excess of a $1 billion. So yeah, I can't parse every element of it for you out, but it is all three of those together, as well as kind of the dividends coming back and the great pre-funding to keep this build machine going and get to that 6.5 million. Yeah. I think it's a really astute question in terms of what's happening underneath and what are all the puts and takes of the EBITDA guide and how should I think about the core business underneath, so very, very important. And of course, predominantly what's happening with core EBITDA and the ongoing tremendous growth, 9% year-over-year at the midpoint of the guide is continued profitable share taking from a customer perspective. You see, not only our ability to deliver, of course, outsized customer ads, whether that's in postpaid phone or total postpaid or the prepaid side of the house, but also translate that vis-a-vis ARPA and other initiatives into service revenue growth that's outsized as well from an industry perspective. So the vast majority of what you are seeing on the trend line of EBITDA growth, is the continued execution by this team on outsized customer share taking and translation of that into financial performance. I'd say the counter to that in terms of a one-year impact. So EBITDA perhaps would be even better had it not been for ACP, and the impacts of the wind down of the government program, which again, that is that $350 million to $450 million range, which we'll see primarily in the second half of this year. And that'll distort the trend line until that fully winds down, which we anticipate be fully gone by Q4. And then we'll see be back to kind of this profitable growth element of it taking over without this one-time distortion. Yeah, of course, I won't update long-term guidance here, but much like what you saw in 2024 and what our guide is, our strategy has been to continue to increase ARPA. And it's because this network, consumers businesses are hungry for more of the experience that this network creates and provides, whether that's in the postpaid phone category itself, whether that's in other connected devices such as fixed wireless, watches, tablets, new connectivity solutions out there. That is what's driving ARPA expansion. And that's the strategy, share-taking combined with ARPA expansion, earned ARPA expansion with the network experience that they have and the value leadership that we provide, to continue to drive for the long haul ARPA growth. That's the strategy here. And of course, we'll have more on longer-term trends at another time. Generally speaking, yeah. I mean look, [Multiple Speakers] I'll just send out all of my spreadsheets and we'll be in a good place, but that's exactly right. It's hard to predict. Again, if it's a higher upgrade rate, higher moment of switching, that creates higher ultimate customer value and enterprise value for us as well being the share taker. So that's part of the reason why we're always in a range scenario with EBITDA. Yes, we have the ACP element of it, but we also have the element of what is the opportunity going to be. If you see an opportunity where industry share taking can flow to our benefit more than we think, of course, we'll take it. You saw that happen in Q2 as we saw opportunities, we made investments and we took more shares. So that's part of the range. We are excited, of course, much like we all are at every holiday season and every new iPhone introduction as a moment of potential share taking. Can't predict exactly what's going to happen. But the EBITDA range gives us flexibility to achieve exactly what we want to with the plan. Yeah, it was really a question around the breakout of gross ads and are we still seeing the same amount coming from urban, suburban high quality? And the answer is, relatively yes. Of course, as we continue to build into smaller markets from rural areas, which again, I remind everybody for us, it's 40% of the population of the top 100 markets and everything else is smaller markets or rural areas, which has a lot of geography, a lot of great customers in it. So overall, yeah, the majority is still coming from cable. The breakout between smaller markets and rural areas in our top 100 is relatively the same, and they continue to be and more so very high quality ads. In fact, ARPUs are up year-over-year. Churn is down year-over-year. Obviously Mike Katz spoke a little bit about customer sentiment towards this product. So we couldn't be more proud of how the gross ads are continuing to flow in, and the makeup of those and the value that we are creating for customers as well as for T-Mobile itself. I'll start with the second one. Yeah, on the churn, I really meant kind of sequential trends. So what we saw last year was Q2 to Q3 sequentially was up 10 bps and Q3 to Q4 sequentially was up 9 bps, and so those are generally the sort of trends we'd expect. So as you think about what we just delivered in Q2, I'd anticipate a similar sequential increase in terms of number of bps, and similarly then from Q3 to Q4 of this year. So that's kind of the housekeeping around that. Yeah, it's not that precise. That's the general expectation for sure."

            "content": "Yeah, you bet. So it's been a fantastic quarter, as you guys saw, with 777,000 postpaid phone net additions in Q2, our highest Q2 ever in the company's history, as we talked about just a few moments ago. When you look at smaller markets in rural areas, which is 40% of the U.S. population, our business continues to be incredibly responsive. As a matter of fact, in Q2, we had the highest switching that we have ever seen that quarter, and so that's great to see. We've been building a business as I've been talking to you about for the last three years, in smaller markets and rural areas with the network expansion, distribution expansion, bringing our value proposition into these markets. It's really, really doing incredibly well. So well, that we're just excited about the next turn and as we're setting our sights on ultimately getting to our fair share in the marketplace. So that's going really well. In addition to the growth in smaller markets and rural areas, we're seeing growth in the top 100 markets as well. So this is where we \u2013 Legacy, have been very successful over the last 2.5 decades, and for us to take the share position we have today and continue to build on it with more and more account growth is just great to see. Why that's really happening is because we have prime customers that are continuing to seek a better network experience. With the best-in-class 5G network and ultra-capacity, capabilities that we have in the top 100 markets, in addition to smaller markets, rural areas as well, we're really attracting those prime customers into our overall franchise. So we're just really excited about the overall growth. We're seeing good geographic responsiveness across the entire set of segments."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Michael Katz",
            "content": "Yeah, and you said it at the beginning. I think the key to the success of this product is it's a great product. And one of the things that we're seeing, and we've seen this for some time, is the satisfaction rates on our FWA product lead the industry, and every other category of broadband, including fiber, 3x higher than cable. And that is not just staying flat, it's actually improving. The delta of satisfaction between T-Mobile US, FWA, and the rest of the industry is expanding, which we're really excited about. And that's translating exactly into the results that we just talked about, where you saw the biggest share of broadband growth in Q2 coming from T-Mobile US, both because we're attracting more customers, and because we're seeing churn decrease across every 10-year cohort within the base. And it's because it's a great product, and it's serving a need in markets where there's been very, very little choice. So it's a just fantastic job by the team. Yeah, it is a fantastic question, because we see \u2013 one of the reasons why we're excited about fiber is we do think it is quite complementary to our fixed wireless business. Both, in situations where customers that are looking for a different kind of performance, like symmetrical speeds, have an upsell path. But also because, remember, our fixed wireless business is an excess capacity model. So we sell fixed wireless in places in the network where we have excess capacity that won't be consumed either now or in the future by normal mobile usage, and that's where we sell fixed wireless. And in places where we deploy fiber, there's an opportunity for us to take some of the demand that we're seeing in fixed wireless, where those excess capacity pockets don't exist and move them to fiber. So there's really a bunch of complementary features to it. I think to your question, I think it's a really interesting one. I can tell you, it's not the primary thesis of why we're doing fiber. I think we're doing fiber for all the reasons that Mike and Peter talked about. We think our unique asset set allows us to drive enterprise value and gives us advantage in fiber, that's the primary thesis. But I think a really unique potential tertiary opportunity is the one that you pointed out, where fixed wireless users as they migrate to fiber, opens up potentially additional spots for fixed wireless, because of the nature of the excess capacity model. So I think it's a really interesting point and probably an opportunity for us as we deploy more fiber footprint. Yeah, that's right. I think that's one of the assets that we bring here, is that we have demand in some sense that exceeds supply because of excess capacity that we can immediately move into fiber."

            "content": "Thanks Mike. I appreciate the question, Dave. I'll start with, once again, we outpaced our benchmark competitor in overall phone nets and phone churn. And we saw, once again, positive port trends across all segments against all of our competitors. Our CLVs are healthy. We're very pleased with the contribution of the business to overall growth. And what I'll also mention is that in S&B in particular, we had our best quarter ever in postpaid phone nets, up almost 20% year-over-year. In enterprise, our win share continues to be our overall share. And I'll also mention, our prices are competitive. We continue to be a value leader, but customers are choosing us because we're the best. We have the best, the fastest, the largest, the most reliable, most consistent network. And what we've seen is that CIOs and CTOs at large enterprises and even in the federal government space are really seeing what a 5G standalone core, what a commercially available network slicing and advanced network solutions can do for them. And we're starting to see some growth in our funnels and customers really coming to us to evaluate our entire solution portfolio. And so we see both growth, but also opportunities to expand our existing relationship with customers in growing ARPA. And some examples of that that I'll just share really quickly is, the largest oil and gas company in the United States chose us to provide advanced network solutions in their innovation lab, but they also for all of their mobile workforce selected T-Mobile to provide phones and tablets and then added onto that, our SASE T-SIM secure products. So that's an example of how we're expanding our relationship with our customers in a way that's profitable and we're very pleased with the business overall. Yeah, we continue to see strong growth. Obviously our legacy business began in S&B. It's where we have the most share. It's where our channels and assets really shine in our core wireless business. And something I'm really pleased that our team has been able to do is to, as I was mentioning in enterprise, build a broader solutions portfolio that really addresses the needs of small businesses. So in both small and medium sized business, we continue to grow share. We continue to see very attractive CLVs and I'm pleased with the pace of the business. It's also a place where we see continued quarter-over-quarter growth in our fixed wireless business and still have opportunities to go back to our base and open up more opportunities in fixed wireless. So a lot of really good things going on for our small businesses there. Thank you. Sounds good. Operator, we're ready for the next question on the phone."

            "name": "Mike Sievert",
            "content": "Thanks, Kathy. Hi, everybody. Welcome to the call. We're coming to you from New York today. If you're watching online, you can see I'm with several members of the senior team ready to discuss these strong quarterly results and our recent news, and of course to take your questions. This T-Mobile team just continues to demonstrate strong execution across the board. We're taking up our customer growth and cash flow guidance for the full year once again. I'm going to begin with a comment on customer growth because this quarter not only represented our highest ever Q2 postpaid phone net ads in company history, but we also pushed past a major milestone, 100 million customer connections. This growth was once again balanced geographically across both smaller markets in rural areas and top 100 markets. We also grew our postpaid phone gross ads at the highest rate in nearly three years. At the same time, we delivered yet another, record low upgrade rate this quarter, speaking to the strength of our customers' experience on our differentiated 5G network. Speaking of experience, let me now turn to that network leadership. We swept every category for overall network performance in the latest Opensignal and Ookla tests. According to Opensignal, T-Mobile's download speeds are up to three times as fast as peers, alongside having nearly six times the 5G availability as our next closest competitor. Our network was also awarded the most consistent by both independent third parties, a key indicator of an overall superior network experience. We continue to invest thoughtfully and in a highly capital-efficient model to extend our network leadership, and it shows. It is really a privilege to see our team's hard work show up in recognition like this and to share it with you. Okay, turning to broadband. Our fixed wireless offering continues to resonate with customers, leading us to capture a record share of industry broadband net ads this quarter. And now we have an incredible 5.6 million fixed wireless broadband customers. I hope you all saw our news from last week, as I'm excited to talk to you about our partnership with KKR to acquire Metronet. The Metronet team is the nation's fastest growing pure play fiber provider. This is a unique company and asset. They already reach over 2 million homes today, and with this partnership are expected to grow to 6.5 million homes passed by 2030, bringing consumers greater choice where they need it most, and we are equally excited to work alongside KKR's expert infrastructure team on this project. As with our Lumos JV, T-Mobile will leverage our scale, brand, distribution, and existing customer relationships to grow faster and to do it smarter. I can't highlight enough how both the Metronet and Lumos JVs represent best in class partnerships in the fiber space. Because of the partners that we've chosen and T-Mobile's unique assets and capabilities, I believe this is going to be a very successful initiative for our shareholders. Now going back to the current business and our financials. In Q2, we once again demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth in customers and translating that to industry-leading service revenue growth and industry-leading core adjusted EBITDA growth. That, combined with our capital efficiency, has led to a record adjusted free cash flow quarter that grew 54% year-over-year and once again led the major wireless companies in free cash flow margins. I could not be more proud of this team's results this quarter. Okay, to sum it all up, we are staying true to our Un-carrier DNA while focusing on smart and profitable growth, delivering record financial results. Our durable and differentiated model continues to outperform and I look forward to sharing more about the Un-carrier's next chapter on value creation at our Capital Markets Day, which will be in the second half of September. We're going to get that on your calendars very soon. So Peter, let's hand it to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Yeah, John. Sure, let me start. I'll just ask the team to jump in. First of all, we're just really excited about where we are. This was a terrific transaction for us to be able to partner with KKR to acquire Metronet on top of our previous transaction to partner to acquire Lumos. So, now we have the beginnings of a critical mass in the space. For me, this is big. I mean, these two transactions taken together with our partnerships in the wholesale arena are going to allow us to reach millions of homes. The Lumos transaction, we see 3.5 million homes passed by 2028. The Metronet transaction, we see 6.5 million homes passed by 2030. There's probably a couple more million in the wholesale partnerships we have so far. So, that's a pretty significant footprint that we put together. More importantly, we've chosen the best assets in the space. We're very excited about this. Now, to the premise of your question, I think what people can see from our strategy are a number of things. One, our bias is pure play fiber, the simplicity and elegance of that model. It's doing it with partners so that we can get more leverage on our equity dollars. It's about best in class assets that are performing and growing like we're seeing. We have some further appetite, but not much. I want to make that clear. I mean, these transactions that we have done get us millions of homes past and do it in a way that we think is really smart and positive for our shareholders. So, while we're open-minded to things that fit this strategy, it would have to be the right deal. Our appetite is somewhat limited for more. I can tell you we're not currently working on another transaction like this, and since they've been coming every month or two, I want to make that clear as well. But we're really excited about this. This is a chance for us to make a big impact in the space and to do it with teams that are already the best in class out there. So that's that piece. The second you asked about performance. We can talk about our pilot markets. Those are going well. They're earlier in phasing. So, it's hard to see, but absolutely on track. To me, what's more interesting is looking at the performance of these already in-market teams that we are now going to be partnering with. Like Metronet, we see penetrations in the upper 30s and they're more mature markets because they already passed over 2 million homes. So, we can see at more scale how that asset's performing. Now, our thesis has always been that our brand and our distribution, our embedded customer base and our know-how can actually add performance to a partner like that in a very cost-effective way. But it's on top of a team that's performing very, very well. You bet. So, Peter, I'll turn to you on the ACP question and maybe I'll comment on the upcoming cycle. Simon, our prepaid nets of 179,000 were the best quarter we've posted in years. Part of that is obviously joining with Mint and Ultra. But part of that is that we have a fantastic portfolio of brands that meet the needs of value consumers. To the premise of your question, this is a year when value consumers, because of these changes, will be re-entering the market. So, we think we're very well positioned there. Then to your question about the upgrade cycle. Look, I'm really excited about this year. I think AI is on every customer's mind. I think we're seeing the major companies really pushing ambitiously in the space. There was a lot of excitement around Apple's launches. Now, some of those technologies are good on legacy phones as well, like last year's phones we are told from those announcements. So, we'll have to see. I'm not really here to predict cycles. I'll tell you that we're very, very excited about what's coming. I want to remind people that our model isn't really dependent on that cycle. So, we've been benefiting from very low upgrade rates. In many ways, that's good for the efficiency of our model. But should upgrade rates take off due to a larger cycle based on excitement of a new phone launch, which we certainly hope for, that's a share-taking moment for us. So you either have a moment where we're able to be efficient like the last few quarters with some of these very low upgrade rates or because we are the net share-taker in this industry, a chance for more jump balls. So we design our business plan to be responsive to what happens, and at the same time, we're excited about with AI and we think consumers are excited about AI. We're looking forward to seeing what happens. Sounds great, Mike. So I'm going to start with Jon Freier to talk about what we're seeing in the consumer space and where are those customers coming from? The other thing that we said in our prepared remarks, Mike, is that we took the highest percentage of broadband nets ever in our history this quarter. 75% or so and that's huge. That adds to all this. So we're obviously now resonating with customers on multiple topics. That plays on itself in some ways. So that's terrific to see. So you're looking across geographies, across customer segments, and even across product lines and seeing strength and those things start to play on each other. Okay. And your second question was about capital allocation strategy. Maybe we can start with the highest level, Peter, on how we think about this. Well said, Peter. So, I mean, for us we're really pleased to be able to try to have it both ways here. So many incredible opportunities have presented themselves, and we have seized on those things. That's certainly what you want us to be doing, and yet at the same time, we have these ambitions for shareholder returns that are principally unchanged, and to be able to have it both ways is amazing, because you would expect the trade-offs, but that shows you the strength of our business. And we've been talking for some time, that it would take us probably into 2026 to realize the business support for that up to $60 billion in shareholder returns, and that's certainly the case as we look at all these transactions that are adding long-term value to the company. But stay tuned, and we'll do the best we can to keep that cash flow rolling in for years to come. Okay, great. You can do the math on the first one. We've now reached $5.6 million homes with our broadband product. It's just an amazing result. The strength continues with this quarter's performance being perhaps our best ever in the competitive context. And what's interesting is, our customers love this product. So we're also winning so much great feedback from third parties and from customers as to how this product performs. It gives us lots of confidence for the long-term legs of the initiative. And you can do the numerator and denominator math. We have said the majority of that $5.6 million is from existing T-Mobile customers. That means they also have mobile, and so they'd be part of our mobile accounts, but we haven't broken it out in exact numbers for you. And the rest represent kind of a land and expand strategy that we've been talking about, which is people coming in from the top 100 markets, also from smaller markets in rural areas, and choosing T-Mobile through the broadband front door, and then giving us an opportunity to sell wireless, which is a cool dynamic to see. But Mike Katz, maybe you can talk about how this product is resonating in the marketplace, because I think it's one of the things that might surprise some people. James, onto your second question about pricing, I can tell you that our strategy, which has been in place for so many years, is not a strategy that we have any interest in changing. We are the service revenue growth leader in this industry. We are the post-paid service revenue growth leader by a wide margin, and we do that because we have a value proposition that customers trust us around. And that's not to say that we're not going to make changes. We made changes this year to keep up with the times, first in a decade. But we like being the value leader, and that translates through our unique strategy into industry-leading revenue growth performance. Now, what you also see is the growth of per-customer revenues rising. We talked about our average revenue per account growing at well over 2%. And those kinds of things are great to see, but I want to make sure that people don't misinterpret our actions as anything other than keeping up with the times and reinforcing our strategy, which is a deeply trusted covenant with the world's consumers, American consumers, that we are and will be the best value in the marketplace. And that sometimes includes changes that we'll make along the way. And you saw us do that, and I think you saw us perform through it, because of that trusted relationship that we have with our consumers. Sure Dave, we'll do both of those things. First of all, I'll just go back to my comments from a few minutes ago and reiterate. Our appetite for further transactions in this space is limited. We really like the ones we've done. They give us a material footprint, and we're not currently working on something else like it. That being said, we're open-minded. You hire us on your behalf to be pragmatic, practical, strategic, and I think people can see our strategy. And if there's the right partner, the right asset, the right pricing on it, the right strategy, a bias and preference for pure play, we would be open-minded, but with a limited further appetite. And part of that is we're balancing all of our objectives. You heard Peter talk about our capital allocation strategy. We take that seriously. We think our investors like the fact that we have a pure play elegant model. As we step into fiber, we're keeping the elegance of that with a pure play fiber model. We want to be an outstanding execution machine that's able to execute really, really well in the marketplace. And we don't have any interest in changing the complexion largely of who we are as a company, because we perform so well. So, we're open-minded, but our appetite is limited from here on out. Now, second question, we'll turn to Callie Field to talk about what's going on in the business and enterprise space. Well said. Hey Craig, great question. Like I said, over the long haul, we're open-minded. We're very proud of these transactions. We want to execute them extremely well. We want to get them closed and we'll take a wider lens and see where we are and what we've learned. One thing we feel very strongly about, and I'm not sure I like the phrasing \u2018not believers in convergence.' I'll parse it differently for you. One thing we feel very strongly about is that these transactions are not defensive of our mobile business. We believe our mobile business stands strongly alone. Consumer choice has been made very clear that wireless is a deeply considered sale. It's the primary purchase decision in a connected life and that people will choose the wireless company that is right for them. And we believe we will compete effectively as a pure play wireless company, regardless of our simultaneous participation in broadband. That being said, convergence is real and that the customers that buy both, buy them together, and we have bundles today. Many of our 5.6 million broadband customers today purchased that in a bundle and realized discounts by doing so and there's nothing wrong with that. We think that's a dynamic that makes sense. Customers love discounts. Discounts make sense to customers, but they can come in many forms. And so I want to \u2013 convergence is happening and that some people are buying these things together and they kind of like that. It's not happening in the sense that if you don't have this product, you can't compete in mobile. We have zero evidence to support that thesis, and so I want to make sure that we parse it that way. And then secondly, of course, over the long haul we're open-minded about this. I just want to make sure that we're really smart about how we do it. And for us, joining with some of these very, very high quality teams who are doing this the best in the country and are doing it in an elegant and pure way, and at a pace that's really impressive, is a fantastic way for us to step into this. We're not going to make further decisions about where to go from here until we're able to get more experience in the ground. Okay. Well Peter, why don't you just shift the spreadsheet over there to go? Honestly Jon, let me answer the first one. First of all, it's very hard for us to tell, and I think even for others who are saying those things to tell what's causal. And so it does appear that the statement is true that that competitor's share is higher where they also have broadband, but they have broadband in places of their historic strength, and including back when their broadband product wasn't that interesting and so it's hard to tell what's causal there. The one thing that does appear to be linked in a way that's somewhat causal is that churn looks to be lower. And when people buy these bundled offers, there does appear to be a marginal impacted churn, which is attractive. And again, that's one of the thesis for why we like this. We think we can outperform a purely disinterested financial investor because of the embedded customer base. But remember, churn and wireless is already historically low. So there's only so much benefit you can count on from that on the wireless side. And it's one of the reasons why, again, we don't think it's necessary as a defense of our mobile business far from it. That's okay, Jon. Go ahead. Sure, yeah. We have \u2013 we saw this product across all of our major brands and segments and so we have post-paid consumer, we just have prepaid consumer and we have business. And so far it's been predominantly, the majority of it has been post-paid consumer. It's going really well, and it kind of speaks to the ongoing opportunity that we have in the other segments, and so that's just how it's been flowing in. The product is really resonating with post-paid consumers and I talked earlier in the call about how these things tend to kind of feed on themselves. And inside of this segment, we're benefiting from so much person-to-person talk value. As people get this, they tell their friends about it, how much money they're saving. You heard from Mike about how this product is resonating. I mean, it's really performative and that surprises some people pleasantly and so those things kind of feed on it. So I think a lot of that opportunity might still be in front of us on the business side. Okay Kannan, those are great questions. First of all, on the fiber and the interplay with our fixed wireless business, actually a fantastic question. I'll turn to Mike Katz. And to illustrate that, we have a long, long list of people who have expressed interest in our fixed wireless product that we're not able to serve, because we only put it in places where there's open capacity. So, great question, and on to the second piece Peter. Shall we take a moment to see what's online, Kathy? We do have questions coming in online. We could hit in a rapid fire manner. Tech Life Channel, are you completely averse to copper assets or would you consider them as a way to achieve more fiber? I think the words I would use is, strong bias. We love the idea of the elegant model of a pure play fiber asset. The teams that have that are performing beautifully, so it's a bias. It's not a complete aversion to the premise of your question. Roger Entner, how is TFB progressing? Callie, you spoke earlier about enterprise strength. What about small and medium business? You want to talk about that briefly? The strong CLVs across both consumer \u2013 sorry, across both small and medium and across enterprise really points to the fact that customers are buying this product for the reasons you outlined, which is just a great product. It's also a great value, but they are buying it because it's a great product and you see that in the strong CLV development, so great point. Walt Picheck [ph], the U.S. is a big opportunity. So why not more fiber? Why stop there? Kabletown, with a K, would say this confirms the questionable return on investment. Look, we're open minded over the long haul, as I said, and I would take exception to the questionable return on investment as it relates to T-Mobile. I really don't know enough about this to know whether or not in the absence of T-Mobile, a lot of the companies out there are going to perform with great ROIs. But T-Mobile can outperform, because we have billions of dollars and years of embedded investment to create a capability and know-how that we bring to the game. And so you could actually \u2013 the things could be simultaneously true. I don't know. Cable could say, look, these guys will struggle. We don't plan to struggle. We bring a lot to the fight. Bill Ho, what's the long-term trend of ARPA service revenue contribution? We talked about revenue development, but I think talking about ARPA and where we see ARPA going as a key measure of revenue per customer. Any comments on that, Peter? Cathy, back to the chorus. Okay Brian, I'll take the first one and ask Peter to comment on the second. You'll find it a little unsatisfying as an answer though, which is we find the industry level kind of hard to predict. The Q2 came in higher than we had expected in some cases and our business landed right about where we were planning. But if you look at the wider lens, the industry context was a little hard to predict and you kind of see that in our guide. We were able to flow through our Q2 beat versus consensus in our guide. It was a very strong quarter for us. You see that in the second half where we're sort of side eyeing that industry question because we just don't know. We're very confident in our plans for the second half. Great. Well, let me start with the second one, which is the way our fallow-capacity model works is pretty sophisticated. We look at every sector and, in fact, smaller geographic elements than a sector and look at the predicted, not current, capacity usage of that sector, assuming ongoing share taking in line with historical norms of share taking in mobile phones, and assuming dramatic growth of usage of mobile phones on a per mobile phone basis, and ongoing growth in line with historical norms of usage for the actual broadband customers that we bring on. We take all that forward and drag it right, years, and then approve applicants for broadband only when that capacity will still be there. So that's one of the reasons why we have hundreds of thousands of people waiting for this product on waiting lists, because right down to your particular address, unless we're convinced that product will serve you for years to come in a way that drives your happiness and does it without interrupting anybody's mobile service, we don't accept your application. It's a very sophisticated model. One of the online questioners said that Verizon commented that they are balancing and capping at 400,000 a quarter in order to avoid disrupting mobile subs. Are you doing the same thing? And the answer is, no, because our broadband subscribers don't do that by virtue of how we do this. So it's a really sophisticated model that we're quite proud of. Now I forget the second half. But we kind of wish it was that precise. On the 5G broadband pricing, I would say you were asking what should be read into that from a strategy standpoint, and I would say nothing. What you'll see from us is we try things, we learn, we have test cells, we do things online, we do things in markets, and we're always looking to see kind of what resonates and what people respond to. But overall, the general trend for us, is that we are post the period where we were discounting every customer all the time during the introductory years. We've moved back to a normative pricing that we think is highly attractive, and we like to understand those elasticities. So you'll always see us doing things. Before I hand it to Kathy to wrap things up, I will just tell you, thank you for all these great questions. It's just an absolute pleasure to be able to talk about this team's outstanding performance quarter-after-quarter. We kept our prepared remarks to just 11 minutes so we could get to lots and lots of your questions. That's because we love you and we listen to you. So we try to be responsive. And Kathy, we'll let you wrap this up."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jud Henry, Senior Vice President, Strategic Adviser, Investor Relations for T-Mobile US. Please go ahead, sir. \nJud Henry: Welcome to T-Mobile's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today are Mike Sievert, our President and CEO; Peter Osvaldik, our CFO; as well as other members of the senior leadership team. \n During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements. We provide a comprehensive list of risk factors in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to review. Our earnings release, investor fact book and other documents related to our results as well as reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed on this call can be found in our Quarterly Results section of the Investor Relations website. \n And with that, let me turn it over to Mike. \nG. Sievert: Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome. If you're watching online, you can see that I've got a good part of the senior team here. We're coming to you from Bellevue, Washington today, and we're looking forward to a great discussion. \n And as you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a great start in 2024. The year is unfolding right in line with what we expected across the board, and in fact, better in some areas, and we're increasing our guidance for the year accordingly. I'll briefly touch on a few highlights, and then we'll get right to your questions. \n First, a comment on growth. We continue to take share in Q1 just as expected with postpaid phone net adds that were right in line with Q1 last year, while industry net adds were lower by a double-digit percentage. Our best value, best network proposition continues to resonate in the market with our postpaid phone gross adds up year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter even while industry gross adds were down. And we matched our best ever Q1 postpaid phone churn, showing that customers love the Un-carrier value proposition and network.\n Second, a comment on those lowest ever postpaid upgrades for phones in Q1. I think this metric showcases our ongoing winning formula by demonstrating that customers choose to stay with T-Mobile for the best-in-class value and network they enjoy, which is the only retention strategy that drives profitable growth over the long term. The network is an increasingly powerful part of our customers' loyalty as 3/4 of our postpaid phone customers already have a 5G smartphone, and they're having a differentiated experience on the T-Mobile network. It also demonstrates how we put our investments where they can have the greatest customer impact, letting natural customer demand drive the pace of upgrades. \n Overall, from consumers in major metros to smaller markets and businesses from large enterprises to SMBs, T-Mobile's durable, differentiated growth momentum continues across the segments. And the most exciting part is that there are still many years of market-leading growth runway ahead for our core business. \n Okay. Let's talk broadband. Home broadband customers love a great value on a great network, too. That's been the formula that's made us the fastest-growing broadband provider for the past 2 years. And we did it again in Q1 as our 405,000 nets are expected to represent a higher share of industry broadband net adds than even a year ago and are expected to be more than half of all nets from the major providers once again. Our broadband strategy is unfolding exactly the way we said it would. And we now proudly serve over 5 million high-speed Internet customers.\n And as we previously announced, we're also growing the value of that customer base, successfully sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions and attracting customers at our nominal price points. In addition, our new rate plans for home mesh networks and for on-the-go usage are just the latest ways we intend to continue to enhance the value of this space and find new ways to serve customers better. \n Okay. Let me comment on fiber. I've been saying for a while that smart fiber partnerships would allow us to profitably serve even more broadband customers. And today, we announced a joint venture with EQT that will acquire Lumos. Consistent with everything we've said for the last year, this JV is the latest example of a capital-light model, and we're excited to have such great and experienced partners. EQT is one of the leading infrastructure investors across the U.S. and Europe and brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. \n The Lumos management team under Brian Stading is outstanding and has years of experience building fiber in an efficient, cost-effective and targeted build model. We're really excited to be able to accelerate what Lumos has already been doing to reach more and more households in the years ahead.\n Together, we target 3.5 million homes passed by 2028, and T-Mobile expects to invest about $950 million upon close, which we expect less than a year from now, and another $500 million between 2027 and '28 to get there. T-Mobile will be a 50% owner of Lumos and will own the customer relationships, including their existing fiber customers at close, as Lumos will convert to a wholesale model. \n This is exactly the type of value-creating investment that we had contemplated with our strategic envelope of funds that we set aside back when we shared the current stockholder return program with you last fall. And we expect to remain on track as it relates to our stockholder return ambitions. \n Lastly, I am so happy to report that we have received regulatory approval to acquire Mint and Ultra Mobile. And we, therefore, currently expect to close on May 1. We are really looking forward to welcoming them to the Un-carrier family. And I know they're going to fit in because they are hyper-focused on offering customers compelling products at a great value. We'll work to further fuel their success while also learning from their team who are absolute rock stars in the direct-to-consumer and value segments. \n Financially, in Q1, we again showed how T-Mobile translates profitable growth into market-leading consolidated service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth that was double the rate of our principal competitors. And T-Mobile again delivered the highest free cash flow margins in the industry. \n So to wrap up. Our model is working. It's consistent. And our confidence in it only builds with each passing quarter of success. We remain focused on continuing to take share in wireless and broadband while delivering industry-leading growth in service revenue, profitability and cash flows. I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile. \n And I want you to know that we plan to have a Capital Markets Day this fall, where we look forward to going deeper with you on topics like the big opportunities that we see coming, how we're seizing them and how that will translate into enormous value creation for our company in the years ahead. And I think you're going to see once again that in many ways, we're just getting started. \n Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. \nPeter Osvaldik: Well, thank you, Mike. All right. As you can see, we kicked off 2024 with great momentum. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top and bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to adjusted free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into our updated expectations for how that growth will continue in 2024. \n Starting with customers, where we now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.2 million and 5.6 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint. We now expect full year postpaid ARPA to grow up to 3% in 2024, a further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023 from both the continued execution of our strategy to win and expand account relationships and as we anticipate taking further rate plan optimization actions within the base. \n There is no change in our expectations for postpaid phone net adds from our original guidance last quarter with Q1's strong growth coming in as we expected and because we anticipate slight year-over-year headwinds to postpaid phone net adds in Q2 and Q3 related to those rate plan optimizations, which are accretive to the business on an all-in basis. \n Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $31.4 billion and $31.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect our industry-leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023 even with the discontinuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program that appears imminent at this point in time and is contemplated within the increased guidance. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. \n Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $16.4 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up 23% over last year at the midpoint and 5x the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents an adjusted free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers. \n So in closing, we continue to expect 2024 to be another year of differentiated profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry, unlocking shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. \n Okay. Before we open it up for Q&A, I just want to take a moment to announce a changing of the guard in our Investor Relations leadership. After 11 years and an unbelievable 44 earnings cycles in IR, I'm tremendously excited for Jud to take on a broader role within our finance organization. And I'm equally excited to introduce Cathy Yao as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Many of you may know Cathy, from her time on the sell side at MoffettNathanson or on the corporate side at Altice USA among other roles on her fabulous resume. We look forward to Cathy continuing T-Mobile's strong tradition of Investor Relations excellence. \n And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin his last Q&A. Jud? \nJud Henry: Thanks, Peter. All right. Let's get to your questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll start with a question on the phone. Operator, first question, please. \nOperator: The first question comes from Michael Rollins with Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Congrats, Jud, on the new role. Just a couple of questions, if I could. So first, you mentioned that you may be taking some pricing actions and that could affect some of the subscriber performance in 2Q, 3Q. Can you unpack the plan on how you're approaching those actions and how to think about the net benefit? And then just secondly, taking a step back, if you can give us an update on how you're seeing the competitive landscape, how you're seeing the switcher pool and how T-Mobile is navigating some of these changes with the industry seemingly having lower upgrades, lower churn. \nG. Sievert: Okay. Great. Well, why don't I jump in, and I'll give a comment on -- or a lack of a comment on the first question, and then I'll hand it to Jon Freier for the second one. No, we're not really going to announce any particular plans today. I will tell you that nothing we do is going to question or challenge our long-standing strategy of being the value leader in this market. But surely, over the span of many years, what that means kind of changes over time. Costs have risen. Changes have happened in a broader industry context. And we're going to jealously guard that value leadership. And I think customers understand that if there are changes around the margins once every many years in a world where costs change, they'll understand and accept that. \n We've actually made changes here and there over the past 6 months. We've understood what that looks like and what that takes. And there may be more changes, particularly with older rate plans. But we're not here to announce anything. I will tell you that all the outcomes that we see from all of that on the customer side as well as on the ARPA side and on the EBITDA and revenue side are contained within the guidance that Peter just shared. Do you want to add anything in the first question before we go to the second one? \nPeter Osvaldik: I think you got it. \nG. Sievert: Okay. Competitive context on up -- what are we seeing on upgrades? What's driving that? What's happening with the competition, Jon? \nJon Freier: Yes, you bet. So I'll tell you a little bit about what's happening competitively. It's been an intense competitive environment in the marketplace, but it's been generally consistent as you look at this overall competitive intensity. And for our business, we continue to have these differentiated growth opportunities, whether that be smaller markets and rural areas, whether that be within our high-speed Internet or in our overall enterprise and government space that Callie can talk about in just a few moments as well. And so during that overall competitive context, we have these unique growth vectors that we continue to be underpenetrated on, driving a lot of good success so far but continue to have a lot of runway in front of us. \n So while that competitive environment is intense, sometimes one competitor is leaning in. Sometimes one competitor is leaning out. We're always navigating that. Things are always changing. Sometimes it's a little bit more device oriented. Sometimes it might be more rate oriented in terms of how the competitive environment is unfolding. But we've navigated that for years and years now and continue to be very comfortable with how that overall competitive environment is playing out. \n With respect to upgrades, we continue to meet the natural demand of upgrades. As you can see, the upgrade rate is a low 2.4% at the same time when we're matching the best Q1 postpaid phone churn performance in the company's history. We've been more targeted than surgical with some of our upgrade offers, for sure. But the overall natural demand and the upgrade cycle is lengthening. It's really kind of the best of both worlds when you have customers that are staying at incredible rates, record low rates and not staying for free devices exclusively. They're staying for this differentiated value proposition, the network and the overall experience, something we're very, very pleased with how it's unfolding. \nG. Sievert: I'll just add one last thing. As I said in my prepared remarks, 75% of our customers have 5G devices, and those customers are having a very differentiated experience with T-Mobile's lead in 5G. And we can talk more about that, I hope, during the call. I'm so pleased with what's happened. We continue to extend our lead. And so that -- the impetus when you're having a fantastic experience on your phone, to prematurely swap it out, just isn't there. And they'll do it in a stepwise way. They continue to do it. And you can tell we're upgrading people fast enough by the fact that all those people have 5G phones, which is right at or even above competitive benchmark. So our customers continue to upgrade at just the pace that we think is appropriate. \nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Maybe first on the Lumos transaction. Firstly, should we expect similar deals in other parts of the country? And you talked about 3.5 million homes passed. Is that about -- I mean that's just in one small part of the country. Should we expect something similar as we look at the rest of the U.S.? And then in the release today, you guys had a line about not being able to meet all the demand for broadband with your fixed wireless network. Can you talk a little bit about how much growth there is left there and if you're seeing capacity constraints in any particular areas? \nJanice Kapner: What kind of partner ecosystem are you building to execute on your strategy? \nG. Sievert: Let's go straight to Callie. \nCallie Field: Well, thanks, [ John ], for the question. We saw very strong growth in Q1, outpacing our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone nets. And to comment a little bit on the question that Jon was answering in the business category if we're seeing pressure in that category, I think it might be us. And one of the interesting things, I think, that's going on in our business right now is that not only are we delivering on top line growth but also on CLV growth across all segments. \n And in enterprise, we just delivered our strongest postpaid nets ever in the history of the company. We also delivered our lowest churn in enterprise. In SMB, we had our highest ever port ratios, and we're net positive for 7 consecutive quarters. So we're really liking the pace of the business. We've really graduated from just being a price comp to really a solution-oriented sale for customers. And we see that with partnerships with Dialpad Ai with delivering mission-critical push-to-talk. \n And I know, [ John ], you also asked who are some of the partners that we're working with in building our ecosystem. Obviously, we're partnering with the largest OEMs, working with Ericsson and Cisco as well as industry segment experts like [ OCS ] when it comes to serve our government customers. So really building out our ecosystem that allows us to really focus on enterprise solutions, enabling them to innovate and to love their customers at scale. \n I will mention just a couple of key wins in the Advanced Network Solution business. You might have read about our partnership agreement with Delta, where they named us as their preferred wireless provider. But we're also deploying a 5G hybrid network solution at their Atlanta headquarters, which we're really excited about. Also the U.S. Coast Guard is working with us build out a private network to deliver seamless secure connectivity from ship to shore. And then with Ericsson, not only as a strategic partner, but we're also working with them to deploy our first network slice on a SIM-based SASE solution within a 5G connected laptop. So we're really excited about the kinds of solutions, the sort of enterprises that we're bringing on and the momentum in the business overall. \nG. Sievert: It's really interesting when you hear us talk about enterprise, how different it is from 4 or 5 years ago. I mean we were trying our best to sell SIMs to companies that would take meetings with us like the procurement department. And what's happened in this 5G strategy as it's unfolded is Callie and team have built solutions to some of the most pressing connectivity problems that enterprises of all kinds face. And suddenly, we're in strategic conversations because we have capabilities like network slicing, like SIM-based security and many other emerging 5G capabilities that are way out in front. \n And that's not just giving us revenues in those advanced 5G services, but it's also winning us all those smartphones that we used to struggle so hard and back then have to price so hard to win. So it's been this really nice evolution. And make no mistake, we love low prices, and we're going to be the value leader here. But today, we're solving some of the most complicated connectivity problems that enterprises and organizations face. And that is a great place to compete. \nCallie Field: Yes. Thank you, Mike. Totally agree. \nJud Henry: Okay. All right. Let's try this again. Operator, can we get a question? \nOperator: The next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Great. So I have a couple of questions on the Lumos transaction. So first of all, should we just think of this transaction as sort of a one-off? Or should we expect other deals similar to this in other regions? And then of the 3.5 million homes that you guys are talking about passing, how big could that get over the next 5 years? So that's first. And then second of all, in the release, you guys talked about not being able to fulfill the demand that you're seeing in broadband on the fixed wireless side. How much growth is still left in fixed wireless? And are you seeing areas today where you're running out of capacity? \nG. Sievert: Okay. Let's start with the second one. All along, if I remind all of our listeners, I know you know this, our fixed wireless strategy has always been about selling excess capacity, where we predict normal cell phone usage won't suck up that 5G capacity. And so this gives us the opportunity to serve broadband customers. And now at scale, we're serving millions and millions of them under this strategy. We had originally said we saw this strategy leading to about 7 million to 8 million total customers in terms of opportunity. We don't have any updates on that. I've said several times, we're working on thinking about examining ways that we could try to extend that, and we haven't drawn any conclusions yet. We have to make sure it's done in an economic way, and we have to make sure it's done in a way that customers will love, and they have a fantastic product experience. \n That being said, what's interesting about fiber, fiber can be a strategy that relieves some pressure on the 5G network and extend the TAM, if you think about it, right, because some customers will -- where we offer fiber in the future, will be able to naturally graduate up to fiber, which is really a totally separate category. And that obviously opens up an opportunity for their neighbor to then become a 5G customer. So there's some TAM expansion there. \n And then to your point, even in places where Lumos currently operates, we have a long wait list of people who applied. They put their address in our system. They applied to be a fixed wireless customer, and we haven't accepted them yet because their address isn't one of those places that I described where we have the predicted excess capacity. So there's lots of opportunity there. \n As it relates to your first question around is this the first of many, et cetera, look, we don't have anything to say about that other than our strategy is to opportunistically find ways that are very capital-light, very smart to put our brand in this space, and we've done that here. And we think this will lead to millions of homes passed. And that's a great place for us to be. We're going to continue to learn, grow, expand. And we're open-minded about this. But we're not interested in any wholesale changes that basically change who we are. \n No big on-balance sheet acquisitions are currently being examined. It's not something that -- we know our investors like our fast, efficient, capital efficient, high capital return strategy, and we have no intentions of changing all that. That being said, if we can lay track for the long term in a very capital-efficient way, we're open-minded. And we really like this model that we've struck with EQT and Lumos, and can't wait to get started and get this approved through the regulatory bodies and begin to see this build out and accelerate. \nOperator: The next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. \nCraig Moffett: First, Jud, congratulations. But thank you for all those 40-some-odd quarters of your able support and help. And congratulations to Cathy if she's on the call. A question about ACP just because that's the obligatory topic this quarter. Can you just talk about what you expect with ACP, how you think that might affect your business, especially perhaps your prepaid business, but whether you think it will have an impact on your postpaid business as well? And you just introduced a plan where you no longer do credit checks, which I think was a head scratcher to me just coming right before the expiry of ACP. I wonder if you could just talk about how you plan to sort of ensure that ACP customers without government support won't upend that kind of an offer. \nG. Sievert: Well, let's start out with Mike Katz so we can disentangle some of these offers for you because there could be some misunderstanding out there. And then we'll go to Peter and talk about the financial, what we see in the financial picture as it relates to the expected turndown of ACP. \nMichael Katz: Yes. Thanks, Craig. First, to answer the first part of your question on what our expectations are with ACP, at this point, we're expecting that the program funding is going to end. And the impact of that is fully contemplated in the guidance that Peter talked about and shared earlier. \n And as a reminder, I think it's important to contextualize like how T-Mobile has participated in the ACP program. First of all, we have not participated in any form in postpaid across any products. It's nonexistent in our postpaid business. We have a small amount. I think we've said a couple of hundred thousand inside of our prepaid, our owned prepaid portfolio. And the vast amount of our participation is inside wholesale via wholesale partners that we work with. So for -- so just to contextualize where our participation is. \n That being said, we are both in the small amount that we have in our own prepaid business but also with the wholesale partners, working with them on communication and plans to help those customers transition. We think wireless is not a category that customers are going to walk away from. So these customers need another alternative, and we're working closely with the partners and with the customers to find them another alternative, whether it's other plans or other programs like Lifeline. So we're deep in doing that. \n And look, like we think if you look at T-Mobile, and Mike talked a lot about our passion around and focus around guarding our value position and the brands in our portfolio like Metro and soon to be Mint, these are all value brands that are focused on delivering value. And we think that's a great opportunity, both to help customers inside of our wholesale partners to transition, but honestly, customers that also may feel stranded from competitors to come to find a value to continue their wireless services. So I hope that's helpful for the question you're answering. \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And let me maybe add to that just a little bit on your other questions, Craig. And I think Mike really highlighted our thinking around this well. Of course, it's in front of us, more so than behind us. No new activations as of February, but it's in front of us, but we think it's fully baked into the guidance range that we gave you, the range of outcomes that we anticipate. \n And when we think about -- you asked about the no credit check. And I can tell you, one, that we continue to see very healthy levels of bad debt. We continue to actually be the leader compared to our peers in terms of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue. So we're very happy with what we see there. \n We're always testing and trying new things. For example, we have a way and an ability for prepaid customers who have a certain number of on-time payments to graduate into postpaid without an incremental credit check. And that's because we have data and know exactly how those customers behave over time and what the really data informed credit risk around those consumers are. So we're always going to be testing around edges what is really beneficial for consumers while being very thoughtful around, of course, risk protection for the entity, and that's why we sit at the bad debt rates that we do. \nG. Sievert: And that's not new. We've had that program in place for many years. \nPeter Osvaldik: Of course, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. \nCraig Moffett: Is there any risk, though, that ACP customers who've been essentially getting their bills paid by the government and therefore have good credit histories might be higher credit risk as ACP ends? \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. You're absolutely right, and that's thoughtful around -- remember, as Mike Katz said, the amount of ACP customers that are sitting in our prepaid base and Metro is very small. So that's a very small exposure. \nG. Sievert: And the amount in the postpaid base... \nPeter Osvaldik: Zero. Postpaid is absolutely 0 for us. And so it's really finding products. And you saw us probably launch out there some ways to help consumers and think about can you get into other programs like T-Mobile Connect or other low-cost opportunities or Lifeline type of construct. So look, we're going to be very thoughtful around making sure customers in this critical category stay connected while being, of course, very thoughtful around the risk profile to T-Mobile. \nG. Sievert: Yes. As Mike pointed out, it's not just our customers that are facing this, right? Everybody else is. But we've got this incredible portfolio of brands that are famous for value. And we're going to make sure that those brands are in front of people because we're going to stand up and serve them at a time when they might find that they need a new offer, and we will be there with incredible offers for them. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. \nJonathan Chaplin: Congratulations to Jud and Cathy. That's fantastic news. Since it's Jud's last call, I've got 9 questions to ask. I'll try and consolidate them. So Mike, I'm wondering if you can give us just an update on the sort of the fiber strategies that you're collecting together in aggregate. So you've announced so far pilot, the Lumos deal. I think there are deals out there with Tillman, Intrepid and SiFi. How many -- when you put all of those together, how many homes passed does it amount to? \n And for the Lumos deal specifically, can you -- how much cash is EQT putting in? We're just trying to get a sense of sort of the total capitalization here. And then how much comes from sort of incremental debt? And then my last question on this is, how do you see -- all of the deals that we've had about so far seem to be focused on guys building new infrastructure. How about -- how do you think about those sorts of assets versus partnering with guys who have existing copper infrastructure that they're upgrading? \nG. Sievert: You bet. We won't be able to give you too much on sort of broad strategy here other than the fact that we're opportunistic. The strategies we've employed so far, both across wholesale, which we got started on in a very small way already, as well as this new partnership, are about putting the T-Mobile brand and team to work, selling a fiber product that complements our wildly successful 5G product. And to us, that's a great strategy because we believe we have an opportunity to generate superior returns than a purely disinterested investor could do by virtue of our assets and our know-how. And we've proven that know-how to ourselves through our success with 5G Home Internet. \n You think about our incredible distribution, our leading brand, our tens of millions of customers, our incredible team. We have very insightful data that our customers give us permission to use to put relevant offers about their T-Mobile experience in front of them. These are all advantages that are purely financial or disinterested investor wouldn't have. And so when we look at this area and say, can we extract a return that's better than others could, we have some confidence. And so we think about it from that opportunistic standpoint, not from a convergence defensive standpoint. \n We believe that our T-Mobile offers stand tall and stand alone and don't \"need\" convergence. We just think that this is a place where we can make customers happy and generate a superior financial return and that it complements a leadership product that we already have out there. Beyond that, I can't say much more about the strategy other than what I said earlier. We like this partnership. We're very excited about where it could go. \n Maybe Peter can comment on the capital structure. But one of the things I do like about it is that we decided as we formed this to fund it and give it the wherewithal with some additional debt to have everything it needs from an equity standpoint to get to the 3.5 million homes passed, which we think is a nice threshold for us. It will be a multistate footprint. It will be big enough to matter. And of course, that will be through a combination of debt and equity. \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes. And again, Jon, I can't give you all the details because we have counterparties involved in this. First, it is a 50-50 joint venture. It will be unconsolidated for us. So it's an equity method investment for us. So everybody kind of captures that fine point. And then as Mike said, there -- just given that it's a 50-50, there will be, obviously, cash infusion from EQT as a partner in this as well. \n And when you think about that incremental 500 million, for example, that would be an equivalent cash infusion from EQT. And there is -- given this is an infrastructure and a great anchor tenant in the form of T-Mobile having the retail customers, there is an ability to also lever the entity up. And the overarching thought process is this is about a maximum of 2:1 debt-to-equity ratio, but it will be based on what the funding needs of the entity actually is to get to that 3.5 million. \nJonathan Chaplin: One quick follow-up, Peter, if I can. You mentioned at the beginning that you sort of set capital aside for things like this in 2024. You haven't used up that whole sort of reservoir of capital yet. If you look at what's left there, is it more directed towards fiber transactions like this or spectrum? Like how do you sort of balance between those 2 assets? \nPeter Osvaldik: It really is looking at what the best return profile for T-Mobile is. And sometimes, as you know, spectrum opportunities may come up. They may not come up. We could have some of the 2.5-gig leased spectrum come up, and then we have rights of first refusal around those. So it's still a balance. We don't have line of sight to how we would use every dollar of what's still remaining in that bucket. But as opportunities come up, we're going to tumble it through the normal capital allocation thought process that we have that we've described very many times, and that's exactly how you think we should think about it. \nG. Sievert: And nor should we, right? So I mean one of the reasons why we were this transparent, maybe unusually transparent with you, is that we wanted you to know that we could, in the normal course, pursue opportunities and yet still honor our stockholder return ambitions. And we wanted to make it clear that, that -- nothing has changed in that. \n And that's why we put an envelope out there at the beginning so that you would have confidence that whether it was spectrum, partnerships like this, other things that we would see that we could use our know-how and embedded assets to be able to extract a superior financial return and delight customers that we would have the wherewithal to seize those things within that range. So we're really pleased to have been able to bring this one to fruition and can't wait to get started once we get approval. \nOperator: And the next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. \nSimon Flannery: Great. And best of luck, Jud. Thanks for all the help. And welcome, Cathy. Peter, I wanted to talk a little bit about margins, if I could. You had nice EBITDA growth of 8%, margins up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year. I think in the past, you sort of suggested the cadence would kind of ramp through the year. So perhaps just talk a little bit about margin trajectory, both this year and just longer term, the opportunity? I think, Mike, you said we're just getting started here. So talk about the cost side, if you could. And then maybe on spectrum, just any update you can give us on the status of the 800-megahertz spectrum. Given we passed the DISH April 1 deadline, what should we expect in coming months from you in terms of auctioning that off to third parties? \nG. Sievert: You take the first one, and I'll take the second. \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Simon. It's a tremendously exciting story, actually. One of the reasons, as we've talked about before, is we've now achieved as of Q4 of last year, in this tremendously successful merger integration, the run rate synergies, which we raised a couple of times during the pendency of the deal and execution itself. And so now though, we continue with this guide to see run rates EBITDA increases that are significant, in fact, quite similar to what we had during those synergy unlock days. And there's a couple of things that create that. \n One is continued outsized profitable share taking, of course, taking those fixed costs and leveraging the fact that we're continuing to take outsized share and turning that into outsized service revenue growth. So when you have postpaid service revenue growth like we delivered this quarter of 6.5% year-over-year on a lot of fixed cost nature of the base, that obviously gives you leverage. Besides that, we're going to continue. And really, it's a culture. It's kind of a flow of thinking here that we have around continued optimization efficiencies, where can we extract efficiency out of the business so that we can plow it back into customer acquisition, margin expansion. \n And most importantly, and we've talked about this, we tend to think about it as service revenue to free cash flow conversion. That free cash flow is what unlocks all the ability for further value-creating investments, whether it's spectrum purchases, whether it's capital returns. \n And so we're hyper-focused on how do we make sure that we create efficiencies in the expense profiles and how do we make sure that in our CapEx profile, we're making every single dollar count and delivering the next best tranche of value for us. And I think we have some really bespoke unique ways that we approach that. But that's how we continue to see this expansion, particularly in that service revenue to free cash flow play out over a period of time. \nG. Sievert: I hope it doesn't sound like we're sort of flogging our book when we say we look at cash flow margins. We are. But also, I think cash is king, and a view that doesn't look at cash flow margins would miss the fact that we have, we think, a durably more capital-efficient strategy than our benchmark competitors. And therefore, from a geography standpoint, EBITDA margins don't tell the whole story, even though I'm pleased we're up 200 bps almost, and we're making great progress there. But the cash margins are the story because they are inclusive of what we think is a durably superior capital investment profile. And we'll talk a lot more about what we think our secret sauce is with you at some point when we have more time. But this is a strategy we have growing confidence in that it's going to be durable. \n Okay. So the second question around 800. Well, first of all, I will just remind you what Peter, I know, has told people in the past, that we've chosen our business plan to be pretty conservative as it relates to how to think about the 800. And what I mean by that is we didn't include any proceeds from this auction in our financial plan so that they would be found money going into that reserve fund. We were talking about a few minutes ago with Jonathan. \n But secondly, we also did not put the usage of that spectrum into our network planning and capacity plan. And so kind of no matter what happens here with this auction, which has begun. We either get found spectrum and capacity that we get to keep and figure out a way to use. And this is a great spectrum, nationwide, contiguous low band, lots of interesting things we can do with it, especially with emerging technologies. But also, this action may conclude successfully. And if it does, we'll have cash on hand that enhances our profile. \n So what's the update? We have commenced. We have interested parties. We have nonbinding indications of interest. There's reason to believe that we will meet the reserve. So it's a little too soon. Everything is nonbinding, but we'll have more to say after we get past kind of the binding parts of this. So stay tuned. But again, whichever way it shakes out for us, it's a win because of our conservative planning. \nOperator: The next question is from David Barden with Bank of America. \nDavid Barden: Perfect. Congrats to Jud and Cathy. So I guess my first question would be related to the comments in the results about how kind of going after the business market has kind of impacted the ARPU calculation, and that's been trending down for a couple of quarters. And so I was wondering if you could kind of maybe unpack the kind of subscriber number that we're watching evolve here and how it balances between consumer versus business. Obviously, I'm obligated to ask you how free lines and other things contribute to the reported postpaid number. \n And the second question, if I could, maybe, Mike, just to go back to this Lumos situation. You're basically saying that today, you're prepared to invest about $1.45 billion between now and 2028 to own 50% of basically 2.5% of the households in America. And if you got 50% of that, you would have slightly around under -- between 1% and 1.5%. So what is the point? Like why is it worth the brain damage to spend the money, the years building the organization to get something that looks realistically so small in the grand scheme? \nG. Sievert: Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me start with the second one, and then I'll hand it to Peter on the first one. Look, I'm really excited about this because I think we're getting a lot and enabling this company to accelerate growth. And if you think about close to $1.5 billion spread over in time, 3.5 million passings being the goal for that funding, from what we -- the capital we put out, that's less than $500 per passing. And to the premise of the question, that's not for sort of like half of it because the other way it works is that T-Mobile is the branded entity for all of those passings. And it's up to us to make sure that it stays that way and we perform and so on. \n But our strategy is to be able to get augmentations to an already nationwide multimillion customer broadband strategy. And this is a smart way to do that. And I signaled we're open to constructs like this around the margins. And so maybe in the end, it'll add up to more than this, and certainly, 3.5 million isn't where this probably ends. This is a growth engine that could continue into the future. We're not obligated for it, too. \n So I love the strategy. And I think it's about getting a better return based on our embedded assets and complementing a complementary product that's already scaled, and that makes it very appealing for us to think about the efficiencies of how we would go to market. And we are the go-to-market entity in this construct as Lumos pivots into a wholesale model. So hopefully, that helps. \n To your first question on ARPU, maybe you could unpack it a little bit vis-a-vis business versus consumer and then answer once again the age-old question of free lines and all that stuff. \nPeter Osvaldik: Yes, absolutely. And Dave, as we've been long saying, our focus is primarily on ARPA, drive accounts, land them, expand them. And we just gave an updated guide with respect to ARPA, both from that as well as those continued rate plan optimization. And we'll probably see that more unfold in the second half of the year. But that trickles down into ARPU as well. So I'd say probably this year, we're expecting ARPU to be up, say, maybe 0.5%, again, more weighted to the second half of the year. But it is very much, as you say, a mix-driven metric. \n And now we don't separately disclose consumer versus business, but there's just so much goodness in terms of ARPA, both accounts and ARPA accretion, that you would expect us to go heavily after, as Callie was talking about, the enterprise space and the government space where naturally, ARPUs are lower. But account and CLVs and enterprise value creation is really great and strong. So you see success in -- even in the consumer space with segmented consumer offers like in the 55-plus segment in the military segment. Once again, we're willing to do lower ARPUs because you have great CLVs with those types of customers for differential reasons each in their own segment. So we're going to continue to pursue this strategy. But again, now we expect about probably 0.5% increase in ARPU. \n Now this whole age-old free line question, I understand because there's some stuff that's happening in the industry. As you know, we don't do first free lines. Now we've long had a construct in our rate plan constructs that encourages higher number of lines in terms of our accounts because the higher number of lines get to be more sticky, generate more ARPA and greater lifetime value. \n But there's really been no trajectory change there at all from a year-over-year sequential perspective. In fact, I would say it contributed less this Q1 than it did last Q1. But that to me is very much a rate plan construct. And again, we don't do first free lines. And so that's kind of -- it's not really any sort of a contributor to what you see have happened year-over-year in terms of our net add performance relative to the industry. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Eric Luebchow with Wells Fargo. \nEric Luebchow: Great. Just a follow-up on the fiber-to-the-home strategy at a high level. As you look at potential future opportunities, is the goal to target areas where you might be underpenetrated in either fixed wireless or traditional mobile to kind of expand your addressable market? Or is it in part to provide an alternative for existing FWA subs to offload to a higher capacity option? Any color there would be helpful. \n And then secondly, just on the network positioning today, maybe you could talk about how you're sequencing capital to put additional spectrum to work between C-band, the DoD spectrum, 2.5 gigahertz, refarming AWS. Just anything -- any color you could provide on how you're working to maintain your network advantage, particularly as your 2 large peers have made further progress in building out mid-band spectrum. \nG. Sievert: Sounds good. Let's start with the second one about network. I mean I am really pleased with what is happening with Ulf and team. We continue to actually extend our lead. If you look nationwide, don't look at somebody's favorite denominator, but just look nationwide at all of the customers and all of the experience that all the customers are having. We're actually pulling ahead, and our average speeds are double our competitive benchmarks. \n And so -- and one of the reasons for this is that it's not just looking underneath the 5G, but it's looking at the availability of that 5G that for us is in so many more places reaching so many more people. And with that full layer cake, which keeps the customers connected to 5G, all that results in a fantastic experience. Maybe you can give a little color on what's been unfolding, talk about Auction 108 and how we're deploying advanced technologies, Ulf. \nUlf Ewaldsson: Well, thank you, Mike. And yes, we're very excited about the network and how it keeps advancing. And you mentioned C-band. So some of our competitors have launched C-band and put it out there. And in the areas where they launched it, we do see that the gap between us and them narrowed a little bit even though we are still way ahead. But as you said, we also noticed that the overall median downlink speeds, we are gaining another quarter again. \n And the main reason for us doing that is really the unique way we've built and constructed the network. We are the only one in the country who has 3 completely dedicated bands towards 5G. We have 2.5. We have 1,900 now. And we have 600. And that gives us that big advantage together with the stand-alone network and the larger deployment in the footprint that we have. In fact, we have now 90% of our sites capable of 5G. We have, traffic-wise, about 85% of our traffic on these tri-band sites that are all working with stand-alone technology and working with carrier... \nG. Sievert: Let's talk more about that one. Somebody -- so 85% of the time, our people are attaching to a site with all 3 bands of 5G. And how does that affect the quality of the connection and the reliability of the 5G connection? \nUlf Ewaldsson: Well, very much so because out of that, we also have -- and this is an even more remarkable stat. We have 93% of the traffic on mid-band, which means that there is no toggling. It just creates a much more consistent experience. There is no toggling between when you're an LTE. In fact, you're staying in 5G the entire -- no targeting between low band and mid-band. So another factor of no toggling. \n The other one is that we have a grid, and this is a unique thing for T-Mobile. We have a grid that is based from the beginning on a mid-band experience. So when we deploy 2.5, we get a very consistent experience between our towers as opposed to some of our competitors who has a low-band grid and therefore -- and a higher band on the C-band. C-band is higher than 2.5. That creates a less -- more sort of interrupted, not so clear and consistent experience. \nG. Sievert: That's why we are differentiated with somebody experiencing a cell edge condition of 5G, right, because our grid is tighter and our spectrum reaches further. And the net effect of those 2 things is you're on 5G and a high-quality 5G link more of the time. And 85% of the time, you're seeing all 3 bands where a lot of the time, we use advanced carrier aggregation techniques so that you get the benefit of all those bands in terms of your signal strength like the uplink might be in the low band, the downlink might be in the mid-band, et cetera, et cetera. And these are all advanced techniques that the rollout with our competitors is quite variable. But we're really focused on giving everybody a consistent experience. \nUlf Ewaldsson: That's very right, Mike. And it's recognized. I mean we saw in the Ookla measurements another quarter where we came in at the overall network leader. We were also recognized by Opensignal as having the most reliable experience. So I think those are remarkable facts showing. \n And then you mentioned also our 108 auction and how quickly we deployed. It took us 2 weeks to get it all lit up in our entire network. Over a population of about 60 million, we were able to shoot up our 5G median linked speeds by about 20% or a little bit more even. So really a good result and very quickly and shows that we can deploy our spectrum very fast. \nG. Sievert: Well, thank you all for joining our fireside chat about network. And -- but I did want to make sure because there is this kind of misnomer out there that everybody is catching up and the party is over. And it's -- and I've been saying this for years. We remain 2 years ahead of the party on 5G, and our customers are having a radically differentiated experience. And you can see it in the data, not just in the rhetoric. So really glad you asked about that. \n Now there was another question, though, about fiber and where we intend to target. Look, I can't help you much on that because we don't have -- we're not rolling out a plan that this is the beginning of a big wave of initiatives here. We're really happy about this initiative and how it augments 5G broadband. And we intend to go put our energy into it. So -- but look, I do want to remind people that this isn't a regional thing for 5G Home Internet. It's really a sector-by-sector assessment, neighborhood by neighborhood as to where will we have excess capacity because that sector gets hung in order to give the kind of competitive experience that we were just coffee talking about. \n But then if mobile usage isn't predicted to soak up all that capacity, then individual households get approved for home broadband. And so now if those neighborhoods are neighborhoods where we roll out fiber, then we can actually have some of those neighbors be added to the 5G who wouldn't otherwise be added. And that's TAM expanding, potentially. But we're really focused on these things right now. Very happy to have this initiative out the door and nothing further to report about it. \nJud Henry: That was great. I'm sorry, I didn't bring my popcorn for that one. \nOperator: And the next question is from Sam McHugh with BNP Paribas. \nSamuel McHugh: Just on fiber to begin with, on the existing wholesale agreement you have, can you give us any color on what kind of penetration levels you're seeing kind of year 1, year 2, so we can think about the potential in the new JV? And then secondly, I think on FWA, I've seen some reports suggesting you might start selling notifications to people who move the products from the home address. Do you think that will have any impact on the kind of net adds going forward? And I guess more broadly, how should we think about that cadence of FWA through the rest of this year? \nG. Sievert: Thank you. And we'll go to Mike for both questions. \nMichael Katz: Yes. So first, on the fiber question. Remember, a lot of these wholesale markets that we've launched are brand new and haven't even been existing for a year. But when you heard Mike talking about the assets that T-Mobile has and how we think that those give us advantage relative to other investors, that is exactly what we're starting to see play out in these wholesale markets. Remember, at small scale, we're in parts of about 16 markets spread around the country. But what we're seeing is a pace that would get us over 20% in the first year inside those markets. So we're really pleased with the penetration that we're seeing there. \nG. Sievert: Now on your FWA question. And specifically, earlier this week, we launched a couple of new products. And let me just give a little bit of context to those. Mike talked about us moving over 5 million customers in our home broadband business this quarter, which obviously is a huge milestone for us. And we now sit at the center of millions of homes with the most important technology in their house. And we think that gives us an opportunity, and I think I've mentioned this in the last couple of calls, to look at opportunities to expand into other products and services inside the home as well as give us tons of insight from what we're hearing from customers of additional needs. \n So earlier this week, we launched a program called Whole Home, which gives customers the ability to -- in addition to the CPE and router that we provide in our regular HSI package, they can expand that and add mesh that integrates into our CPE. So they can give themselves a much larger WiFi footprint inside their home. We also include some additional support for all the peripheral devices that attach to your network. So if you've got a laptop or a printer that you need support on, we'll offer that as part of this program. \n And then secondly, we offered a new program called Away. And I'm really excited about this one because one of the things we've heard from customers is because this is a product that only requires power, we're not running a wire into your house or anything like that, it just requires power. And we see customers that want to use this on their boat or in their RV or while they're camping. And we created a couple of new plans specifically for those use cases that allow customers to move this as their life move along in their RV. \n The other thing I'm really excited about in combination with that is we struck a partnership with Camping World. And Camping World, if you're not familiar with them, is the largest camping and RV retailer in the country, and they're going to be partnering with us on these Away programs to sell to their customers and to integrate our HSI routers inside RVs that they sell. \nMichael Katz: And you can send your orders for our new Away product at mike.katz@... \nG. Sievert: By the way, you asked one last question, which is about what we're seeing with the wholesale fiber penetration rates. It's all very early because remember, these are greenfield projects. And so these were -- our partners were starting out after the wholesale partnerships were struck. But so far, so good. At a small scale, we're seeing year 1 penetration rates trending to 20%. That's above industry benchmarks. That's a good sign on your way to terminal penetration rates that are much higher than that. So everything we're seeing from these small scale so far anyway, it's going to grow. But so far, small-scale pilots in the wholesale range was very positive. And that's adding, of course, to our confidence to do news like today. So hopefully, that covers your question, Sam. \nSamuel McHugh: Just the cadence on FWA. \nG. Sievert: Cadence, tell me one more time what that part's about. \nSamuel McHugh: In terms of kind of net add development through the rest of the year. We've obviously seen some moves from T and others. Kind of how we should think about growth going forward. \nG. Sievert: We don't guide on it. But one thing we did do when we made the changes around sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions is we indicated that this quarter would be more like 400,000 instead of the 500,000 we've seen in the past. And that's what happened. We delivered 405,000. We haven't guided on the rest of the year, but we've said we're well on track to the goal that we have always anticipated being by the end of 2025 in that 7 million to 8 million customers range. \n And what's interesting is that 400,000 and 500,000 net additions this quarter actually represented, as I said in my prepared remarks, a higher percentage of total broadband net adds than last year's 500-and-some thousand. And so we're sticking right in there with a very competitive more than half, that means more than all the others combined, number of net adds in the space. And so we're really happy with where it is because at the same time, we're seeing the value of this customer base start to appreciate, and that's also important, not just through pricing or promotion sunsets but through the kinds of value-added services that Mike just summarized. \nJud Henry: Operator, let's squeeze in one question, please. \nOperator: And that question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. \nKannan Venkateshwar: Congratulations, Jud and Cathy, once more. Mike, I'm trying to maybe nudge you along a little bit more on your prior response on broadband. You now have scale in broadband, and you're already one of the biggest operators in this market through fixed wireless. But you seem to be hedging your comments a little bit on fiber in terms of the scale or the kind of ambitions that you might have here long term. So could you maybe talk about what the ultimate scale ambitions here are? Are you viewing this as a cheap option at this point and you want to test out the market a little bit to see where it goes? Or is there a longer-term vision behind this in terms of how you see the company as a whole evolving in terms of its business mix? \nG. Sievert: Yes, I can say a couple of things. And one of them -- and this will be a little unsatisfying, but I do plan to lay out a more long-term view on how we think about this space at our Capital Markets Day that I mentioned would be this fall because I know that people want a multiyear view. Even that view will include an element that we intend to be patient, opportunistic. And it will also include an element that says we have no interest in fundamentally changing who we are. We are a highly successful mobile business that's mobile-first that's generating superior cash flow returns in this industry because of our superior strategy. And we're embarked upon a shareholder return program that we think makes a lot of sense in this piece of our life. \n So look, we're going to -- we like this area for all the reasons I said on this call. But it's premature for us to lay out kind of a detailed strategy on where we expect to be. And even when I lay it out, there will be some element of it that you'll have to be patient with us because we're going to be patient. We're going to be smart. We're going to be opportunistic because we have so much confidence in our core strategy. And hopefully, you see that patience on our part as a sign of our confidence in our core business. \nJud Henry: Well, that's all the time we have for questions, and we definitely appreciate everyone joining us today. It's been an absolute privilege working with you. And if you have any additional questions, please reach out to either the Investor Relations or Media Relations departments. And with that, have a great day. \nG. Sievert: Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the T-Mobile First Quarter Earnings Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Osvaldik",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Mike. All right. As you can see, we kicked off 2024 with great momentum. Mike already highlighted our best-in-class growth in both the top and bottom line and how our industry-leading conversion of service revenue to adjusted free cash flow continues to differentiate T-Mobile. So let me jump into our updated expectations for how that growth will continue in 2024. \n Starting with customers, where we now expect total postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.2 million and 5.6 million, up 150,000 at the midpoint. We now expect full year postpaid ARPA to grow up to 3% in 2024, a further acceleration of the growth we saw in 2023 from both the continued execution of our strategy to win and expand account relationships and as we anticipate taking further rate plan optimization actions within the base. \n There is no change in our expectations for postpaid phone net adds from our original guidance last quarter with Q1's strong growth coming in as we expected and because we anticipate slight year-over-year headwinds to postpaid phone net adds in Q2 and Q3 related to those rate plan optimizations, which are accretive to the business on an all-in basis. \n Core adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $31.4 billion and $31.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year at the midpoint. And as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we expect our industry-leading service revenue growth to accelerate at a higher rate in 2024 than we delivered in 2023 even with the discontinuation of the Affordable Connectivity Program that appears imminent at this point in time and is contemplated within the increased guidance. We continue to expect cash CapEx to be between $8.6 billion and $9.4 billion as we deliver a capital efficiency unmatched in our industry on the back of our network integration and 5G leadership. \n Lastly, we now expect adjusted free cash flow, including payments for merger-related costs, to be in the range of $16.4 billion to $16.9 billion. This is up 23% over last year at the midpoint and 5x the expected growth rate of our next closest competitor, thanks to our margin expansion and capital efficiency and does not assume any material net cash inflows from securitization. This also represents an adjusted free cash flow to service revenue margin, which is multiple percentage points higher than peers. \n So in closing, we continue to expect 2024 to be another year of differentiated profitable growth as we continue to extend our network leadership and further scale our unique growth opportunities. We expect this to continue to translate into industry-leading growth in service revenue, core adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow along with the highest adjusted free cash flow margin in the industry, unlocking shareholder value. I couldn't be more excited about the continued enormous value creation opportunity that we have in front of us for years to come. \n Okay. Before we open it up for Q&A, I just want to take a moment to announce a changing of the guard in our Investor Relations leadership. After 11 years and an unbelievable 44 earnings cycles in IR, I'm tremendously excited for Jud to take on a broader role within our finance organization. And I'm equally excited to introduce Cathy Yao as our new SVP of Investor Relations. Many of you may know Cathy, from her time on the sell side at MoffettNathanson or on the corporate side at Altice USA among other roles on her fabulous resume. We look forward to Cathy continuing T-Mobile's strong tradition of Investor Relations excellence. \n And with that, I will now turn the call back to Jud to begin his last Q&A. Jud? I think you got it. Yes. And let me maybe add to that just a little bit on your other questions, Craig. And I think Mike really highlighted our thinking around this well. Of course, it's in front of us, more so than behind us. No new activations as of February, but it's in front of us, but we think it's fully baked into the guidance range that we gave you, the range of outcomes that we anticipate. \n And when we think about -- you asked about the no credit check. And I can tell you, one, that we continue to see very healthy levels of bad debt. We continue to actually be the leader compared to our peers in terms of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue. So we're very happy with what we see there. \n We're always testing and trying new things. For example, we have a way and an ability for prepaid customers who have a certain number of on-time payments to graduate into postpaid without an incremental credit check. And that's because we have data and know exactly how those customers behave over time and what the really data informed credit risk around those consumers are. So we're always going to be testing around edges what is really beneficial for consumers while being very thoughtful around, of course, risk protection for the entity, and that's why we sit at the bad debt rates that we do. Of course, yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Yes, absolutely. You're absolutely right, and that's thoughtful around -- remember, as Mike Katz said, the amount of ACP customers that are sitting in our prepaid base and Metro is very small. So that's a very small exposure. Zero. Postpaid is absolutely 0 for us. And so it's really finding products. And you saw us probably launch out there some ways to help consumers and think about can you get into other programs like T-Mobile Connect or other low-cost opportunities or Lifeline type of construct. So look, we're going to be very thoughtful around making sure customers in this critical category stay connected while being, of course, very thoughtful around the risk profile to T-Mobile. Yes. And again, Jon, I can't give you all the details because we have counterparties involved in this. First, it is a 50-50 joint venture. It will be unconsolidated for us. So it's an equity method investment for us. So everybody kind of captures that fine point. And then as Mike said, there -- just given that it's a 50-50, there will be, obviously, cash infusion from EQT as a partner in this as well. \n And when you think about that incremental 500 million, for example, that would be an equivalent cash infusion from EQT. And there is -- given this is an infrastructure and a great anchor tenant in the form of T-Mobile having the retail customers, there is an ability to also lever the entity up. And the overarching thought process is this is about a maximum of 2:1 debt-to-equity ratio, but it will be based on what the funding needs of the entity actually is to get to that 3.5 million. It really is looking at what the best return profile for T-Mobile is. And sometimes, as you know, spectrum opportunities may come up. They may not come up. We could have some of the 2.5-gig leased spectrum come up, and then we have rights of first refusal around those. So it's still a balance. We don't have line of sight to how we would use every dollar of what's still remaining in that bucket. But as opportunities come up, we're going to tumble it through the normal capital allocation thought process that we have that we've described very many times, and that's exactly how you think we should think about it. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Simon. It's a tremendously exciting story, actually. One of the reasons, as we've talked about before, is we've now achieved as of Q4 of last year, in this tremendously successful merger integration, the run rate synergies, which we raised a couple of times during the pendency of the deal and execution itself. And so now though, we continue with this guide to see run rates EBITDA increases that are significant, in fact, quite similar to what we had during those synergy unlock days. And there's a couple of things that create that. \n One is continued outsized profitable share taking, of course, taking those fixed costs and leveraging the fact that we're continuing to take outsized share and turning that into outsized service revenue growth. So when you have postpaid service revenue growth like we delivered this quarter of 6.5% year-over-year on a lot of fixed cost nature of the base, that obviously gives you leverage. Besides that, we're going to continue. And really, it's a culture. It's kind of a flow of thinking here that we have around continued optimization efficiencies, where can we extract efficiency out of the business so that we can plow it back into customer acquisition, margin expansion. \n And most importantly, and we've talked about this, we tend to think about it as service revenue to free cash flow conversion. That free cash flow is what unlocks all the ability for further value-creating investments, whether it's spectrum purchases, whether it's capital returns. \n And so we're hyper-focused on how do we make sure that we create efficiencies in the expense profiles and how do we make sure that in our CapEx profile, we're making every single dollar count and delivering the next best tranche of value for us. And I think we have some really bespoke unique ways that we approach that. But that's how we continue to see this expansion, particularly in that service revenue to free cash flow play out over a period of time. Yes, absolutely. And Dave, as we've been long saying, our focus is primarily on ARPA, drive accounts, land them, expand them. And we just gave an updated guide with respect to ARPA, both from that as well as those continued rate plan optimization. And we'll probably see that more unfold in the second half of the year. But that trickles down into ARPU as well. So I'd say probably this year, we're expecting ARPU to be up, say, maybe 0.5%, again, more weighted to the second half of the year. But it is very much, as you say, a mix-driven metric. \n And now we don't separately disclose consumer versus business, but there's just so much goodness in terms of ARPA, both accounts and ARPA accretion, that you would expect us to go heavily after, as Callie was talking about, the enterprise space and the government space where naturally, ARPUs are lower. But account and CLVs and enterprise value creation is really great and strong. So you see success in -- even in the consumer space with segmented consumer offers like in the 55-plus segment in the military segment. Once again, we're willing to do lower ARPUs because you have great CLVs with those types of customers for differential reasons each in their own segment. So we're going to continue to pursue this strategy. But again, now we expect about probably 0.5% increase in ARPU. \n Now this whole age-old free line question, I understand because there's some stuff that's happening in the industry. As you know, we don't do first free lines. Now we've long had a construct in our rate plan constructs that encourages higher number of lines in terms of our accounts because the higher number of lines get to be more sticky, generate more ARPA and greater lifetime value. \n But there's really been no trajectory change there at all from a year-over-year sequential perspective. In fact, I would say it contributed less this Q1 than it did last Q1. But that to me is very much a rate plan construct. And again, we don't do first free lines. And so that's kind of -- it's not really any sort of a contributor to what you see have happened year-over-year in terms of our net add performance relative to the industry."

            "name": "Jon Freier",
            "content": "Yes, you bet. So I'll tell you a little bit about what's happening competitively. It's been an intense competitive environment in the marketplace, but it's been generally consistent as you look at this overall competitive intensity. And for our business, we continue to have these differentiated growth opportunities, whether that be smaller markets and rural areas, whether that be within our high-speed Internet or in our overall enterprise and government space that Callie can talk about in just a few moments as well. And so during that overall competitive context, we have these unique growth vectors that we continue to be underpenetrated on, driving a lot of good success so far but continue to have a lot of runway in front of us. \n So while that competitive environment is intense, sometimes one competitor is leaning in. Sometimes one competitor is leaning out. We're always navigating that. Things are always changing. Sometimes it's a little bit more device oriented. Sometimes it might be more rate oriented in terms of how the competitive environment is unfolding. But we've navigated that for years and years now and continue to be very comfortable with how that overall competitive environment is playing out. \n With respect to upgrades, we continue to meet the natural demand of upgrades. As you can see, the upgrade rate is a low 2.4% at the same time when we're matching the best Q1 postpaid phone churn performance in the company's history. We've been more targeted than surgical with some of our upgrade offers, for sure. But the overall natural demand and the upgrade cycle is lengthening. It's really kind of the best of both worlds when you have customers that are staying at incredible rates, record low rates and not staying for free devices exclusively. They're staying for this differentiated value proposition, the network and the overall experience, something we're very, very pleased with how it's unfolding."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Craig. First, to answer the first part of your question on what our expectations are with ACP, at this point, we're expecting that the program funding is going to end. And the impact of that is fully contemplated in the guidance that Peter talked about and shared earlier. \n And as a reminder, I think it's important to contextualize like how T-Mobile has participated in the ACP program. First of all, we have not participated in any form in postpaid across any products. It's nonexistent in our postpaid business. We have a small amount. I think we've said a couple of hundred thousand inside of our prepaid, our owned prepaid portfolio. And the vast amount of our participation is inside wholesale via wholesale partners that we work with. So for -- so just to contextualize where our participation is. \n That being said, we are both in the small amount that we have in our own prepaid business but also with the wholesale partners, working with them on communication and plans to help those customers transition. We think wireless is not a category that customers are going to walk away from. So these customers need another alternative, and we're working closely with the partners and with the customers to find them another alternative, whether it's other plans or other programs like Lifeline. So we're deep in doing that. \n And look, like we think if you look at T-Mobile, and Mike talked a lot about our passion around and focus around guarding our value position and the brands in our portfolio like Metro and soon to be Mint, these are all value brands that are focused on delivering value. And we think that's a great opportunity, both to help customers inside of our wholesale partners to transition, but honestly, customers that also may feel stranded from competitors to come to find a value to continue their wireless services. So I hope that's helpful for the question you're answering. Yes. So first, on the fiber question. Remember, a lot of these wholesale markets that we've launched are brand new and haven't even been existing for a year. But when you heard Mike talking about the assets that T-Mobile has and how we think that those give us advantage relative to other investors, that is exactly what we're starting to see play out in these wholesale markets. Remember, at small scale, we're in parts of about 16 markets spread around the country. But what we're seeing is a pace that would get us over 20% in the first year inside those markets. So we're really pleased with the penetration that we're seeing there. And you can send your orders for our new Away product at mike.katz@..."

            "content": "Well, thanks, [ John ], for the question. We saw very strong growth in Q1, outpacing our benchmark competitor again in postpaid phone nets. And to comment a little bit on the question that Jon was answering in the business category if we're seeing pressure in that category, I think it might be us. And one of the interesting things, I think, that's going on in our business right now is that not only are we delivering on top line growth but also on CLV growth across all segments. \n And in enterprise, we just delivered our strongest postpaid nets ever in the history of the company. We also delivered our lowest churn in enterprise. In SMB, we had our highest ever port ratios, and we're net positive for 7 consecutive quarters. So we're really liking the pace of the business. We've really graduated from just being a price comp to really a solution-oriented sale for customers. And we see that with partnerships with Dialpad Ai with delivering mission-critical push-to-talk. \n And I know, [ John ], you also asked who are some of the partners that we're working with in building our ecosystem. Obviously, we're partnering with the largest OEMs, working with Ericsson and Cisco as well as industry segment experts like [ OCS ] when it comes to serve our government customers. So really building out our ecosystem that allows us to really focus on enterprise solutions, enabling them to innovate and to love their customers at scale. \n I will mention just a couple of key wins in the Advanced Network Solution business. You might have read about our partnership agreement with Delta, where they named us as their preferred wireless provider. But we're also deploying a 5G hybrid network solution at their Atlanta headquarters, which we're really excited about. Also the U.S. Coast Guard is working with us build out a private network to deliver seamless secure connectivity from ship to shore. And then with Ericsson, not only as a strategic partner, but we're also working with them to deploy our first network slice on a SIM-based SASE solution within a 5G connected laptop. So we're really excited about the kinds of solutions, the sort of enterprises that we're bringing on and the momentum in the business overall. Yes. Thank you, Mike. Totally agree."

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Jud. Good afternoon, everybody. Welcome. If you're watching online, you can see that I've got a good part of the senior team here. We're coming to you from Bellevue, Washington today, and we're looking forward to a great discussion. \n And as you can see from our Q1 results, we are off to a great start in 2024. The year is unfolding right in line with what we expected across the board, and in fact, better in some areas, and we're increasing our guidance for the year accordingly. I'll briefly touch on a few highlights, and then we'll get right to your questions. \n First, a comment on growth. We continue to take share in Q1 just as expected with postpaid phone net adds that were right in line with Q1 last year, while industry net adds were lower by a double-digit percentage. Our best value, best network proposition continues to resonate in the market with our postpaid phone gross adds up year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter even while industry gross adds were down. And we matched our best ever Q1 postpaid phone churn, showing that customers love the Un-carrier value proposition and network.\n Second, a comment on those lowest ever postpaid upgrades for phones in Q1. I think this metric showcases our ongoing winning formula by demonstrating that customers choose to stay with T-Mobile for the best-in-class value and network they enjoy, which is the only retention strategy that drives profitable growth over the long term. The network is an increasingly powerful part of our customers' loyalty as 3/4 of our postpaid phone customers already have a 5G smartphone, and they're having a differentiated experience on the T-Mobile network. It also demonstrates how we put our investments where they can have the greatest customer impact, letting natural customer demand drive the pace of upgrades. \n Overall, from consumers in major metros to smaller markets and businesses from large enterprises to SMBs, T-Mobile's durable, differentiated growth momentum continues across the segments. And the most exciting part is that there are still many years of market-leading growth runway ahead for our core business. \n Okay. Let's talk broadband. Home broadband customers love a great value on a great network, too. That's been the formula that's made us the fastest-growing broadband provider for the past 2 years. And we did it again in Q1 as our 405,000 nets are expected to represent a higher share of industry broadband net adds than even a year ago and are expected to be more than half of all nets from the major providers once again. Our broadband strategy is unfolding exactly the way we said it would. And we now proudly serve over 5 million high-speed Internet customers.\n And as we previously announced, we're also growing the value of that customer base, successfully sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions and attracting customers at our nominal price points. In addition, our new rate plans for home mesh networks and for on-the-go usage are just the latest ways we intend to continue to enhance the value of this space and find new ways to serve customers better. \n Okay. Let me comment on fiber. I've been saying for a while that smart fiber partnerships would allow us to profitably serve even more broadband customers. And today, we announced a joint venture with EQT that will acquire Lumos. Consistent with everything we've said for the last year, this JV is the latest example of a capital-light model, and we're excited to have such great and experienced partners. EQT is one of the leading infrastructure investors across the U.S. and Europe and brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. \n The Lumos management team under Brian Stading is outstanding and has years of experience building fiber in an efficient, cost-effective and targeted build model. We're really excited to be able to accelerate what Lumos has already been doing to reach more and more households in the years ahead.\n Together, we target 3.5 million homes passed by 2028, and T-Mobile expects to invest about $950 million upon close, which we expect less than a year from now, and another $500 million between 2027 and '28 to get there. T-Mobile will be a 50% owner of Lumos and will own the customer relationships, including their existing fiber customers at close, as Lumos will convert to a wholesale model. \n This is exactly the type of value-creating investment that we had contemplated with our strategic envelope of funds that we set aside back when we shared the current stockholder return program with you last fall. And we expect to remain on track as it relates to our stockholder return ambitions. \n Lastly, I am so happy to report that we have received regulatory approval to acquire Mint and Ultra Mobile. And we, therefore, currently expect to close on May 1. We are really looking forward to welcoming them to the Un-carrier family. And I know they're going to fit in because they are hyper-focused on offering customers compelling products at a great value. We'll work to further fuel their success while also learning from their team who are absolute rock stars in the direct-to-consumer and value segments. \n Financially, in Q1, we again showed how T-Mobile translates profitable growth into market-leading consolidated service revenue growth and core adjusted EBITDA growth that was double the rate of our principal competitors. And T-Mobile again delivered the highest free cash flow margins in the industry. \n So to wrap up. Our model is working. It's consistent. And our confidence in it only builds with each passing quarter of success. We remain focused on continuing to take share in wireless and broadband while delivering industry-leading growth in service revenue, profitability and cash flows. I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead for T-Mobile. \n And I want you to know that we plan to have a Capital Markets Day this fall, where we look forward to going deeper with you on topics like the big opportunities that we see coming, how we're seizing them and how that will translate into enormous value creation for our company in the years ahead. And I think you're going to see once again that in many ways, we're just getting started. \n Okay. Peter, over to you to talk about our key financial highlights and an update on our guidance. Okay. Great. Well, why don't I jump in, and I'll give a comment on -- or a lack of a comment on the first question, and then I'll hand it to Jon Freier for the second one. No, we're not really going to announce any particular plans today. I will tell you that nothing we do is going to question or challenge our long-standing strategy of being the value leader in this market. But surely, over the span of many years, what that means kind of changes over time. Costs have risen. Changes have happened in a broader industry context. And we're going to jealously guard that value leadership. And I think customers understand that if there are changes around the margins once every many years in a world where costs change, they'll understand and accept that. \n We've actually made changes here and there over the past 6 months. We've understood what that looks like and what that takes. And there may be more changes, particularly with older rate plans. But we're not here to announce anything. I will tell you that all the outcomes that we see from all of that on the customer side as well as on the ARPA side and on the EBITDA and revenue side are contained within the guidance that Peter just shared. Do you want to add anything in the first question before we go to the second one? Okay. Competitive context on up -- what are we seeing on upgrades? What's driving that? What's happening with the competition, Jon? I'll just add one last thing. As I said in my prepared remarks, 75% of our customers have 5G devices, and those customers are having a very differentiated experience with T-Mobile's lead in 5G. And we can talk more about that, I hope, during the call. I'm so pleased with what's happened. We continue to extend our lead. And so that -- the impetus when you're having a fantastic experience on your phone, to prematurely swap it out, just isn't there. And they'll do it in a stepwise way. They continue to do it. And you can tell we're upgrading people fast enough by the fact that all those people have 5G phones, which is right at or even above competitive benchmark. So our customers continue to upgrade at just the pace that we think is appropriate. Let's go straight to Callie. It's really interesting when you hear us talk about enterprise, how different it is from 4 or 5 years ago. I mean we were trying our best to sell SIMs to companies that would take meetings with us like the procurement department. And what's happened in this 5G strategy as it's unfolded is Callie and team have built solutions to some of the most pressing connectivity problems that enterprises of all kinds face. And suddenly, we're in strategic conversations because we have capabilities like network slicing, like SIM-based security and many other emerging 5G capabilities that are way out in front. \n And that's not just giving us revenues in those advanced 5G services, but it's also winning us all those smartphones that we used to struggle so hard and back then have to price so hard to win. So it's been this really nice evolution. And make no mistake, we love low prices, and we're going to be the value leader here. But today, we're solving some of the most complicated connectivity problems that enterprises and organizations face. And that is a great place to compete. Okay. Let's start with the second one. All along, if I remind all of our listeners, I know you know this, our fixed wireless strategy has always been about selling excess capacity, where we predict normal cell phone usage won't suck up that 5G capacity. And so this gives us the opportunity to serve broadband customers. And now at scale, we're serving millions and millions of them under this strategy. We had originally said we saw this strategy leading to about 7 million to 8 million total customers in terms of opportunity. We don't have any updates on that. I've said several times, we're working on thinking about examining ways that we could try to extend that, and we haven't drawn any conclusions yet. We have to make sure it's done in an economic way, and we have to make sure it's done in a way that customers will love, and they have a fantastic product experience. \n That being said, what's interesting about fiber, fiber can be a strategy that relieves some pressure on the 5G network and extend the TAM, if you think about it, right, because some customers will -- where we offer fiber in the future, will be able to naturally graduate up to fiber, which is really a totally separate category. And that obviously opens up an opportunity for their neighbor to then become a 5G customer. So there's some TAM expansion there. \n And then to your point, even in places where Lumos currently operates, we have a long wait list of people who applied. They put their address in our system. They applied to be a fixed wireless customer, and we haven't accepted them yet because their address isn't one of those places that I described where we have the predicted excess capacity. So there's lots of opportunity there. \n As it relates to your first question around is this the first of many, et cetera, look, we don't have anything to say about that other than our strategy is to opportunistically find ways that are very capital-light, very smart to put our brand in this space, and we've done that here. And we think this will lead to millions of homes passed. And that's a great place for us to be. We're going to continue to learn, grow, expand. And we're open-minded about this. But we're not interested in any wholesale changes that basically change who we are. \n No big on-balance sheet acquisitions are currently being examined. It's not something that -- we know our investors like our fast, efficient, capital efficient, high capital return strategy, and we have no intentions of changing all that. That being said, if we can lay track for the long term in a very capital-efficient way, we're open-minded. And we really like this model that we've struck with EQT and Lumos, and can't wait to get started and get this approved through the regulatory bodies and begin to see this build out and accelerate. Well, let's start out with Mike Katz so we can disentangle some of these offers for you because there could be some misunderstanding out there. And then we'll go to Peter and talk about the financial, what we see in the financial picture as it relates to the expected turndown of ACP. And that's not new. We've had that program in place for many years. And the amount in the postpaid base... Yes. As Mike pointed out, it's not just our customers that are facing this, right? Everybody else is. But we've got this incredible portfolio of brands that are famous for value. And we're going to make sure that those brands are in front of people because we're going to stand up and serve them at a time when they might find that they need a new offer, and we will be there with incredible offers for them. You bet. We won't be able to give you too much on sort of broad strategy here other than the fact that we're opportunistic. The strategies we've employed so far, both across wholesale, which we got started on in a very small way already, as well as this new partnership, are about putting the T-Mobile brand and team to work, selling a fiber product that complements our wildly successful 5G product. And to us, that's a great strategy because we believe we have an opportunity to generate superior returns than a purely disinterested investor could do by virtue of our assets and our know-how. And we've proven that know-how to ourselves through our success with 5G Home Internet. \n You think about our incredible distribution, our leading brand, our tens of millions of customers, our incredible team. We have very insightful data that our customers give us permission to use to put relevant offers about their T-Mobile experience in front of them. These are all advantages that are purely financial or disinterested investor wouldn't have. And so when we look at this area and say, can we extract a return that's better than others could, we have some confidence. And so we think about it from that opportunistic standpoint, not from a convergence defensive standpoint. \n We believe that our T-Mobile offers stand tall and stand alone and don't \"need\" convergence. We just think that this is a place where we can make customers happy and generate a superior financial return and that it complements a leadership product that we already have out there. Beyond that, I can't say much more about the strategy other than what I said earlier. We like this partnership. We're very excited about where it could go. \n Maybe Peter can comment on the capital structure. But one of the things I do like about it is that we decided as we formed this to fund it and give it the wherewithal with some additional debt to have everything it needs from an equity standpoint to get to the 3.5 million homes passed, which we think is a nice threshold for us. It will be a multistate footprint. It will be big enough to matter. And of course, that will be through a combination of debt and equity. And nor should we, right? So I mean one of the reasons why we were this transparent, maybe unusually transparent with you, is that we wanted you to know that we could, in the normal course, pursue opportunities and yet still honor our stockholder return ambitions. And we wanted to make it clear that, that -- nothing has changed in that. \n And that's why we put an envelope out there at the beginning so that you would have confidence that whether it was spectrum, partnerships like this, other things that we would see that we could use our know-how and embedded assets to be able to extract a superior financial return and delight customers that we would have the wherewithal to seize those things within that range. So we're really pleased to have been able to bring this one to fruition and can't wait to get started once we get approval. You take the first one, and I'll take the second. I hope it doesn't sound like we're sort of flogging our book when we say we look at cash flow margins. We are. But also, I think cash is king, and a view that doesn't look at cash flow margins would miss the fact that we have, we think, a durably more capital-efficient strategy than our benchmark competitors. And therefore, from a geography standpoint, EBITDA margins don't tell the whole story, even though I'm pleased we're up 200 bps almost, and we're making great progress there. But the cash margins are the story because they are inclusive of what we think is a durably superior capital investment profile. And we'll talk a lot more about what we think our secret sauce is with you at some point when we have more time. But this is a strategy we have growing confidence in that it's going to be durable. \n Okay. So the second question around 800. Well, first of all, I will just remind you what Peter, I know, has told people in the past, that we've chosen our business plan to be pretty conservative as it relates to how to think about the 800. And what I mean by that is we didn't include any proceeds from this auction in our financial plan so that they would be found money going into that reserve fund. We were talking about a few minutes ago with Jonathan. \n But secondly, we also did not put the usage of that spectrum into our network planning and capacity plan. And so kind of no matter what happens here with this auction, which has begun. We either get found spectrum and capacity that we get to keep and figure out a way to use. And this is a great spectrum, nationwide, contiguous low band, lots of interesting things we can do with it, especially with emerging technologies. But also, this action may conclude successfully. And if it does, we'll have cash on hand that enhances our profile. \n So what's the update? We have commenced. We have interested parties. We have nonbinding indications of interest. There's reason to believe that we will meet the reserve. So it's a little too soon. Everything is nonbinding, but we'll have more to say after we get past kind of the binding parts of this. So stay tuned. But again, whichever way it shakes out for us, it's a win because of our conservative planning. Yes. Thanks, David. Well, let me start with the second one, and then I'll hand it to Peter on the first one. Look, I'm really excited about this because I think we're getting a lot and enabling this company to accelerate growth. And if you think about close to $1.5 billion spread over in time, 3.5 million passings being the goal for that funding, from what we -- the capital we put out, that's less than $500 per passing. And to the premise of the question, that's not for sort of like half of it because the other way it works is that T-Mobile is the branded entity for all of those passings. And it's up to us to make sure that it stays that way and we perform and so on. \n But our strategy is to be able to get augmentations to an already nationwide multimillion customer broadband strategy. And this is a smart way to do that. And I signaled we're open to constructs like this around the margins. And so maybe in the end, it'll add up to more than this, and certainly, 3.5 million isn't where this probably ends. This is a growth engine that could continue into the future. We're not obligated for it, too. \n So I love the strategy. And I think it's about getting a better return based on our embedded assets and complementing a complementary product that's already scaled, and that makes it very appealing for us to think about the efficiencies of how we would go to market. And we are the go-to-market entity in this construct as Lumos pivots into a wholesale model. So hopefully, that helps. \n To your first question on ARPU, maybe you could unpack it a little bit vis-a-vis business versus consumer and then answer once again the age-old question of free lines and all that stuff. Sounds good. Let's start with the second one about network. I mean I am really pleased with what is happening with Ulf and team. We continue to actually extend our lead. If you look nationwide, don't look at somebody's favorite denominator, but just look nationwide at all of the customers and all of the experience that all the customers are having. We're actually pulling ahead, and our average speeds are double our competitive benchmarks. \n And so -- and one of the reasons for this is that it's not just looking underneath the 5G, but it's looking at the availability of that 5G that for us is in so many more places reaching so many more people. And with that full layer cake, which keeps the customers connected to 5G, all that results in a fantastic experience. Maybe you can give a little color on what's been unfolding, talk about Auction 108 and how we're deploying advanced technologies, Ulf. Let's talk more about that one. Somebody -- so 85% of the time, our people are attaching to a site with all 3 bands of 5G. And how does that affect the quality of the connection and the reliability of the 5G connection? That's why we are differentiated with somebody experiencing a cell edge condition of 5G, right, because our grid is tighter and our spectrum reaches further. And the net effect of those 2 things is you're on 5G and a high-quality 5G link more of the time. And 85% of the time, you're seeing all 3 bands where a lot of the time, we use advanced carrier aggregation techniques so that you get the benefit of all those bands in terms of your signal strength like the uplink might be in the low band, the downlink might be in the mid-band, et cetera, et cetera. And these are all advanced techniques that the rollout with our competitors is quite variable. But we're really focused on giving everybody a consistent experience. Well, thank you all for joining our fireside chat about network. And -- but I did want to make sure because there is this kind of misnomer out there that everybody is catching up and the party is over. And it's -- and I've been saying this for years. We remain 2 years ahead of the party on 5G, and our customers are having a radically differentiated experience. And you can see it in the data, not just in the rhetoric. So really glad you asked about that. \n Now there was another question, though, about fiber and where we intend to target. Look, I can't help you much on that because we don't have -- we're not rolling out a plan that this is the beginning of a big wave of initiatives here. We're really happy about this initiative and how it augments 5G broadband. And we intend to go put our energy into it. So -- but look, I do want to remind people that this isn't a regional thing for 5G Home Internet. It's really a sector-by-sector assessment, neighborhood by neighborhood as to where will we have excess capacity because that sector gets hung in order to give the kind of competitive experience that we were just coffee talking about. \n But then if mobile usage isn't predicted to soak up all that capacity, then individual households get approved for home broadband. And so now if those neighborhoods are neighborhoods where we roll out fiber, then we can actually have some of those neighbors be added to the 5G who wouldn't otherwise be added. And that's TAM expanding, potentially. But we're really focused on these things right now. Very happy to have this initiative out the door and nothing further to report about it. Thank you. And we'll go to Mike for both questions. Now on your FWA question. And specifically, earlier this week, we launched a couple of new products. And let me just give a little bit of context to those. Mike talked about us moving over 5 million customers in our home broadband business this quarter, which obviously is a huge milestone for us. And we now sit at the center of millions of homes with the most important technology in their house. And we think that gives us an opportunity, and I think I've mentioned this in the last couple of calls, to look at opportunities to expand into other products and services inside the home as well as give us tons of insight from what we're hearing from customers of additional needs. \n So earlier this week, we launched a program called Whole Home, which gives customers the ability to -- in addition to the CPE and router that we provide in our regular HSI package, they can expand that and add mesh that integrates into our CPE. So they can give themselves a much larger WiFi footprint inside their home. We also include some additional support for all the peripheral devices that attach to your network. So if you've got a laptop or a printer that you need support on, we'll offer that as part of this program. \n And then secondly, we offered a new program called Away. And I'm really excited about this one because one of the things we've heard from customers is because this is a product that only requires power, we're not running a wire into your house or anything like that, it just requires power. And we see customers that want to use this on their boat or in their RV or while they're camping. And we created a couple of new plans specifically for those use cases that allow customers to move this as their life move along in their RV. \n The other thing I'm really excited about in combination with that is we struck a partnership with Camping World. And Camping World, if you're not familiar with them, is the largest camping and RV retailer in the country, and they're going to be partnering with us on these Away programs to sell to their customers and to integrate our HSI routers inside RVs that they sell. By the way, you asked one last question, which is about what we're seeing with the wholesale fiber penetration rates. It's all very early because remember, these are greenfield projects. And so these were -- our partners were starting out after the wholesale partnerships were struck. But so far, so good. At a small scale, we're seeing year 1 penetration rates trending to 20%. That's above industry benchmarks. That's a good sign on your way to terminal penetration rates that are much higher than that. So everything we're seeing from these small scale so far anyway, it's going to grow. But so far, small-scale pilots in the wholesale range was very positive. And that's adding, of course, to our confidence to do news like today. So hopefully, that covers your question, Sam. Cadence, tell me one more time what that part's about. We don't guide on it. But one thing we did do when we made the changes around sunsetting our [ launch era ] promotions is we indicated that this quarter would be more like 400,000 instead of the 500,000 we've seen in the past. And that's what happened. We delivered 405,000. We haven't guided on the rest of the year, but we've said we're well on track to the goal that we have always anticipated being by the end of 2025 in that 7 million to 8 million customers range. \n And what's interesting is that 400,000 and 500,000 net additions this quarter actually represented, as I said in my prepared remarks, a higher percentage of total broadband net adds than last year's 500-and-some thousand. And so we're sticking right in there with a very competitive more than half, that means more than all the others combined, number of net adds in the space. And so we're really happy with where it is because at the same time, we're seeing the value of this customer base start to appreciate, and that's also important, not just through pricing or promotion sunsets but through the kinds of value-added services that Mike just summarized. Yes, I can say a couple of things. And one of them -- and this will be a little unsatisfying, but I do plan to lay out a more long-term view on how we think about this space at our Capital Markets Day that I mentioned would be this fall because I know that people want a multiyear view. Even that view will include an element that we intend to be patient, opportunistic. And it will also include an element that says we have no interest in fundamentally changing who we are. We are a highly successful mobile business that's mobile-first that's generating superior cash flow returns in this industry because of our superior strategy. And we're embarked upon a shareholder return program that we think makes a lot of sense in this piece of our life. \n So look, we're going to -- we like this area for all the reasons I said on this call. But it's premature for us to lay out kind of a detailed strategy on where we expect to be. And even when I lay it out, there will be some element of it that you'll have to be patient with us because we're going to be patient. We're going to be smart. We're going to be opportunistic because we have so much confidence in our core strategy. And hopefully, you see that patience on our part as a sign of our confidence in our core business. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Ulf Ewaldsson",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Mike. And yes, we're very excited about the network and how it keeps advancing. And you mentioned C-band. So some of our competitors have launched C-band and put it out there. And in the areas where they launched it, we do see that the gap between us and them narrowed a little bit even though we are still way ahead. But as you said, we also noticed that the overall median downlink speeds, we are gaining another quarter again. \n And the main reason for us doing that is really the unique way we've built and constructed the network. We are the only one in the country who has 3 completely dedicated bands towards 5G. We have 2.5. We have 1,900 now. And we have 600. And that gives us that big advantage together with the stand-alone network and the larger deployment in the footprint that we have. In fact, we have now 90% of our sites capable of 5G. We have, traffic-wise, about 85% of our traffic on these tri-band sites that are all working with stand-alone technology and working with carrier... Well, very much so because out of that, we also have -- and this is an even more remarkable stat. We have 93% of the traffic on mid-band, which means that there is no toggling. It just creates a much more consistent experience. There is no toggling between when you're an LTE. In fact, you're staying in 5G the entire -- no targeting between low band and mid-band. So another factor of no toggling. \n The other one is that we have a grid, and this is a unique thing for T-Mobile. We have a grid that is based from the beginning on a mid-band experience. So when we deploy 2.5, we get a very consistent experience between our towers as opposed to some of our competitors who has a low-band grid and therefore -- and a higher band on the C-band. C-band is higher than 2.5. That creates a less -- more sort of interrupted, not so clear and consistent experience. That's very right, Mike. And it's recognized. I mean we saw in the Ookla measurements another quarter where we came in at the overall network leader. We were also recognized by Opensignal as having the most reliable experience. So I think those are remarkable facts showing. \n And then you mentioned also our 108 auction and how quickly we deployed. It took us 2 weeks to get it all lit up in our entire network. Over a population of about 60 million, we were able to shoot up our 5G median linked speeds by about 20% or a little bit more even. So really a good result and very quickly and shows that we can deploy our spectrum very fast."
