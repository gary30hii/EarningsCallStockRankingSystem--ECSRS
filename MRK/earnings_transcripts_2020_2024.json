Q4 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Lara, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs; Frank Clyburn, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We've also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products. And the supplemental financials posted to our website include recapped 2020 quarters based on the reporting change we are announcing today. I would also like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2019 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. Before turning to our financial results and our future perspective, I'd like to make a few comments about this morning's other announcement. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decade. I thank all of my Merck colleagues for their extraordinary support throughout this period. We are making this leadership change to cure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth. Rob Davis is well prepared and well suited to help Merck capitalize on the many exciting opportunities before it as well as to take on the challenges that lie ahead. He and the Merck senior team will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck Board and I believe it is a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision-making as well as a strategic direction to Rob, who will assume the title of President in April, at which point our operating divisions, Human Health, Animal Health, Manufacturing and Research, will begin reporting to him. I will retire as CEO at the end of June but remain for some period of time as Executive Chairman to assist Rob, Dean, and the rest of the senior team. I am extremely confident in the capabilities and commitment of Merck's people and Rob's ability to guide the company to an even brighter future. Moving on to our results. Despite challenges from the pandemic, Merck achieved solid growth in revenues and earnings in 2020, made meaningful advancements in our pipeline and added important assets through business development. Despite the particular impact to our portfolio, the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong. And our initial guidance reflects our expectation for a return to strong growth this year, 2021. Looking out to 2024, we continue to believe our revenue potential is underappreciated. Longer term, the work we are doing in advancing our internal pipeline and in adding assets through business development gives us increasing line of sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next. I'm amazed by the dedication of our employees who rallied to keep supply uninterrupted, regulatory filings on track, and clinical and commercial execution in line with our goals. And I remain continually inspired by what Merck accomplishes for patients around the world. I'm also encouraged by the progress scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry have achieved in bringing vaccines to market that will help address the pandemic and start to return the world to normalcy. These successes further underscore the societal value of our industry's ongoing investments in science and innovation. Merck remains committed to developing an effective response to COVID-19 also. We have discontinued development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, but our therapeutic research programs continue to move forward. We believe that our oral antiviral candidate molnupiravir could make an important contribution to treating COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to seeing the results of our pivotal trials. More recently, we acquired OncoImmune and have accelerated the development of MK-7110, a Phase 3 candidate with strong potential in the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. I am encouraged by the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad late-stage pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV, and pneumococcal disease. We remain highly focused on business development to enhance our internal pipeline. We completed 120 transactions in total in 2020, including important acquisitions, such as OncoImmune, VelosBio, and ArQule and collaborations including CGEN and Ridgeback. Our plan to spin-off Organon remains on track for completion late in the second quarter. As independent, more focused company, I'm confident Merck and Organon will have the ability to more effectively pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategies to bring more value to patients and to shareholders. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the leaders of this company and how proud I am of the Merck team's success in advancing our pipeline and maintaining business continuity in a challenging environment. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank the frontline healthcare workers, scientists, and government officials working together to bring the world back to normalcy.  And with that, I'll pass it on to my colleague, Rob, to review the details of our performance and our outlook.\nRob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored and humbled to be named as Merck's next Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to continuing the important work we do to bring our medicines and vaccines to the people who need them. Under my leadership, Merck will remain focused on scientific innovation as the source of sustained long-term value for both patients and shareholders. Ken's unrelenting commitment to excellence and scientific innovation with patients at the center of everything we do permeates the culture of the company and its employees. Under Ken's leadership, Merck has achieved improved growth, clinical success, most notably with KEYTRUDA, and a revitalized pipeline and discovery research capability that will benefit both the company and the patients we serve for many years to come. Ken has put us in a position of financial and operational strength, from which we will be able to pursue our important mission to save and sustain lives through ongoing scientific innovation. The company has benefited from Ken's leadership. I personally and professionally benefited from his mentorship and guidance and want to thank him for that. His shoes won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today. The talent and commitment of Merck's employees worldwide, however, make me extremely confident that we will achieve continued success through this transition and long into the future as we build on Ken's legacy. Now turning to the business. Our resilience in a year that brought us countless challenges amidst the global pandemic is a true testament to the talent, hard work, and dedication of Merck employees worldwide. Our performance in this environment reinforces the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our potential for strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Underlying demand for our key growth pillars allowed our business to deliver 2% growth year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of exchange, while absorbing approximately $2.5 billion of negative pandemic impact to revenues. Were it not for the pandemic impacts, we estimate growth for the year would have been approximately 9% ex exchange. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $400 million due to the pandemic. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter revenues would have grown by approximately 9% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues increased 6%. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 27% to $4 billion and for the year by 30% to $14 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types. We continue to see strong growth outside of lung cancer, including in renal and endometrial carcinomas, and further uptake in our Q6 weekly dosing regimen. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications. Uptake from KEYNOTE-189 in newly imbursed markets for KEYNOTE-407 remain the key growth drivers in the EU. In Japan, price adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and are meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 53% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. Our vaccines portfolio continues to be impacted by below normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales grew year-over-year, mostly reflecting the impact from the $120 million CDC stockpile replenishment in the quarter and the initial $120 million borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had a combined positive impact of $240 million year-over-year. Our hospital performance showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter. BRIDION sales grew 13% year-over-year, driven by continued market share gains, offset in part by lower elective surgery procedures. Our Animal Health business again delivered a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and 6% growth. Companion Animal grew 9%, reflecting demand for companion animal vaccines and parasiticides. Livestock grew 4%, primarily reflecting an extra month of sales from the acquisition of Antelliq, partially offset by distributor purchasing patterns. Turning to the rest of our P&L. My comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73% in the quarter, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs due to a recall of ZERBAXA, pricing pressure and foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew 4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. COVID had a largely neutral impact as operating savings were offset by incremental spend to advance our COVID-19 research programs. Operating expenses in the quarter reflect overall growth in R&D spending, as well as a donation to the Merck Foundation. Other income increased year-over-year driven by income from equity securities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from a year ago due to favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.32 per share, an increase of 17%. Now, before detailing our 2021 outlook, I want to highlight that our press release details reporting changes we will be implementing beginning in the first quarter that are reflected in our guidance ranges. These changes result in a better alignment between our non-GAAP results and the underlying operational performance of our company and improved unpredictable quarter-to-quarter volatility. While these changes will have an impact on our non-GAAP results going forward, there is no impact to cash flow. Turning to 2021 guidance. For Merck, we expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020, and excludes any potential revenue from our COVID therapeutics. This range assumes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-January rates. We assume full year pandemic impacts to be approximately 2% or roughly $1 billion, largely in the first half of the year. Our gross margin will be roughly 77% including a benefit of 1.8 percentage points due to the reporting change. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to mid-single-digits. We expect other expense of $400 million in our other income and expense line, driven largely by net interest expense. Under our prior reporting, we would have guided to an expected $400 million of income, resulting in an $800 million unfavorable swing. This difference is driven by an expected gain on the amount sale of Preventice, mark-to-market gains on our fund holdings, which include our indirect investment in Moderna, and other expected investment gains that will now be excluded from non-GAAP. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. And we anticipate 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% versus 2020 recast EPS. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our EPS growth under the new reporting convention benefits from the removal of the disproportionate mark-to-market equity gains we recorded in 2020. Importantly, however, under either reporting method, we expect strong operating margin leverage of 1 percentage point or more in 2021. The benefit to our 2021 EPS guidance is only $0.08 under new reporting versus previous reporting. We will continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellness visits and delayed procedures as we move into and through 2021. We remain confident in our ability to grow both in the near and long-term, driven by our portfolio of derisked and innovative assets. Now turning to Organon. We are on track to complete the spin-off of Organon, which we expect will take place in the second quarter -- I should say, late in the second quarter. The strategic merits of this transaction are even more clear as we sit here today. In 2020, we brought the products we will spin-off as part of Organon, achieved revenues of $6.5 billion. The high level metrics for Organon that we provided a year ago remain largely unchanged. We expect Organon to achieve 2021 revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Off of this base and as the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity on key brands diminishes, we expect Organon to achieve longer-term revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. As a standalone company post spin, we continue to expect Organon's operating margins to be in the mid-30% range and to increase over time. This compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% within Merck, with the difference reflecting additional costs Organon will incur to operate as an independent company. EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the high 30% range initially and are expected to grow over time. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance due to a lower proportion of capital assets transferred to Organon versus our initial expectations. We expect Organon to have initial debt of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Merck expects to receive a special tax-free dividend of $8.5 billion to $9 billion prior to the spin. We continue to expect Organon to pay a meaningful dividend that will be entirely incremental to that of Merck. For Merck, spin-off of Organon is expected to enable incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including approximately $500 million in 2021, which is included in our guidance. We now expect to deliver operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, an increase of 2 percentage points versus our prior expectation of greater than 40% as a result of the impact of the reporting change. For modeling purposes, please be aware that Merck will continue to incur overhead costs previously allocated to the Organon products, which we estimate to be approximately $400 million on a full year basis. These stranded costs will be reduced over time and are netted into the overall efficiency target. To conclude, the strength and resilience of our business in 2021 -- in 2020 reinforces our confidence as we begin the New Year. Demand for our key growth drivers remains intact, and we are confident that we will deliver strong growth in 2021 and long into the future. We will continue to use our strong financial position to invest meaningfully in our pipeline, capitalizing both internal and external opportunities, and to make the right strategic decisions like the spin-off of Organon to position our company for continued success.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.\nKen Frazier: Thank you, Rob. As I've underscored many times, innovative research is the cornerstone of Merck. This is why we planned carefully for Dr. Roger Perlmutter's retirement and the transition of leadership of the Merck Research Laboratories to Dr. Dean Li, who I'm pleased to welcome to today's call. Dean is a physician scientist who has a keen understanding of Merck's mission, dedication to science and our early and late-stage assets. He has hands-on experience leading key areas of research, including early discovery in translational medicine, while under Roger's leadership at Merck, as well as in his prior role where he exploited new technologies to found company and was a leader in an academic healthcare delivery system. We believe he is uniquely positioned to take on this important role and advance Merck's promising pipeline. I'm confident that under Dean's leadership, Merck's legacy of innovative R&D will continue and we will persist in successfully bringing forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines that make a real difference for patients and shareholders alike. Dean?\nDean Li: Thank you, Ken. I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as Head of Merck Research Laboratories. And so for my remarks today, I will provide an update on our COVID research effort, cover key regulatory milestones, clinical updates and recent business developments, first in our oncology pipeline and then the broader pipeline. Regarding our COVID-19 research programs, Merck has made the decision to discontinue development of its vaccine candidate, V590 and V591. This decision was based on clinical finding from Phase 1 study showing that, while the vaccines were well tolerated, immune responses were inferior to those observed with natural infection and those reported for other authorized COVID vaccines. We are grateful to our collaborators and the volunteers who participated in this trial. Our COVID-19 efforts now shift, advancing our two therapeutic candidates, molnupiravir, often known as MK-4482 and MK-7110. Our orally available antiviral candidate molnupiravir, which we are developing in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, continues to progress in our Phase 2/3 trials studying hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The primary completion date is in May 2021, but it is possible that we may have interim efficacy data in the first quarter which, of course, we would share publicly, if meaningful. Molnupiravir has the potential to play an important role in the current pandemic as well as other emerging novel coronavirus infections. We have been scaling production capacity and expect to have over 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. We recently added the second candidate to address COVID-19 through the acquisition of OncoImmune. This agent, MK-7110 is a recombinant fusion protein administered by IV infusion that targets the novel immune checkpoint. Final results are expected in our -- in the clinical trial in the first quarter. Turning to oncology. In the fourth quarter, KEYTRUDA received an additional new approval in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 at a combined proportion score of 10 or greater. The approval was based on progression-free survival results from KEYNOTE-355, and this marks the 17th tumor type for which KEYTRUDA has been approved. Also in the last quarter, the FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application with Priority Review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. These results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. The FDA target action date is April 13. Working with our partners at Eisai, we are pleased to note positive results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial for KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and these data will be presented at ASCO GU next week. We also announced that KEYNOTE-775 evaluating KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for treatment of second-line endometrial carcinoma was stopped early. The independent data monitoring committee reported that KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima demonstrated a significant improvement across all endpoints versus chemotherapy. The success of KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775 reinforces the opportunity presented by the combination of KEYTRUDA in the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima. We continue to explore this combination in 19 studies spanning multiple tumor types. Now looking ahead, we look forward to meeting with the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee to discuss data from the third interim analysis from KEYNOTE-522, evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as compared with an alternative regimen. The BLA that includes data from this study is currently under FDA review with a PDUFA date next month. Business development remains a priority. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of VelosBio, whose lead candidate, VLS-101, known as MK-2140, is a ROR1 targeted antibody drug conjugate currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study of patients with solid tumor and in Phase 1 for patients with hematologic malignancies. This opportunity, along with the LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugate that we are developing in partnership with Seagen underscores our commitment to investigating tumor-targeted chemotherapy using next-generation antibody drug conjugate. Now as part of our strategy to explore new tumor targeting technology, we recently entered collaborations with A2 Biotherapeutics and Artiva Biotherapeutics aimed at evaluating opportunities for K and NK cell therapy and a third collaboration with Janux Therapeutics on their T-cell engager technology. These collaborations, along with work already underway with Dragonfly Therapeutics to design targeted NK cell engagers, support our commitment to tumor targeting technologies. Now turning to our broader pipeline. We continue to progress our suite of pneumococcal vaccine candidates, V114, V116 and V117. Each one is designed for targeted production against prevalent pneumococcal disease serotypes across different age groups. For V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate was recently granted Priority Review by the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The target action date is July 18. Adults administered V114 produced comparable levels of antibodies for all serotypes in the currently available conjugate vaccines with higher responses observed for serotype 3, one of the most common causes of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults and in children. Robust response to unique disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, were also observed. Now in the U.S., serotypes 22F and 33F have been linked, the 13% of invasive pneumococcal disease seen among adults aged 65 and older; and in Europe, 7% to 12% of adult cases. Our V114 Phase 3 pediatric studies are on track, and we anticipate results from these trials this year.  In addition to V114, we are progressing our adult and pediatric next-gen vaccines, V116 and V117. The infectious disease space islatravir, our novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for HIV continues to progress in both the treatment and in the PrEP setting. In the PrEP setting, we expect to begin recruitment soon for 2 new Phase 3 trials, IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24 in different populations at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection. Now IMPOWER 22 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of islatravir as a once-monthly oral capsule in adult women and adolescent girls. IMPOWER 24 will evaluate the same regimen in men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. Also, in the PrEP setting, positive interim results from the Phase 2 trial evaluating islatravir as a once-monthly oral PrEP regimen were recently presented at HIV Research for Prevention 2021. These interim results show that islatravir achieved the efficacy pharmakinetic threshold at each of the 2 doses study, 60 milligrams and 120 milligrams, and that these doses are well tolerated. These findings offer further evidence for the potential of islatravir to provide a monthly oral PrEP option for people at risk of acquiring HIV. Now in addition, as we announced previously, we are advancing MK-8507, our non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in combination with islatravir into a Phase 2 study as a potential once-weekly oral treatment option. This weekly islatravir MK-8507 combination builds on the once-daily islatravir plus doravirine combination currently in Phase 3, a Phase 3 study, which we expect to start to read out in the second half of 2021. Finally, we received FDA approval for Verquvo following Priority Review. This new option for patients who\u2019ve experienced worsening heart failure built on our commitment to develop therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease. We at Merck Research Laboratories are well positioned to continue to take full advantage of our [considerable] strength in oncology and vaccine while investing in other therapeutic areas, exploring new modalities and complementing and supplementing our internal pipeline with external opportunities. I will now turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. We recognize there could be additional questions today, and we're prepared to extend the call past 9 AM. But in order to get to as many analysts as possible, I ask that you please limit yourselves to one question. Lara, could you start the queue, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] So your first question will come from the line of Mr. Seamus Fernandez.\nSeamus Fernandez : So Rob, congratulations on the CEO appointment. Just wanted to get a sense of your thoughts in terms of Merck moving forward. You've talked about the underappreciation of the upside that you see for the company in 2023 plus relative to consensus expectations, but the obvious question that is going to continue is, how are you thinking about the evolution of the company in sort of 2026 to 2030 as KEYTRUDA basically approaches its patent expiration. What do you think the company really needs to do in that regard? And then just as a follow-up to that, just from a strategic perspective, can you just give us your thoughts around the Animal Health business as part of Merck? Could that be part of a future restructuring?\nRob Davis : Thanks, Seamus, for the question. As we look forward, from a strategic perspective, obviously, there'll be a lot more time as we move into the months and quarters to come to continue to have the dialogue. But I think at the highest level, the important point is that the strategy we've been under, which is focused on scientific innovation as the core of who we are, driven first by really the revitalization of what we're doing in the drug discovery and from a clinical development perspective, which I think you're seeing the fruits of, and obviously, what we're achieving with KEYTRUDA and with what we see as a growing earlier stage pipeline, which we're excited about. So, as we look at 2025 and beyond, and into the 2030 timeframe, it really is to continue to focus first and foremost on investing behind the best science, whether it comes from inside the company or outside the company, execute on the pipeline we have. We have a lot of great -- near-term, late-stage launches coming. We've got islatravir, we've got our V114, the entire pneumococcal franchise that we're building. We have obviously a whole host of opportunities in oncology which I'm sure Dean and others would be happy to comment on. Looking at both what we can do to extend the breadth of KEYTRUDA's reach to the number of patients it serves as well as its efficacy through combinations as well as broadening into other oncology fields and broader mechanisms, which we have. So, that all will be continued to be where we will focus our efforts. As we look at that, we realize, though, we will need to continue to do business development to augment that, and we are committed to that. We've been pretty consistent in talking about the urgency we have around business development. That hasn't changed. That won't change. But what also won't change is we will do it when we see an alignment of strategy and value that is tied with our scientific endeavor and that -- so that is really the way we look. But as we started to highlight even at the JPMorgan Conference, I think people underappreciate what we have as growth opportunities as we start to move into that 2028 and beyond time frame. Clearly, we have a real opportunity to continue to grow between now and then with KEYTRUDA, but I think actually we will have an opportunity to grow beyond them through all of the things I mentioned. So more of the same from that regard.  And then with regard to Animal Health, we continue to see Animal Health as a strategic part of this business. If you look at the growth that business delivers, it's best-in-class within the animal health space. It's accretive to the overall position for Merck and we are investing in it, and I think it is positioned to continue to show very strong growth, both through the existing products it has, but also through a very good portfolio of pipeline products which is leveraging the synergies we have with the MRL function we have on the Human Health side. So, as we sit here looking forward, I continue to see Animal Health as a core part of our strategy. And as we've said, we always are looking at our portfolio, but everything I see tells me that this is something we will maintain and grow because we are the most advantaged owner, in my mind.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Next question please, Lara.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum : A question on islatravir please. Roger was quite determined that cabotegravir was not the right dancing partner for fixed-dose combination in the treatment setting. But aside from the capsid inhibitor, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of other options. With a fresh pair of eyes under Dean's leadership, should we assume that the status quo remains intact or whether another look at cabotegravir as a combination may be interesting? And then secondly, perhaps you could comment on whether, in the PrEP setting, you can bridge -- you can bridge islatravir to explore different delivery formulations, including very long-acting without running separate trials?\nDean Li : Yes. So, thank you for that question. I'll just make some comments that will sort of frame how one might want to think about islatravir. And one way to think about it is, is with the lens that we believe that this can be a foundational medicine, both in PrEP and in treatment. And the favorable attribute to recognize is PK dosing schedule, route of administration, resistant profile, tissue levels, and combinability. And so, the question in relationship to treatment is, I've laid out what we're doing once daily, once weekly, but if this molecule is as foundational as we believe it is, this is something that could combine with many different mechanisms and many different molecules. I can just tell you that integrase inhibitors, which is cabotegravir, that's an important class. It's an important class that's actually very dear to Merck, and so that needs to be looked at carefully. And then lenacapavir, which you allude to, that's a new mechanism, and we believe that islatravir as a foundational medicine should -- we should look at the full array of combinations that can be achieved because we believe it's foundational, and we believe that, that foundation can provide a lot of benefit for many different patients, and we should look at all combinations possible that would allow us to prove that and to show that.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Next question please Lara.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Terence Flynn.\nTerence Flynn: Congrats again, Ken, on a remarkable career and best wishes in the future. And congratulations, Rob, as well on the new role and responsibilities and best of luck. I just -- maybe a 2-part question. Rob, I was just wondering if you can provide your perspective on the share repurchase outlook for 2021. Obviously, you have the $8 billion to $9 billion dividend coming in from Organon. Maybe how aggressive are you going to be on that front? And then just a question for Dean on MK-4482, building on Ken's comment regarding an important contribution from this drug in the COVID paradigm, I was wondering if you guys already have some of that initial Phase 2 data in-house?\nRob Davis : Maybe I'll go first and then turn it over to Dean. Thanks for the question, Terence, and thank you for the congratulatory comments. As you look at share repurchase, as we've been saying, we continue to prioritize business development as where we want to go. Obviously, first and foremost, it's about funding our internal R&D efforts and funding the capacity expansion efforts we have underway from a capital perspective. But really beyond that, as we've talked, we would like to see business development. And so we have been holding back on share repurchase for that purpose. But what we've also been clear to say is that we're not looking to just grow cash to grow cash, and we're not looking to drive up our credit rating. So over time, if we don't find those opportunities to utilize the cash for business development, eventually, we will return it to shareholders. And that's on an ongoing basis. And then you asked explicitly about the $8 billion to $9 billion -- the potential dividend we're getting coming from -- the dividend from the Organon spin. With that similar answer, our goal would, first and foremost, be business development. But we also will look if we don't have those opportunities to return that to shareholders, and we'll be able to make those determinations as we get closer to late second quarter and into the second half of 2021.\nDean Li : Yes. In terms of the 4482 question, it's a Phase 2/3 trial. It has different interim analysis. The critical component of the Phase 2 different interim analysis is to sort of establish dose. And at this point, we have not fully taken a look at all of the data that is available to us in relationship to that Phase 2.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you Terence. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Thanks for the questions and congrats as well to both Ken and Rob. I just had a 2-part question on capital deployment in Biz Dev. It's obviously been a big focus and remains a big focus of the organization. Should we think about any pauses or slowdown in activities, specifically as you think about larger transactions given the leadership transitions that are occurring in the organization? And then on BD, I guess all else equal, would your bias be towards a series of smaller transactions versus a larger one that brings multiple assets. So we think about issues of ease of execution, integration, et cetera. I know you're probably looking at everything, but if you had a choice, which direction would the organization lean?\nDean Li : So let me just start by saying that the purpose behind this CEO transition is not to slow Merck down in any respect. The senior team and Rob have the responsibility and the autonomy going forward to evaluate the situation of the company faces and to make the right decisions to position this company for long-term growth. So I wouldn't read into the transition that there would be any hesitation at all about taking steps that we believe are the right steps for this company's long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob.\nRob Davis : Yes. Appreciate that. And Chris, to your question about our preferred composition of the business development, we continue to prefer to look for smaller opportunities where we can find great science earlier in its life and bring it into Merck Research Labs and then capitalize on that, and we believe bring competitive advantage and differentiation to those assets. So that focal point continues to be where we will look. As we've said many times in the past, it is -- we are agnostic to therapeutic area. We will be driven by science. Science will take us to the areas to look. But likewise, we've been clear to say we're not foreclosed to larger scale deals, always looking at the size, more in terms of its disruption and complexity than in dollar terms. We obviously recognize the need to continue to augment the pipeline, to augment our revenue potential. So we're looking at those as well. But one thing that remains completely consistent as we do not prefer and do not see a transformative deal driven mainly by synergies as a way forward, it will continue to be science led, science-based and driven by where we see an opportunity to bring differential value.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you Chris. Next question please Lara.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen : So Rob, what about your experience and skill set make you the right fit for where Merck is in its journey right now? And then, Dean, when you look into your pipeline currently, is anything there that you think could take the place of KEYTRUDA?\nRob Davis : Yes. Great. Louise, thanks for the question. If you look back at my career and what I've done, I've spent my whole career dedicated to healthcare and to the pharmaceutical industry. And the time I began at Eli Lilly, where I spent nearly 15 years before moving on to Baxter and saw a different view of the business, running the diversified medtech side of that company before coming to Merck. So I have a broad base of experience in the industry and a lens that has really seen it from different views. And I think that is always important to challenge our internal thinking, to make sure we have an external focus and that we are looking externally. But as we look forward, while scientific innovation will continue to be the core of who we are, and I believe, is our best path to succeed in a world where you're going to face increasing margin pressure, we also have to marry with that side-by-side a continuing focus on how do we evolve the business to make it more nimble, to make it simplified and really more focused such that we can drive ever greater efficiency and productivity, not in terms of reducing spend, rather the opposite. We're going to invest in this business to grow, but we have to find a way to make every dollar we invest more productive so that we get a greater than the dollar of output, and that is really where our focus is going to be on how do we leverage new technologies, new capabilities to do that. And then how do we think about broadening our view long-term as you think about not only the drug, but we have to focus increasingly on the outcomes from our medicine, the value we demonstrate and how we ensure affordable access. So those are the cores of what we're looking at. And my experience broadly in the industry and being a part of the leadership team here at Merck has positioned me to, I believe, to do that.\nDean Li : Let me grab the other part of that question. And if you don't mind, I would just sort of make 4 points. The first is immuno-oncology has essentially revolutionized all of cancer biology and medicine. And a quick way to point that out is, if one reads the book Emperor of All Maladies, one looks at it and say, this is outdated because the whole impact of immuno-oncology is not there. And the driver for this revolution has been pembrolizumab. And just so that we're very clear, we continue to want to expand indications by tumor type and by stage of cancer. We want to deepen responses with combinations that span agents with immunomodulatory mechanisms, which the internal pipeline is focused on and agents with direct tumor-killing mechanisms that we have largely done through BD. And we want to extend the value and access of pembrolizumab to patients through route of administration, dosing regimens, combinations, co-formulations and biomarkers. So that's IO, pembro and cancer. So the question that you ask is, do I have anything in my pipeline that has reshaped a whole field right now that I can see? I do not have one in our pipeline. And this is an important point that we should mention. We should remember that we were not in cancer, and IO allowed us the chance to make a huge impact on cancer, transformative cancer -- transformative impact. And one of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger for that matter have always talked about therapeutic agnostic, it is because we do not know that we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. So could that be in my pipeline? Yes. Could it be in the pipeline of others? Yes. But do we have it right now defined, whether it be in neuro, whether it be in cardiovascular, whether it be metabolism? I would say that, in general, the whole field has not seen. The whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to KEYTRUDA or pembro at this point in time throughout the industry.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Louise. Next question please. \nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Risinger : Yes. Thanks very much, and I wanted to add my congratulations to Ken and Rob as well. So my question is, could you discuss the opportunity for weekly combination HIV treatment including your internal assets for a combination regimen and how you are assessing and seeing the opportunity to move that forward versus pursue an external partnership opportunity to bring forward a weekly combination treatment regimen?\nDean Li : Yes. I'll take a first shot at that. This is Dean. Fundamentally, we're doing it step wise, right? We're doing it in PrEP, and we're doing it in treatment. And we're trying to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that this is what we think it is, that this is a really important medicine. And so we're stepwise doing Q day, Q week. But I do agree with you. We have to think about what's really going to be important for patients and their access to the medicine. And so less frequent dosing will be important and that less frequent dosing will be important for both treatment and for PrEP. And both of them are places that Merck needs to explore fully to create that full suite of options as we build the story for islatravir. But Mike, did you want to make some comments?\nMike Nally : Yes. Thank you for the question, Dave. I think a couple of things just to add to what Dean said. I think first and foremost, islatravir is the best partner across a whole range of different mechanisms of action. And we think it will add a lot of value. And we do think the market will ultimately evolve to a longer-acting format. We see up to a majority of the HIV market ultimately being in a long-acting format. And so weekly would be the starting place, and then we look even further out in the treatment space. In the PrEP space, I think what I would add is that we don't need necessarily a partner with islatravir in the PrEP space. And so we think there through both in an oral route of administration and other forms of administration, we can go to long-acting format, potentially even longer than a week initially in the PrEP space. And so that's how we're looking at the market.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink.\nDaina Graybosch: Thank you for the question and congratulations from me all around. I wonder talking about BD in oncology and KEYTRUDA. We've had a couple of negative trial readouts to competitors on TGF-beta and oncolytic virus approaches. I wonder if you could update us on your current perspective on the path forward for some of the early IO assets Merck has acquired in recent years, including Tilos, Viralytics and Immune Design?\nDean Li : Yes. Let me take a stab at that. So I sort of separated how one might think about the IO space and related to pembrolizumab and especially related to solid tumors. And so when you look at our internal pipeline, we speak about having over 25 mechanisms in the clinic. And you're aware of 3 immune modulatory mechanisms are advancing into Phase 3 and they have the opportunity to be co-formulated, TIGIT, LAG-3, our CTLA-4, we also showed ILT4. The other sort of thing that I would also emphasize is that the word is sometimes overused, but it's caught orthogonal. But I simply say that KEYTRUDA, when mixed with tumor-killing mechanisms or standard-of-care mechanism like chemo, surgery and potentially radiation, there seems to be enhancement. And because of that, that creates a possibility for us from a business development standpoint. And that business development you saw with Eisai and AZ, but we are excited with Seagen with the LIV-1 ADC, the Velos with the ROR1 ADC because essentially, there -- we're confident that pembro plus chemo works really well, right? We're first-in-class, best-in-class and transformative-in-class in lung. And so Seagen, Velos, those are ADCs where you're essentially developing a chemotherapy that's a little bit more precise. But our interest is past that. I would call your attention to Peloton, which is essentially targeting an oncogenic nodal pathway, and we would hope that, that not only can we advance that Peloton with a potential 2021 filing, but we're also interested in looking at that HIF-2\u03b1 in relationship to pembrolizumab. But I also want to emphasize that that's focusing on KEYTRUDA as a foundational medicine that can combine with many internal and external assets. I would just end by simply saying, we are in a advantaged situation. And the advantage situation is that if you are developing a drug in cancer and you're a biotech company, you must ask what your molecule will do in relationship to IO. And if you're going to look for a partner, you're going to look for a partner who can give you that quickness, that speed and that rigor to advance that. And so when we say that we have 1,400 trials, including more than 950 combinations and more than 90 registrational trials, I would remind myself that, that most of those combinations are in combinations with other assets from other companies. So it allows us to do BD, not simply by looking at PowerPoint decks, but by actually getting our hands wet with the agents of other companies.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Daina. Next question please, Lara.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat : My congratulations to Rob as well. I wanted to focus on the COVID and MRL. And my question is, is it fair to assume that the first upcoming trial is the hospitalized trial? And the time from symptoms to study enrollment is a little more loose in the hospitalized trial versus non-hospitalized. So should we assume that hospitalized setting is more difficult? And could you also update us on your progress for attempting to characterize in vitro activity against the new variants?\nDean Li : Yes. So let me take both of those questions. The first thing is we're advancing it in both. And we think it's important to do it in both. And so there's no distinction between hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. We think we need to advance it for both because we believe that this will affect the viral application and viral load. In terms of the other question, let me just make sure, the other question was, the variants. We need to do those experiments, but the mechanism by which molnupiravir works would make it very -- we would predict that it would work for all the variants. I would remind everyone that molnupiravir doesn't just work for coronaviruses. It works for many RNA viruses and many respiratory RNA viruses. So the variant difference within a SARS-COV-2 is, there's variation, but that variation is much smaller than the variation that you see with whole different classes of RNA viruses. But to answer your question specifically, we need to test that to prove that, but every expectation is that the variants would be taken care of by molnupiravir based on mechanism of action.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you Umer. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala : And let me add my congratulations to Rob, and thanks to Ken for your many contributions. Ken, I think 2 of your more significant contributions to Merck were guiding it through the Vioxx litigation and buying Schering-Plough. The industry once again finds itself dealing with CV risk of oral arthritis drugs and you don't prefer big deals. On the former, what observations would you make on Vioxx 15 years later, particularly since I believe it's back on the market? And why do you not prefer big deals when it was perhaps your biggest contribution?\nKen Frazier : So thank you for giving me the opportunity for retrospective here. Let me start by saying, I think if there's one lesson that I learned from Vioxx, it is that for a company like Merck, you have to stand strong on your heritage. And people see this as a litigation defense. But I think for every one of us inside the company, it was really about articulating to an audience, particularly in that case, jurors, what this company really stood for. And I thought we won repeatedly because we were able to remind people of the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. I won't go into any more details about the decision to withdraw the drug, but it was also based largely on this company's sense of what was in the best interest for patients based on what we knew at that time. On the issue around Schering-Plough, this company was in a very different situation at that time relative to its pipeline, relative to its growth prospects. And that deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were. We saw that as an opportunity that was appropriate for Merck back in 2009. And the reality of the world is, none of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab. So I would like to take a bow, but that's a classic example of the narrative fallacy when people say, \"Well, look at a great deal you did.\" I think the one thing that we learned from that deal is that when we bought that company, we actually had our eye on Organon and the work that was being done in the basic research labs at Organon. And so we knew that we were buying a company that not only gave us an opportunity for cost synergies, but gave us an opportunity for growth based on the quality of the science. And so at the end of the day, the problem with large transactions, and I think if you look at the history of this industry, is that they are really difficult for our research organizations to respond to and recover from. And so that's the main reason I opposed for those mergers. It's because I think they're highly disruptive. And then at the end of the day, when you get through your cost synergies, you still either have a pipeline or you don't. And what we're focusing on right now is developing that pipeline. So thanks for the question.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Steve. I realize it's 9 o'clock. We're prepared to continue on with some additional questions. So next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Navin Jacob from UBS.\nNavin Jacob : I'll add my congrats to the course as well to both Ken and Rob. Rob, if I may ask about Organon, please. In the past, Merck had suggested that there are some pipeline assets that could furnish the Organon spin-off. Wondering if there's any more color to add as to what those assets may be, just to help us with trying to model out what revenues could look like for the next few years?\nRob Davis : Yes. Thanks for the question, Navin. So as you look at Organon and the assets that will make up that spin, the key growth drivers that sit within that business is, first and foremost, the women's health business, anchored by NEXPLANON, which we continue to believe is going to be a blockbuster drug. It has patent protection for several years. It is growing globally. And as you look at the need for contraception, it continues to fill in a very important niche. So that is a core area of growth. And then obviously, surrounding that is the broader women's health business, including our fertility drugs and other drugs. So that business is the core growth driver. And if you could dissect within Merck and look at that business, excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of some key franchises, that has been growing and will continue to grow. So really, what is accelerating the growth will be further focused on investment in that. And then you layer upon that the biosimilars business, which is really a burgeoning business, very small now, but will grow very fast and will contribute meaningfully to the growth. So between those 2 pieces of Organon, they will comprise, I think as we get out over the next 4 or 5 years, they're going to be 30%, 40-plus percent of the total revenue of the company. Why the business has been declining over the last couple of years is really twofold. One, it is mainly loss of exclusivity. Most recently, we're experiencing the loss of [NuvaRing]. Before that, we had Zetia/Vytorin. So we've been hit by those LOEs. As we look forward, they really don't have those. Those should start to sunset as we get through 2021. So it is really going to allow those businesses, which have been good businesses to start to shine, and then they will accelerate that growth through focus and investment and more of a core formulation strategy and a business development strategy to augment those assets long-term. So I do think they will continue to look at the assets and ask how can they extend them, how can they broaden them, but that's really the focal point. There are no real key R&D programs being transferred over. It's more of how they will focus on those strategies moving forward across those growth businesses with the LOEs out of the base.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Navin. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mr. Gregg Gilbert from Truist.\nGregg Gilbert: Congrats, gentlemen. Maybe 2-parter for the newer guys in the newer roles. Dean, what are some modalities you'd like to enhance or add to MRL? And Rob, I realize this decision has been made on Animal Health, at least for now, your comments are obviously in line with what Ken has been saying for a few years. And I certainly get that Merck is investing in that business and then it's performing well. But how do you bridge the gap between how helpful it is to Merck versus how valuable it would be if it stood alone and traded at 35 times earnings or more? I realize that's one moment in time, but it's not like these peers or just all of a sudden trading at a high multiple and are likely to change? So again, understand why it's helpful to Merck, but how do you bridge the gap to why it's not better served and better valued elsewhere?\nDean Li : I'll take that first question. I'll say 2 or 3 things. The first thing is, modalities are important. They're platform. It's critical that we focus on products. But if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly. In terms of platforms that we are building currently, clearly, we're a company that's really well-known for our chemistry. And over the last few years, we've become increasingly a more biologics company with KEYTRUDA. And so our continued evolution to use that from antibodies to bispecific immune engagers to TriNKETs to protein engineering, those fields are going to be very important. And as we build biologics, it will also help us in relationship to the space between chemistry and biologics, especially with target therapy. So that's a very important play. What I would also say is that I kind of group them in the nucleic acids, whether you talk about mRNA or sRNA or gene delivery systems. Those -- that group, we have to take a look at. But one can't willy nilly decide \"I want this platform because I'm really interested in the platform, that it's neat and cool.\" One has to say, \"What am I going to do with that platform? What is the product? How am I going to drive it from discovery to development to registration?\" So we look at modalities and we look at what is moving throughout the whole landscape, but we don't get enamored specifically on a platform by itself.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Okay. Rob?\nRob Davis : Okay, great. And to the question on Animal Health. So we obviously -- I would start by saying, we look at this objectively. So you should not assume that there is some form of philosophical opposition to thinking about Animal Health differently. It comes from an objective analysis of what we think creates the greatest long-term value for the Merck shareholder. And that's our focus, is long-term value creation. As I look at the Animal Health business and if you really decompose what's happened and why we feel like we're the rightful owner for this asset, you have to start to challenge where is the growth coming from in that business and what would happen outside of Merck. I would start with the fact that we do see meaningful synergies coming from the collaboration with Merck Research Labs. As I mentioned, a big portion of the growth we're going to see in Animal Health long-term is coming from new products. And those new products are, in many instances, coming on the companion animal space through products that they've discovered, working with MRL and looking at the Human Health catalog. And there are also new products coming in vaccines. And obviously, we are the leader in vaccines on the human health side. We're a leader in vaccines on the animal health side. So across the pillars of our excellence, there's a nice alignment from a synergy, and that is driving their growth. It's not by accident that they're one of the fastest-growing businesses in the animal health space. It's because of our ability to focus on innovation and leverage those synergies. And then beyond that, I think you have to look at each company and the facts and take them one at a time. So if just maybe one example, if you look back at when Pfizer spun out Zoetis, Zoetis was a low-margin business that had not been invested in. Pfizer effectively said as much. They made a decision because they weren't focused to spin it out. That allowed that company to bring focus and investment and margin expansion that has allowed that multiple to really take off. We already have, in our own, in Animal Health business, a high-margin business where we're focused and invested. So there's not a big margin lift opportunity and there's not frankly a big growth acceleration opportunity because I believe we fully invest to drive both the margin and the growth today. So I think as you think in that regard, also, you have to look at it. And then you have to ask what is the contribution to Merck? It's accretive to our growth, it's accretive to cash flow, it's an annuity-like business that allows diversification away from the Human Health business, which we know is important. And it's one where, as we look forward, we continue to believe long-term value will be created. So that's just a few of the points that I would make. And I would note, we did where we saw a different set of facts, as we did with the consumer, we will make the right decision. But we continue to believe keeping this business as part of Merck is the best long-term value creator for us and for our shareholders, and that's what drives our thinking.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you Gregg. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ms. Mara Goldstein from Mizuho.\nMara Goldstein : So Rob, I just have a question for you, and that is with the benefit of having occupying the CFO seat, what are you looking for from that position once you have transitioned to your new role as CEO? And if I could also just ask, with the incremental bump in the operating margin guidance post spin out, does that change the upper end of the aspirational dividend payout ratio as well?\nRob Davis : Yes. So on the first question, with regard to the next CFO of the company, what I would expect from that person and what I think is an important role that the CFO can play is to, obviously, first and foremost, you have to be a strong fiduciary for the company. You have to focus and make sure that the controls are in place, the compliance is met and that the company is meeting its reporting responsibility. That's kind of table stakes and expected. What differentiates a CFO, in my perspective, is the ability to partner with the business to find solutions on how to grow strategically. And as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we're going to be investing for growth. But we know that there's going to be pressure. There's -- on margins, the world is transforming around us. We're going to have to find ways to drive productivity to get every dollar we invest more from that dollar. And I think that's an important area where a CFO can help.  The one thing that being CFO allowed me to do, I sat at the crossroads between each of the divisions, and it allowed me to see the whole company and to start to look at Merck as an integrated whole and to start to look to how can we challenge and drive optimization at the scenes that sit between the divisions because, frankly, those are always where, if you will, the corporate tax is paid. And the more you can eliminate those inefficiencies, the more productive and efficient you can go, and I believe that's what a CFO should do. On your question around the margin expansion, it does not change our view of the dividend payout ratio. We're still shooting for that 47% to 50% range. And obviously, we're looking at that both now, but even more importantly as we think post spin. And then we'll continue to reassess that as we go. But right now, that is -- continues to be our long-term goal that we would shoot for.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Mara. Ken, do you have some closing remarks?\nKen Frazier : Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we are executing on our clinical and commercial priorities while making the necessary changes in our business model, and importantly, investing in opportunities for future growth for the short, intermediate and longer term. I'm confident that if we continue to follow this strategy and with new leadership, charged with taking a fresh look at how we operate our business and our strategic opportunity and charge also with taking the right actions for Merck going forward, that the company will be positioned to continue to deliver important value to patients and shareholders in the future. It's been a privilege working in this job for 10 years. I'm pleased to be handing it over to Rob and the senior team at this time. And I want to thank you for joining us and for your continuing interest and support. I hope you have a healthy and Happy New Year.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, all.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. I'm delighted to be here for my first earnings call as Head of Merck Research Laboratories. And so for my remarks today, I will provide an update on our COVID research effort, cover key regulatory milestones, clinical updates and recent business developments, first in our oncology pipeline and then the broader pipeline. Regarding our COVID-19 research programs, Merck has made the decision to discontinue development of its vaccine candidate, V590 and V591. This decision was based on clinical finding from Phase 1 study showing that, while the vaccines were well tolerated, immune responses were inferior to those observed with natural infection and those reported for other authorized COVID vaccines. We are grateful to our collaborators and the volunteers who participated in this trial. Our COVID-19 efforts now shift, advancing our two therapeutic candidates, molnupiravir, often known as MK-4482 and MK-7110. Our orally available antiviral candidate molnupiravir, which we are developing in collaboration with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, continues to progress in our Phase 2/3 trials studying hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. The primary completion date is in May 2021, but it is possible that we may have interim efficacy data in the first quarter which, of course, we would share publicly, if meaningful. Molnupiravir has the potential to play an important role in the current pandemic as well as other emerging novel coronavirus infections. We have been scaling production capacity and expect to have over 10 million courses of therapy available by the end of 2021. We recently added the second candidate to address COVID-19 through the acquisition of OncoImmune. This agent, MK-7110 is a recombinant fusion protein administered by IV infusion that targets the novel immune checkpoint. Final results are expected in our -- in the clinical trial in the first quarter. Turning to oncology. In the fourth quarter, KEYTRUDA received an additional new approval in the U.S. in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 at a combined proportion score of 10 or greater. The approval was based on progression-free survival results from KEYNOTE-355, and this marks the 17th tumor type for which KEYTRUDA has been approved. Also in the last quarter, the FDA accepted a supplemental New Drug Application with Priority Review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. These results demonstrated clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. The FDA target action date is April 13. Working with our partners at Eisai, we are pleased to note positive results from the KEYNOTE-581 trial for KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima versus sunitinib for first-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and these data will be presented at ASCO GU next week. We also announced that KEYNOTE-775 evaluating KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for treatment of second-line endometrial carcinoma was stopped early. The independent data monitoring committee reported that KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima demonstrated a significant improvement across all endpoints versus chemotherapy. The success of KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775 reinforces the opportunity presented by the combination of KEYTRUDA in the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima. We continue to explore this combination in 19 studies spanning multiple tumor types. Now looking ahead, we look forward to meeting with the FDA's Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee to discuss data from the third interim analysis from KEYNOTE-522, evaluating neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with early-stage, triple-negative breast cancer as compared with an alternative regimen. The BLA that includes data from this study is currently under FDA review with a PDUFA date next month. Business development remains a priority. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of VelosBio, whose lead candidate, VLS-101, known as MK-2140, is a ROR1 targeted antibody drug conjugate currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study of patients with solid tumor and in Phase 1 for patients with hematologic malignancies. This opportunity, along with the LIV-1 antibody-drug conjugate that we are developing in partnership with Seagen underscores our commitment to investigating tumor-targeted chemotherapy using next-generation antibody drug conjugate. Now as part of our strategy to explore new tumor targeting technology, we recently entered collaborations with A2 Biotherapeutics and Artiva Biotherapeutics aimed at evaluating opportunities for K and NK cell therapy and a third collaboration with Janux Therapeutics on their T-cell engager technology. These collaborations, along with work already underway with Dragonfly Therapeutics to design targeted NK cell engagers, support our commitment to tumor targeting technologies. Now turning to our broader pipeline. We continue to progress our suite of pneumococcal vaccine candidates, V114, V116 and V117. Each one is designed for targeted production against prevalent pneumococcal disease serotypes across different age groups. For V114, our 15-valent pneumococcal vaccine candidate was recently granted Priority Review by the FDA for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. The target action date is July 18. Adults administered V114 produced comparable levels of antibodies for all serotypes in the currently available conjugate vaccines with higher responses observed for serotype 3, one of the most common causes of invasive pneumococcal diseases in adults and in children. Robust response to unique disease-causing serotypes, 22F and 33F, were also observed. Now in the U.S., serotypes 22F and 33F have been linked, the 13% of invasive pneumococcal disease seen among adults aged 65 and older; and in Europe, 7% to 12% of adult cases. Our V114 Phase 3 pediatric studies are on track, and we anticipate results from these trials this year.  In addition to V114, we are progressing our adult and pediatric next-gen vaccines, V116 and V117. The infectious disease space islatravir, our novel nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for HIV continues to progress in both the treatment and in the PrEP setting. In the PrEP setting, we expect to begin recruitment soon for 2 new Phase 3 trials, IMPOWER 22 and IMPOWER 24 in different populations at high-risk of acquiring HIV infection. Now IMPOWER 22 will evaluate the efficacy and safety of islatravir as a once-monthly oral capsule in adult women and adolescent girls. IMPOWER 24 will evaluate the same regimen in men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men. Also, in the PrEP setting, positive interim results from the Phase 2 trial evaluating islatravir as a once-monthly oral PrEP regimen were recently presented at HIV Research for Prevention 2021. These interim results show that islatravir achieved the efficacy pharmakinetic threshold at each of the 2 doses study, 60 milligrams and 120 milligrams, and that these doses are well tolerated. These findings offer further evidence for the potential of islatravir to provide a monthly oral PrEP option for people at risk of acquiring HIV. Now in addition, as we announced previously, we are advancing MK-8507, our non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, in combination with islatravir into a Phase 2 study as a potential once-weekly oral treatment option. This weekly islatravir MK-8507 combination builds on the once-daily islatravir plus doravirine combination currently in Phase 3, a Phase 3 study, which we expect to start to read out in the second half of 2021. Finally, we received FDA approval for Verquvo following Priority Review. This new option for patients who've experienced worsening heart failure built on our commitment to develop therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease. We at Merck Research Laboratories are well positioned to continue to take full advantage of our [considerable] strength in oncology and vaccine while investing in other therapeutic areas, exploring new modalities and complementing and supplementing our internal pipeline with external opportunities. I will now turn the call back to Peter. Yes. So, thank you for that question. I'll just make some comments that will sort of frame how one might want to think about islatravir. And one way to think about it is, is with the lens that we believe that this can be a foundational medicine, both in PrEP and in treatment. And the favorable attribute to recognize is PK dosing schedule, route of administration, resistant profile, tissue levels, and combinability. And so, the question in relationship to treatment is, I've laid out what we're doing once daily, once weekly, but if this molecule is as foundational as we believe it is, this is something that could combine with many different mechanisms and many different molecules. I can just tell you that integrase inhibitors, which is cabotegravir, that's an important class. It's an important class that's actually very dear to Merck, and so that needs to be looked at carefully. And then lenacapavir, which you allude to, that's a new mechanism, and we believe that islatravir as a foundational medicine should -- we should look at the full array of combinations that can be achieved because we believe it's foundational, and we believe that, that foundation can provide a lot of benefit for many different patients, and we should look at all combinations possible that would allow us to prove that and to show that. Yes. In terms of the 4482 question, it's a Phase 2/3 trial. It has different interim analysis. The critical component of the Phase 2 different interim analysis is to sort of establish dose. And at this point, we have not fully taken a look at all of the data that is available to us in relationship to that Phase 2. So let me just start by saying that the purpose behind this CEO transition is not to slow Merck down in any respect. The senior team and Rob have the responsibility and the autonomy going forward to evaluate the situation of the company faces and to make the right decisions to position this company for long-term growth. So I wouldn't read into the transition that there would be any hesitation at all about taking steps that we believe are the right steps for this company's long-term success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. Let me grab the other part of that question. And if you don't mind, I would just sort of make 4 points. The first is immuno-oncology has essentially revolutionized all of cancer biology and medicine. And a quick way to point that out is, if one reads the book Emperor of All Maladies, one looks at it and say, this is outdated because the whole impact of immuno-oncology is not there. And the driver for this revolution has been pembrolizumab. And just so that we're very clear, we continue to want to expand indications by tumor type and by stage of cancer. We want to deepen responses with combinations that span agents with immunomodulatory mechanisms, which the internal pipeline is focused on and agents with direct tumor-killing mechanisms that we have largely done through BD. And we want to extend the value and access of pembrolizumab to patients through route of administration, dosing regimens, combinations, co-formulations and biomarkers. So that's IO, pembro and cancer. So the question that you ask is, do I have anything in my pipeline that has reshaped a whole field right now that I can see? I do not have one in our pipeline. And this is an important point that we should mention. We should remember that we were not in cancer, and IO allowed us the chance to make a huge impact on cancer, transformative cancer -- transformative impact. And one of the reasons why Rob and Ken and Roger for that matter have always talked about therapeutic agnostic, it is because we do not know that we have the foresight to know where that next revolution and where that next transformation occurs. So could that be in my pipeline? Yes. Could it be in the pipeline of others? Yes. But do we have it right now defined, whether it be in neuro, whether it be in cardiovascular, whether it be metabolism? I would say that, in general, the whole field has not seen. The whole pharmaceutical field has not seen something equivalent to KEYTRUDA or pembro at this point in time throughout the industry. Yes. I'll take a first shot at that. This is Dean. Fundamentally, we're doing it step wise, right? We're doing it in PrEP, and we're doing it in treatment. And we're trying to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that this is what we think it is, that this is a really important medicine. And so we're stepwise doing Q day, Q week. But I do agree with you. We have to think about what's really going to be important for patients and their access to the medicine. And so less frequent dosing will be important and that less frequent dosing will be important for both treatment and for PrEP. And both of them are places that Merck needs to explore fully to create that full suite of options as we build the story for islatravir. But Mike, did you want to make some comments? Yes. Let me take a stab at that. So I sort of separated how one might think about the IO space and related to pembrolizumab and especially related to solid tumors. And so when you look at our internal pipeline, we speak about having over 25 mechanisms in the clinic. And you're aware of 3 immune modulatory mechanisms are advancing into Phase 3 and they have the opportunity to be co-formulated, TIGIT, LAG-3, our CTLA-4, we also showed ILT4. The other sort of thing that I would also emphasize is that the word is sometimes overused, but it's caught orthogonal. But I simply say that KEYTRUDA, when mixed with tumor-killing mechanisms or standard-of-care mechanism like chemo, surgery and potentially radiation, there seems to be enhancement. And because of that, that creates a possibility for us from a business development standpoint. And that business development you saw with Eisai and AZ, but we are excited with Seagen with the LIV-1 ADC, the Velos with the ROR1 ADC because essentially, there -- we're confident that pembro plus chemo works really well, right? We're first-in-class, best-in-class and transformative-in-class in lung. And so Seagen, Velos, those are ADCs where you're essentially developing a chemotherapy that's a little bit more precise. But our interest is past that. I would call your attention to Peloton, which is essentially targeting an oncogenic nodal pathway, and we would hope that, that not only can we advance that Peloton with a potential 2021 filing, but we're also interested in looking at that HIF-2\u03b1 in relationship to pembrolizumab. But I also want to emphasize that that's focusing on KEYTRUDA as a foundational medicine that can combine with many internal and external assets. I would just end by simply saying, we are in a advantaged situation. And the advantage situation is that if you are developing a drug in cancer and you're a biotech company, you must ask what your molecule will do in relationship to IO. And if you're going to look for a partner, you're going to look for a partner who can give you that quickness, that speed and that rigor to advance that. And so when we say that we have 1,400 trials, including more than 950 combinations and more than 90 registrational trials, I would remind myself that, that most of those combinations are in combinations with other assets from other companies. So it allows us to do BD, not simply by looking at PowerPoint decks, but by actually getting our hands wet with the agents of other companies. Yes. So let me take both of those questions. The first thing is we're advancing it in both. And we think it's important to do it in both. And so there's no distinction between hospitalized or non-hospitalized patients. We think we need to advance it for both because we believe that this will affect the viral application and viral load. In terms of the other question, let me just make sure, the other question was, the variants. We need to do those experiments, but the mechanism by which molnupiravir works would make it very -- we would predict that it would work for all the variants. I would remind everyone that molnupiravir doesn't just work for coronaviruses. It works for many RNA viruses and many respiratory RNA viruses. So the variant difference within a SARS-COV-2 is, there's variation, but that variation is much smaller than the variation that you see with whole different classes of RNA viruses. But to answer your question specifically, we need to test that to prove that, but every expectation is that the variants would be taken care of by molnupiravir based on mechanism of action. I'll take that first question. I'll say 2 or 3 things. The first thing is, modalities are important. They're platform. It's critical that we focus on products. But if you don't have the right platforms, it makes it more difficult for you to move quickly. In terms of platforms that we are building currently, clearly, we're a company that's really well-known for our chemistry. And over the last few years, we've become increasingly a more biologics company with KEYTRUDA. And so our continued evolution to use that from antibodies to bispecific immune engagers to TriNKETs to protein engineering, those fields are going to be very important. And as we build biologics, it will also help us in relationship to the space between chemistry and biologics, especially with target therapy. So that's a very important play. What I would also say is that I kind of group them in the nucleic acids, whether you talk about mRNA or sRNA or gene delivery systems. Those -- that group, we have to take a look at. But one can't willy nilly decide \"I want this platform because I'm really interested in the platform, that it's neat and cool.\" One has to say, \"What am I going to do with that platform? What is the product? How am I going to drive it from discovery to development to registration?\" So we look at modalities and we look at what is moving throughout the whole landscape, but we don't get enamored specifically on a platform by itself."

            "name": "Ken Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. Before turning to our financial results and our future perspective, I'd like to make a few comments about this morning's other announcement. It has been a distinct honor and privilege to serve this great company as its CEO over the past decade. I thank all of my Merck colleagues for their extraordinary support throughout this period. We are making this leadership change to cure in the knowledge that Merck has the elements in place for a strong future of scientific innovation and profitable growth. Rob Davis is well prepared and well suited to help Merck capitalize on the many exciting opportunities before it as well as to take on the challenges that lie ahead. He and the Merck senior team will provide outstanding leadership for our company in the coming years. Given Merck's current position of strength, the Merck Board and I believe it is a good time to begin transitioning the company's day-to-day decision-making as well as a strategic direction to Rob, who will assume the title of President in April, at which point our operating divisions, Human Health, Animal Health, Manufacturing and Research, will begin reporting to him. I will retire as CEO at the end of June but remain for some period of time as Executive Chairman to assist Rob, Dean, and the rest of the senior team. I am extremely confident in the capabilities and commitment of Merck's people and Rob's ability to guide the company to an even brighter future. Moving on to our results. Despite challenges from the pandemic, Merck achieved solid growth in revenues and earnings in 2020, made meaningful advancements in our pipeline and added important assets through business development. Despite the particular impact to our portfolio, the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong. And our initial guidance reflects our expectation for a return to strong growth this year, 2021. Looking out to 2024, we continue to believe our revenue potential is underappreciated. Longer term, the work we are doing in advancing our internal pipeline and in adding assets through business development gives us increasing line of sight to significant potential growth drivers later this decade and into the next. I'm amazed by the dedication of our employees who rallied to keep supply uninterrupted, regulatory filings on track, and clinical and commercial execution in line with our goals. And I remain continually inspired by what Merck accomplishes for patients around the world. I'm also encouraged by the progress scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry have achieved in bringing vaccines to market that will help address the pandemic and start to return the world to normalcy. These successes further underscore the societal value of our industry's ongoing investments in science and innovation. Merck remains committed to developing an effective response to COVID-19 also. We have discontinued development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate, but our therapeutic research programs continue to move forward. We believe that our oral antiviral candidate molnupiravir could make an important contribution to treating COVID-19 patients, and we look forward to seeing the results of our pivotal trials. More recently, we acquired OncoImmune and have accelerated the development of MK-7110, a Phase 3 candidate with strong potential in the treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients. I am encouraged by the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad late-stage pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines, including in oncology, HIV, and pneumococcal disease. We remain highly focused on business development to enhance our internal pipeline. We completed 120 transactions in total in 2020, including important acquisitions, such as OncoImmune, VelosBio, and ArQule and collaborations including CGEN and Ridgeback. Our plan to spin-off Organon remains on track for completion late in the second quarter. As independent, more focused company, I'm confident Merck and Organon will have the ability to more effectively pursue their respective market opportunities and business strategies to bring more value to patients and to shareholders. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the leaders of this company and how proud I am of the Merck team's success in advancing our pipeline and maintaining business continuity in a challenging environment. Additionally, I'd like to recognize and thank the frontline healthcare workers, scientists, and government officials working together to bring the world back to normalcy.  And with that, I'll pass it on to my colleague, Rob, to review the details of our performance and our outlook. Thank you, Rob. As I've underscored many times, innovative research is the cornerstone of Merck. This is why we planned carefully for Dr. Roger Perlmutter's retirement and the transition of leadership of the Merck Research Laboratories to Dr. Dean Li, who I'm pleased to welcome to today's call. Dean is a physician scientist who has a keen understanding of Merck's mission, dedication to science and our early and late-stage assets. He has hands-on experience leading key areas of research, including early discovery in translational medicine, while under Roger's leadership at Merck, as well as in his prior role where he exploited new technologies to found company and was a leader in an academic healthcare delivery system. We believe he is uniquely positioned to take on this important role and advance Merck's promising pipeline. I'm confident that under Dean's leadership, Merck's legacy of innovative R&D will continue and we will persist in successfully bringing forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines that make a real difference for patients and shareholders alike. Dean? So thank you for giving me the opportunity for retrospective here. Let me start by saying, I think if there's one lesson that I learned from Vioxx, it is that for a company like Merck, you have to stand strong on your heritage. And people see this as a litigation defense. But I think for every one of us inside the company, it was really about articulating to an audience, particularly in that case, jurors, what this company really stood for. And I thought we won repeatedly because we were able to remind people of the importance of what we do for the world and the integrity by which we do it. I won't go into any more details about the decision to withdraw the drug, but it was also based largely on this company's sense of what was in the best interest for patients based on what we knew at that time. On the issue around Schering-Plough, this company was in a very different situation at that time relative to its pipeline, relative to its growth prospects. And that deal was done at a time where, frankly, we saw an opportunity in the market based on where the valuations of companies were. We saw that as an opportunity that was appropriate for Merck back in 2009. And the reality of the world is, none of us were really smart enough to know that among the assets we were acquiring was pembrolizumab. So I would like to take a bow, but that's a classic example of the narrative fallacy when people say, \"Well, look at a great deal you did.\" I think the one thing that we learned from that deal is that when we bought that company, we actually had our eye on Organon and the work that was being done in the basic research labs at Organon. And so we knew that we were buying a company that not only gave us an opportunity for cost synergies, but gave us an opportunity for growth based on the quality of the science. And so at the end of the day, the problem with large transactions, and I think if you look at the history of this industry, is that they are really difficult for our research organizations to respond to and recover from. And so that's the main reason I opposed for those mergers. It's because I think they're highly disruptive. And then at the end of the day, when you get through your cost synergies, you still either have a pipeline or you don't. And what we're focusing on right now is developing that pipeline. So thanks for the question. Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we are executing on our clinical and commercial priorities while making the necessary changes in our business model, and importantly, investing in opportunities for future growth for the short, intermediate and longer term. I'm confident that if we continue to follow this strategy and with new leadership, charged with taking a fresh look at how we operate our business and our strategic opportunity and charge also with taking the right actions for Merck going forward, that the company will be positioned to continue to deliver important value to patients and shareholders in the future. It's been a privilege working in this job for 10 years. I'm pleased to be handing it over to Rob and the senior team at this time. And I want to thank you for joining us and for your continuing interest and support. I hope you have a healthy and Happy New Year."

            "name": "Mike Nally",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you for the question, Dave. I think a couple of things just to add to what Dean said. I think first and foremost, islatravir is the best partner across a whole range of different mechanisms of action. And we think it will add a lot of value. And we do think the market will ultimately evolve to a longer-acting format. We see up to a majority of the HIV market ultimately being in a long-acting format. And so weekly would be the starting place, and then we look even further out in the treatment space. In the PrEP space, I think what I would add is that we don't need necessarily a partner with islatravir in the PrEP space. And so we think there through both in an oral route of administration and other forms of administration, we can go to long-acting format, potentially even longer than a week initially in the PrEP space. And so that's how we're looking at the market."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm honored and humbled to be named as Merck's next Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to continuing the important work we do to bring our medicines and vaccines to the people who need them. Under my leadership, Merck will remain focused on scientific innovation as the source of sustained long-term value for both patients and shareholders. Ken's unrelenting commitment to excellence and scientific innovation with patients at the center of everything we do permeates the culture of the company and its employees. Under Ken's leadership, Merck has achieved improved growth, clinical success, most notably with KEYTRUDA, and a revitalized pipeline and discovery research capability that will benefit both the company and the patients we serve for many years to come. Ken has put us in a position of financial and operational strength, from which we will be able to pursue our important mission to save and sustain lives through ongoing scientific innovation. The company has benefited from Ken's leadership. I personally and professionally benefited from his mentorship and guidance and want to thank him for that. His shoes won't be easy to fill in so many ways, both within Merck but also including his many principled and valuable contributions to important issues facing society today. The talent and commitment of Merck's employees worldwide, however, make me extremely confident that we will achieve continued success through this transition and long into the future as we build on Ken's legacy. Now turning to the business. Our resilience in a year that brought us countless challenges amidst the global pandemic is a true testament to the talent, hard work, and dedication of Merck employees worldwide. Our performance in this environment reinforces the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our potential for strong growth in 2021 and beyond. Underlying demand for our key growth pillars allowed our business to deliver 2% growth year-over-year or 4% excluding the impact of exchange, while absorbing approximately $2.5 billion of negative pandemic impact to revenues. Were it not for the pandemic impacts, we estimate growth for the year would have been approximately 9% ex exchange. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.5 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year, both nominally and excluding the impact of foreign currency. Fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by approximately $400 million due to the pandemic. Excluding this impact, fourth quarter revenues would have grown by approximately 9% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our Human Health revenues increased 6%. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA sales in the quarter grew 27% to $4 billion and for the year by 30% to $14 billion. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types. We continue to see strong growth outside of lung cancer, including in renal and endometrial carcinomas, and further uptake in our Q6 weekly dosing regimen. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications. Uptake from KEYNOTE-189 in newly imbursed markets for KEYNOTE-407 remain the key growth drivers in the EU. In Japan, price adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and are meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 53% and 26%, respectively, year-over-year. Our vaccines portfolio continues to be impacted by below normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales grew year-over-year, mostly reflecting the impact from the $120 million CDC stockpile replenishment in the quarter and the initial $120 million borrowing in the fourth quarter of 2019, which had a combined positive impact of $240 million year-over-year. Our hospital performance showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter. BRIDION sales grew 13% year-over-year, driven by continued market share gains, offset in part by lower elective surgery procedures. Our Animal Health business again delivered a strong quarter with sales of $1.2 billion and 6% growth. Companion Animal grew 9%, reflecting demand for companion animal vaccines and parasiticides. Livestock grew 4%, primarily reflecting an extra month of sales from the acquisition of Antelliq, partially offset by distributor purchasing patterns. Turning to the rest of our P&L. My comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73% in the quarter, an increase of 0.4 percentage points, driven by favorable product mix and manufacturing variances, partially offset by higher inventory write-offs due to a recall of ZERBAXA, pricing pressure and foreign exchange. Operating expenses grew 4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion. COVID had a largely neutral impact as operating savings were offset by incremental spend to advance our COVID-19 research programs. Operating expenses in the quarter reflect overall growth in R&D spending, as well as a donation to the Merck Foundation. Other income increased year-over-year driven by income from equity securities. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3%, a decrease of 1.6 percentage points from a year ago due to favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.32 per share, an increase of 17%. Now, before detailing our 2021 outlook, I want to highlight that our press release details reporting changes we will be implementing beginning in the first quarter that are reflected in our guidance ranges. These changes result in a better alignment between our non-GAAP results and the underlying operational performance of our company and improved unpredictable quarter-to-quarter volatility. While these changes will have an impact on our non-GAAP results going forward, there is no impact to cash flow. Turning to 2021 guidance. For Merck, we expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, which represents growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020, and excludes any potential revenue from our COVID therapeutics. This range assumes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-January rates. We assume full year pandemic impacts to be approximately 2% or roughly $1 billion, largely in the first half of the year. Our gross margin will be roughly 77% including a benefit of 1.8 percentage points due to the reporting change. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to mid-single-digits. We expect other expense of $400 million in our other income and expense line, driven largely by net interest expense. Under our prior reporting, we would have guided to an expected $400 million of income, resulting in an $800 million unfavorable swing. This difference is driven by an expected gain on the amount sale of Preventice, mark-to-market gains on our fund holdings, which include our indirect investment in Moderna, and other expected investment gains that will now be excluded from non-GAAP. We expect our full year tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. And we anticipate 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, which reflects growth of 12% to 15% versus 2020 recast EPS. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our EPS growth under the new reporting convention benefits from the removal of the disproportionate mark-to-market equity gains we recorded in 2020. Importantly, however, under either reporting method, we expect strong operating margin leverage of 1 percentage point or more in 2021. The benefit to our 2021 EPS guidance is only $0.08 under new reporting versus previous reporting. We will continue to monitor the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellness visits and delayed procedures as we move into and through 2021. We remain confident in our ability to grow both in the near and long-term, driven by our portfolio of derisked and innovative assets. Now turning to Organon. We are on track to complete the spin-off of Organon, which we expect will take place in the second quarter -- I should say, late in the second quarter. The strategic merits of this transaction are even more clear as we sit here today. In 2020, we brought the products we will spin-off as part of Organon, achieved revenues of $6.5 billion. The high level metrics for Organon that we provided a year ago remain largely unchanged. We expect Organon to achieve 2021 revenues of $6 billion to $6.5 billion. Off of this base and as the negative impact of the loss of exclusivity on key brands diminishes, we expect Organon to achieve longer-term revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits. As a standalone company post spin, we continue to expect Organon's operating margins to be in the mid-30% range and to increase over time. This compares to a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 45% within Merck, with the difference reflecting additional costs Organon will incur to operate as an independent company. EBITDA margins are now expected to be in the high 30% range initially and are expected to grow over time. This is a slight decrease from our prior guidance due to a lower proportion of capital assets transferred to Organon versus our initial expectations. We expect Organon to have initial debt of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. Merck expects to receive a special tax-free dividend of $8.5 billion to $9 billion prior to the spin. We continue to expect Organon to pay a meaningful dividend that will be entirely incremental to that of Merck. For Merck, spin-off of Organon is expected to enable incremental operating efficiencies of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including approximately $500 million in 2021, which is included in our guidance. We now expect to deliver operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, an increase of 2 percentage points versus our prior expectation of greater than 40% as a result of the impact of the reporting change. For modeling purposes, please be aware that Merck will continue to incur overhead costs previously allocated to the Organon products, which we estimate to be approximately $400 million on a full year basis. These stranded costs will be reduced over time and are netted into the overall efficiency target. To conclude, the strength and resilience of our business in 2021 -- in 2020 reinforces our confidence as we begin the New Year. Demand for our key growth drivers remains intact, and we are confident that we will deliver strong growth in 2021 and long into the future. We will continue to use our strong financial position to invest meaningfully in our pipeline, capitalizing both internal and external opportunities, and to make the right strategic decisions like the spin-off of Organon to position our company for continued success.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. As we look forward, from a strategic perspective, obviously, there'll be a lot more time as we move into the months and quarters to come to continue to have the dialogue. But I think at the highest level, the important point is that the strategy we've been under, which is focused on scientific innovation as the core of who we are, driven first by really the revitalization of what we're doing in the drug discovery and from a clinical development perspective, which I think you're seeing the fruits of, and obviously, what we're achieving with KEYTRUDA and with what we see as a growing earlier stage pipeline, which we're excited about. So, as we look at 2025 and beyond, and into the 2030 timeframe, it really is to continue to focus first and foremost on investing behind the best science, whether it comes from inside the company or outside the company, execute on the pipeline we have. We have a lot of great -- near-term, late-stage launches coming. We've got islatravir, we've got our V114, the entire pneumococcal franchise that we're building. We have obviously a whole host of opportunities in oncology which I'm sure Dean and others would be happy to comment on. Looking at both what we can do to extend the breadth of KEYTRUDA's reach to the number of patients it serves as well as its efficacy through combinations as well as broadening into other oncology fields and broader mechanisms, which we have. So, that all will be continued to be where we will focus our efforts. As we look at that, we realize, though, we will need to continue to do business development to augment that, and we are committed to that. We've been pretty consistent in talking about the urgency we have around business development. That hasn't changed. That won't change. But what also won't change is we will do it when we see an alignment of strategy and value that is tied with our scientific endeavor and that -- so that is really the way we look. But as we started to highlight even at the JPMorgan Conference, I think people underappreciate what we have as growth opportunities as we start to move into that 2028 and beyond time frame. Clearly, we have a real opportunity to continue to grow between now and then with KEYTRUDA, but I think actually we will have an opportunity to grow beyond them through all of the things I mentioned. So more of the same from that regard.  And then with regard to Animal Health, we continue to see Animal Health as a strategic part of this business. If you look at the growth that business delivers, it's best-in-class within the animal health space. It's accretive to the overall position for Merck and we are investing in it, and I think it is positioned to continue to show very strong growth, both through the existing products it has, but also through a very good portfolio of pipeline products which is leveraging the synergies we have with the MRL function we have on the Human Health side. So, as we sit here looking forward, I continue to see Animal Health as a core part of our strategy. And as we've said, we always are looking at our portfolio, but everything I see tells me that this is something we will maintain and grow because we are the most advantaged owner, in my mind. Maybe I'll go first and then turn it over to Dean. Thanks for the question, Terence, and thank you for the congratulatory comments. As you look at share repurchase, as we've been saying, we continue to prioritize business development as where we want to go. Obviously, first and foremost, it's about funding our internal R&D efforts and funding the capacity expansion efforts we have underway from a capital perspective. But really beyond that, as we've talked, we would like to see business development. And so we have been holding back on share repurchase for that purpose. But what we've also been clear to say is that we're not looking to just grow cash to grow cash, and we're not looking to drive up our credit rating. So over time, if we don't find those opportunities to utilize the cash for business development, eventually, we will return it to shareholders. And that's on an ongoing basis. And then you asked explicitly about the $8 billion to $9 billion -- the potential dividend we're getting coming from -- the dividend from the Organon spin. With that similar answer, our goal would, first and foremost, be business development. But we also will look if we don't have those opportunities to return that to shareholders, and we'll be able to make those determinations as we get closer to late second quarter and into the second half of 2021. Yes. Appreciate that. And Chris, to your question about our preferred composition of the business development, we continue to prefer to look for smaller opportunities where we can find great science earlier in its life and bring it into Merck Research Labs and then capitalize on that, and we believe bring competitive advantage and differentiation to those assets. So that focal point continues to be where we will look. As we've said many times in the past, it is -- we are agnostic to therapeutic area. We will be driven by science. Science will take us to the areas to look. But likewise, we've been clear to say we're not foreclosed to larger scale deals, always looking at the size, more in terms of its disruption and complexity than in dollar terms. We obviously recognize the need to continue to augment the pipeline, to augment our revenue potential. So we're looking at those as well. But one thing that remains completely consistent as we do not prefer and do not see a transformative deal driven mainly by synergies as a way forward, it will continue to be science led, science-based and driven by where we see an opportunity to bring differential value. Yes. Great. Louise, thanks for the question. If you look back at my career and what I've done, I've spent my whole career dedicated to healthcare and to the pharmaceutical industry. And the time I began at Eli Lilly, where I spent nearly 15 years before moving on to Baxter and saw a different view of the business, running the diversified medtech side of that company before coming to Merck. So I have a broad base of experience in the industry and a lens that has really seen it from different views. And I think that is always important to challenge our internal thinking, to make sure we have an external focus and that we are looking externally. But as we look forward, while scientific innovation will continue to be the core of who we are, and I believe, is our best path to succeed in a world where you're going to face increasing margin pressure, we also have to marry with that side-by-side a continuing focus on how do we evolve the business to make it more nimble, to make it simplified and really more focused such that we can drive ever greater efficiency and productivity, not in terms of reducing spend, rather the opposite. We're going to invest in this business to grow, but we have to find a way to make every dollar we invest more productive so that we get a greater than the dollar of output, and that is really where our focus is going to be on how do we leverage new technologies, new capabilities to do that. And then how do we think about broadening our view long-term as you think about not only the drug, but we have to focus increasingly on the outcomes from our medicine, the value we demonstrate and how we ensure affordable access. So those are the cores of what we're looking at. And my experience broadly in the industry and being a part of the leadership team here at Merck has positioned me to, I believe, to do that. Yes. Thanks for the question, Navin. So as you look at Organon and the assets that will make up that spin, the key growth drivers that sit within that business is, first and foremost, the women's health business, anchored by NEXPLANON, which we continue to believe is going to be a blockbuster drug. It has patent protection for several years. It is growing globally. And as you look at the need for contraception, it continues to fill in a very important niche. So that is a core area of growth. And then obviously, surrounding that is the broader women's health business, including our fertility drugs and other drugs. So that business is the core growth driver. And if you could dissect within Merck and look at that business, excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity of some key franchises, that has been growing and will continue to grow. So really, what is accelerating the growth will be further focused on investment in that. And then you layer upon that the biosimilars business, which is really a burgeoning business, very small now, but will grow very fast and will contribute meaningfully to the growth. So between those 2 pieces of Organon, they will comprise, I think as we get out over the next 4 or 5 years, they're going to be 30%, 40-plus percent of the total revenue of the company. Why the business has been declining over the last couple of years is really twofold. One, it is mainly loss of exclusivity. Most recently, we're experiencing the loss of [NuvaRing]. Before that, we had Zetia/Vytorin. So we've been hit by those LOEs. As we look forward, they really don't have those. Those should start to sunset as we get through 2021. So it is really going to allow those businesses, which have been good businesses to start to shine, and then they will accelerate that growth through focus and investment and more of a core formulation strategy and a business development strategy to augment those assets long-term. So I do think they will continue to look at the assets and ask how can they extend them, how can they broaden them, but that's really the focal point. There are no real key R&D programs being transferred over. It's more of how they will focus on those strategies moving forward across those growth businesses with the LOEs out of the base. Okay, great. And to the question on Animal Health. So we obviously -- I would start by saying, we look at this objectively. So you should not assume that there is some form of philosophical opposition to thinking about Animal Health differently. It comes from an objective analysis of what we think creates the greatest long-term value for the Merck shareholder. And that's our focus, is long-term value creation. As I look at the Animal Health business and if you really decompose what's happened and why we feel like we're the rightful owner for this asset, you have to start to challenge where is the growth coming from in that business and what would happen outside of Merck. I would start with the fact that we do see meaningful synergies coming from the collaboration with Merck Research Labs. As I mentioned, a big portion of the growth we're going to see in Animal Health long-term is coming from new products. And those new products are, in many instances, coming on the companion animal space through products that they've discovered, working with MRL and looking at the Human Health catalog. And there are also new products coming in vaccines. And obviously, we are the leader in vaccines on the human health side. We're a leader in vaccines on the animal health side. So across the pillars of our excellence, there's a nice alignment from a synergy, and that is driving their growth. It's not by accident that they're one of the fastest-growing businesses in the animal health space. It's because of our ability to focus on innovation and leverage those synergies. And then beyond that, I think you have to look at each company and the facts and take them one at a time. So if just maybe one example, if you look back at when Pfizer spun out Zoetis, Zoetis was a low-margin business that had not been invested in. Pfizer effectively said as much. They made a decision because they weren't focused to spin it out. That allowed that company to bring focus and investment and margin expansion that has allowed that multiple to really take off. We already have, in our own, in Animal Health business, a high-margin business where we're focused and invested. So there's not a big margin lift opportunity and there's not frankly a big growth acceleration opportunity because I believe we fully invest to drive both the margin and the growth today. So I think as you think in that regard, also, you have to look at it. And then you have to ask what is the contribution to Merck? It's accretive to our growth, it's accretive to cash flow, it's an annuity-like business that allows diversification away from the Human Health business, which we know is important. And it's one where, as we look forward, we continue to believe long-term value will be created. So that's just a few of the points that I would make. And I would note, we did where we saw a different set of facts, as we did with the consumer, we will make the right decision. But we continue to believe keeping this business as part of Merck is the best long-term value creator for us and for our shareholders, and that's what drives our thinking. Yes. So on the first question, with regard to the next CFO of the company, what I would expect from that person and what I think is an important role that the CFO can play is to, obviously, first and foremost, you have to be a strong fiduciary for the company. You have to focus and make sure that the controls are in place, the compliance is met and that the company is meeting its reporting responsibility. That's kind of table stakes and expected. What differentiates a CFO, in my perspective, is the ability to partner with the business to find solutions on how to grow strategically. And as I mentioned in the earlier comments, we're going to be investing for growth. But we know that there's going to be pressure. There's -- on margins, the world is transforming around us. We're going to have to find ways to drive productivity to get every dollar we invest more from that dollar. And I think that's an important area where a CFO can help.  The one thing that being CFO allowed me to do, I sat at the crossroads between each of the divisions, and it allowed me to see the whole company and to start to look at Merck as an integrated whole and to start to look to how can we challenge and drive optimization at the scenes that sit between the divisions because, frankly, those are always where, if you will, the corporate tax is paid. And the more you can eliminate those inefficiencies, the more productive and efficient you can go, and I believe that's what a CFO should do. On your question around the margin expansion, it does not change our view of the dividend payout ratio. We're still shooting for that 47% to 50% range. And obviously, we're looking at that both now, but even more importantly as we think post spin. And then we'll continue to reassess that as we go. But right now, that is -- continues to be our long-term goal that we would shoot for."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Frazier: Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by acknowledging the extraordinary efforts of scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry who are rising to the challenge and working tirelessly to find solutions to help end the pandemic. We remain confident that science will prevail over COVID-19 and Merck is committed to contributing its scientific expertise and resources in support of these worldwide efforts. As we have mentioned in the development of medicines and vaccines to address the pandemic is a testament to the societal value of our industry's continuing investments in science and to the women and men who are working with urgency and dedication to make it happen. Merck has a special responsibility to apply its expertise given its long and productive history in antiviral and vaccine research and we are advancing our vaccine and antiviral programs through focused investment of effort and resources. We have made significant progress over the last few months across our COVID program and our learnings reinforce our confidence that the approaches we've selected are among the most promising. We are moving forward with dispatch and diligence, designing our clinical studies in a manner that is successful will provide physicians and patients confidence that our candidates are safe, effective, simple to administer and distribute, and capable of being used not just in millions, but billions of people. While we understand the importance of moving expeditiously in light of the pandemic, our experience with the natural history of other pandemic and epidemic viral diseases counsels us to seek enduring solutions that can be deployed globally now and for future generations. It is an exciting time at Merck and I am encouraged by our scientists enthusiasm for the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines that we are continuing to invest in. Our deep pipeline and the team of world-class scientists at Merck Research Lab is the result of the stellar leadership and many meaningful contributions made by Dr. Roger Perlmutter who will be stepping down from his current role at the end of this year. I am grateful for the extraordinary contributions Roger has made to science, medicine and the health and wellbeing of people around the world, as well as to all of us here at Merck. Roger leaves behind a strong legacy of historic breakthroughs in immuno-oncology and many other fields of medicine that have transformed clinical practice and improved patient outcomes. Under his leadership the company has received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its [indiscernible] and vaccines globally and he has revitalized the future of R&D at Merck. Dr. Dean Li, currently Senior Vice President of Discovery Sciences and Translational Medicine has been appointed to succeed Roger as Head of Merck Research Laboratories effective January 01. And I look forward to welcoming him to Merck's senior leadership team. I am confident that Dean's knowledge, energy and experience and his purposeful pursuit of new technologies and transformational discovery will help Merck sustain a successful execution of our broad portfolio during this important time, advance our scientific strategy and build on the strong momentum in our pipeline. Now, moving to our third quarter performance, we continued executing on our strategic priorities while once again delivering year-over-year growth in revenue despite some ongoing impacts of the pandemic and very strong EPS growth. Importantly, we exited the quarter with continuing business momentum. We are performing at a high level with production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products and clinical trials moving forward with minimal disruption. The underlying demand for our products remains robust globally as evidenced by the growth we achieved in oncology and animal health. We are also encouraged by the recovery we are seeing in vaccine and those parts of the portfolio most affected by the pandemic's impact on healthcare delivery. We are executing well in the marketplace to drive growth across our existing portfolio and in our lab by advancing our innovative research programs. Meaningful new data that we've recently disclosed in several areas of research including oncology, vaccine, HIV and others increases the confidence we have in our ability to introduce new innovations to the markets and sustain strong long-term growth, and our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities including our ongoing investments in both internal R&D and external business development such as the recent oncology collaborations with Teijin. At the same time we are advancing our plans to spin off Organon, which is on track for completion in the second quarter 2021. We remain confident in our decision to create two more focused companies devoted to their respective strength and portfolios and better positioned to navigate in evolving healthcare landscape and enhance value for patients and shareholders. We continue to hire talented and experienced leaders who will help drive Organon's success as an independent company. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the business and our ability to advance our pipeline despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Additionally, I express my sincere gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers and our employees who worked around the clock to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires all of us at Merck to remain committed to our mission and relentlessly pursue innovative science to help prepare for the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll now pass the call on to Rob to review the details of our performance and our outlook.\nRobert Davis: Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Ken noted, we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business as we once again delivered year-over-year growth despite ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Merck employees across the organization are continuing their important work, addressing the pipeline, and ensuring patients have access to our portfolio, medically important medicines and vaccines, while contributing to industry-wide efforts to develop solutions to the pandemic. In the quarter, we saw a strong recovery in our performance and the underlying demand for products across our key growth pillars turning us up very strong close to the year as reflected in our updated guidance. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, including our capital allocation priorities. We are investing behind our deep pipeline including our COVID candidates and have been active on the business development front. Of note, this quarter we successfully entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Teijin to gain access to two oncology assets that further augment our pipeline. We are committed to investing in our business for the long-term and we will continue to do so in line with our mission of following the science to solve unmet needs of patients around the world. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.6 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year or 2% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our third quarter human health results by approximately $475 million, mostly in our vaccines portfolio. There was minimal impact to animal health. Our revenue growth excluding this estimated impact would have been approximately 5% or 6% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be focused on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health revenues increased 2%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew sales grew 21% year-over-year, reaching $3.7 billion. In the United States grow in KEYTRUDA usage across all key tumor types remained strong and KEYTRUDA continues to be the leader in lung cancer by a widening margin. We are strengthening our leadership in IO, across a broadening array of indications outside of lung cancer, notably in melanoma, bladder and head and neck cancers, with momentum from launches in renal cell and endometrial carcinomas. It is worth noting that indications outside of lung now represent roughly 50% of our sales in the United States and will continue grow over time as we further penetrate these indications and continue to add new indications going forward. Uptake following the launch of our q6 weekly adult dosing regimen helped to offset the impact of reduced new patient starts caused by the pandemic. Outside of the United States, lung cancer indications remain the driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 in the first line setting, where we continue to see strong penetration. In Japan, the combined impact of the two huge seller pricing adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and remain meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 58% and 29% respectively year-over-year. Lynparza's performance in the quarter continues to reflect strong growth and leadership in the PARP class in the U.S. despite increasing competition with incremental contributions from and expanded indication in ovarian cancer and an early launch uptake in prostate cancer. Lenvima maintains market leadership in the first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA in the endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading regimen in the metastatic setting in the United States. Turning to vaccines. As mentioned, while our vaccines portfolio made a strong recovery from the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by continued below normal levels of wellness visits particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales declined 10% year-over-year as growth in ex-U.S. markets was more an offset by pandemic driven impacts in the United States. Volumes in the key back-to-school season were below normal particularly among adolescents. Sales were also impacted by delayed public sector purchases. Ex-U.S., growth was driven by continued strong volume in China and the expansion of general neutral vaccination programs in Europe, partially offset by reduced demand in Hong Kong. PNEUMOVAX delivered 58% growth due to heightened awareness of the importance of protection against pneumococcal disease amidst the pandemic and heading into the flu season partially offsetting the GARDASIL decline. While our vaccines business and in particular GARDASIL is always subject to quarter-over-quarter variability, the longer term trends for underlying demand continue to strengthen. We remain confident in the future growth prospects of GARDASIL due to growing global recognition of its important role in preventing certain cancers, reinforced by recent data published out of Sweden. Our hospital performance also improved from second quarter levels. Most notably, the recovery in elective surgical procedures benefited BRIDION which grew 13% year-over-year. Our ongoing PROVAMES launch also contributed favorably growing 69%. Our human health business has sustained upward achieving sales of $1.2 billion and delivering 12% growth year-over-year. Companion animal grew 18% reflecting underlying demand for the BRAVECTO line of products and strength from our portfolio of companion animal vaccines. Livestock grew 8% reflecting contributions across our ruminants line and poultry products as well as growth from our technology products. We are encouraged by the resilience of our animal health business which has outperformed our expectations in this challenging environment. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin were 74.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 110 basis points due to a combination of pricing pressure, inventory write-offs, collaboration amortization and foreign exchange offset in part by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 6% year-over-year to 4.5 billion. In total, COVID favorably impacted spending by approximately $115 million driven largely by lower promotional selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel, and meeting expenses, partially offset by increased spending to advance our COVID-19 antiviral and vaccines research programs. The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized gains in our security holdings primarily reflecting our direct and indirect investments in Moderna. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.8% and was driven by a lower assumed full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.74 per share, an increase of 18% reflecting strong operational performance that more than overcame COVID headwinds as well as contributions from our other income. Now, turning to the guidance, our updated guidance reflects our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We now expect revenues of $47.6 billion to $48.6 billion, which reflects an increase of $150 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance assumes roughly $2.35 billion of COVID headwind for the year, an increase from our prior assumption of $1.95 billion. We now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 1.5 percentage points using mid October rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 5% growth in revenues for the full year excluding the impact of exchange. Excluding the impact of the pandemic, our guidance range implies year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%, reflecting continued strong underlying demand for our products. Broadly, we're encouraged by the recovery of our business, which has been largely consistent with our original expectations, with GARDASIL being the primary exception. GARDASIL is trending in the right direction, but the phasing of the recovery is slower than we anticipated, largely due to the impact of the pandemic on the back-to-school season, particularly in the United States. We are also seeing some residual negative impacts of the pandemic extend into the fourth quarter, and some parts of the world, primarily in Europe and certain emerging markets. Most importantly, our operational performance remained strong and has enabled us to offset impact from the pandemic. As we end the year and head into 2021, our confidence is further reinforced by the ability of the healthcare systems around the world to adapt and deliver care and by the value of our medically important products delivery to patients. As a result, we continue to believe in our long-term growth prospects, which remain underestimated by the Street. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to decline at a low single digit rate year-over-year, driven by reduced spending due to the pandemic and strong expense management. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 15.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $750 million reflecting higher income from investments in equity securities. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.91 to $6.01, which reflects an increase of $0.25 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2.5 percentage points. Our results continue to benefit from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. That said, our operational strength continues to drive leverage in the P&L through robust revenue growth and expense management, allowing for meaningful investments in our pipeline, while at the same time delivering margin expansion. We continue to make progress on our strategy to evolve our operating model in order to drive efficiency and productivity throughout the organization. This is occurring through process improvements, and the leveraging of new digital capabilities, which have become increasingly important as we find new ways to engage with patients and physicians in this pandemic. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Fully investing in our key growth drivers and pipeline remains our top priority and we are committed to growing the dividend and to driving value enhancing business development that will help position Merck for long-term success. To conclude, the swift recovery we experienced in the third quarter, serves as an indicator of the true value our products provide to patients around the world and our ability to execute. We remain confident in the fundamental strength of our business and the significant runway for growth that our derisked portfolio of assets provides. Further the spinoff of Organon in the second quarter will enable it to realize the growth potential of its portfolio of medically important products and will allow us to focus our attention and investments more fully on our key growth drivers and robust pipeline to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines to patients around the world now and long into the future. Before I close, I'd like to also personally thank Roger for his many contributions to Merck, which will benefit our company and the patients we serve for many years to come. It's been a pleasure working alongside you and learning from you. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger\nRoger Perlmutter: Thank you very much, Rob. During the third quarter, our laboratories made important advances on many fronts, including regulatory approvals, filing of new drug applications, obtaining meaningful new clinical data, advancing new product opportunities into development, and forging new R&D alliances. Our press release tabulates many of these accomplishments, but cannot convey the rapid pace at which these programs are advancing. As an example, during the third quarter the United States Food & Drug Administration approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA in the setting of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, based on our KEYNOTE-204 study that compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to treatment with brentuximab vedotin a standard therapy. But note that approval of this indication was received at just three months after acceptance of the file, a reflection of the high quality of the underlying work by our clinical development and regulatory colleagues. KEYTRUDA is also under review for the first line treatment in combination with chemotherapy of previously untreated locally recurrent in operable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer, with tumors expressing PD-L1, the combined proportion score of 10 or greater, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-355 study for the PDUFA date of November 28. And also for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of triple negative breast cancer, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-522 study with a PDUFA date of March 29, 2021. Results from these studies have been previously presented. In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted positive recommendations for Lymparza as monotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic BRCA mutant, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed following treatment with a modern androgen blocking agent. Lymparza also received a favorable opinion for the first line maintenance treatment in combination with bevacizumab of advanced homologous recombination deficient ovarian cancer based on the results of the TOWER I [ph] Phase 3 study. Meanwhile, in Japan we obtained approval for KEYTRUDA in the second line treatment of PD-L1 positive esophageal cancer, based on data from our KEYNOTE-181 study. We also received approval in Japan for the 400 mg every six weeks regimen for KEYTRUDA across all adult indications, an approach already adopted in Europe and in the United States. I mentioned each of these approvals because they document the continued progress of our broad based registration programs for KEYTRUDA and for our partnership with AstraZeneca on Lymparza which is conducted around the world, despite the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings in early September, we highlighted long-term data demonstrating the durable impact of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of malignant disease. For example, data from our KEYNOTE-024 study in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 50% tumor cells showed that after five years overall survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA treated group as compared with those who received traditional chemotherapy, this despite a high rate of crossover to KEYTRUDA in the chemotherapy arm. Similarly, a combination of chemotherapy plus KEYTRUDA, as compared with chemotherapy alone meaningfully improved overall survival at four years in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and especially in those whose tumors that combined proportion scores for PD-L1 expression of greater than 1, based on our KEYNOTE-048 study. And in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, following surgical resection, the long term data showed a 40% reduction in the risk of distant metastases in the KEYTRUDA treated population, as opposed to those who did not receive adjuvant therapy. Together these data speak to the durable improvement and outcomes, the attempts at the use of KEYTRUDA in otherwise difficult to manage malignancies. At ESMO 2020, we also presented data regarding potential new cancer therapies including vibostolimab, our anti-TIGIT antibody, which we hope may improve treatment responses when combined with KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer patients, whose tumors express low levels of PD-L1, including in patients who have progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Vibostolimab is one of three new agents that we have prioritized for combined therapy with KEYTRUDA, and we will advance this agent to pivotal trials in 2021. We also presented data for MK-4830 an ILT4 antibody that acts to block immune suppression imposed by elements of the tumor microenvironment. MK-4830 showed promising activity in multiple tumor types, including in patients whose tumors had progressed on PD-L1 therapy. Ongoing expansion cohorts will explore the activity of MK-4830 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. More recently at the North American conference on lung cancer, we presented data on the combination of quavonlimab, our novel CTLA-4 directed therapy at a dose of 25 mg every six weeks in combination with KEYTRUDA in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Data obtained after 16.9 months of median follow up showed an overall response rate of 37.5%, and a median overall survival of 18.1 months. Importantly, the median duration of response in the responding population was not reached. The registration enabling study testing quavonlimab co-formulated with KEYTRUDA is planned for 2021. The third quarter gave us the opportunity to advance many other new drug candidates in a variety of other therapeutic areas. For example, we presented additional data on the activity of MK-6482, our HIF-2 alpha inhibitor in the treatment of von Hippel-Lindau disease, documenting shrinkage of tumors with MK-6482 therapy in the kidney, with the overall response rate, including only confirmed responses were 36.1%. For pancreatic lesions in this disease, the confirmed overall response rate was 63.9% and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system the confirmed overall response rate was 30.2%. These are meaningful responses, especially since current therapy for von Hippel-Lindau disease required surgical extravasation [ph] of tumors, often involving dozens of procedures extending over many years. In the infectious disease area, we continue to advance islatravir, our novel non nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for daily administration in combination with PIFELTRO. Phase 2B 96-week data presented at the HIV Glasgow meeting, demonstrated sustained viral suppression in treatment-naive patients which augurs well for the future of this regimen. Phase 3 studies will began in February of this year. We also advanced MK-8507, a new long acting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which we believe will partner well with islatravir in extended dose regimens. Meanwhile we announced positive immunogenicity results for four additional Phase 3 studies of V114, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when dosed in adults. These data helped to complete the entire set of adult registration studies, which will be filed before the end of the year. Finally during the third quarter, we've made substantial progress in our COVID-19 directed programs. Turning first to molnupiravir, formerly known as MK-4482, which is a direct acting orally bioavailable antiviral drug that we're developing in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Phase 1 studies completed during the first quarter provided evidence of the compound as well tolerated as monotherapy in single doses as high as 1.6 grams and in multiple doses of 800 mg twice per day for five days. We believe that the concentration of the active [indiscernible] that were treated should be more than sufficient to terminate virus production. Three relatively small Phase 2 dose escalation studies evaluating the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in COVID-19 patients were initiated by our colleagues at Ridgeback and data from these studies will soon become available. Meanwhile we have initiated two large global Phase 2/3 studies, one in hospitalized patients and the second in outpatients. Together these studies will enroll more than 2700 patients, and will examine clinical outcomes, including both efficacy and safety. Based on its mechanism of action we are hopeful that this new therapy, which is administered orally in capsule form will meaningfully reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Along with this progress in clinical development, we have secured resources to produce millions of doses of molnupiravir before the end of 2020 with an even greater supply becoming available early in 2021. It should be mentioned that in preclinical studies, molnupiravir is active against numerous coronavirus species, including those responsible for SARS and MERS, as well as a wide variety of RNA viruses, including the influenza virus. Hence molnupiravir could prove to be a useful antiviral agent in a variety of settings. Our COVID-19 directed vaccine candidates were also advanced into clinical trials during the third quarter. As Ken mentioned, in developing a vaccine against COVID-19, we have pursued proven platforms, focusing in particular on replicating virus vector that could provide durable protection following a single administration. Our first vaccine candidate developed in partnership with the Institut Pasteur in Paris employs a modified measles virus vaccine that has been engineered to express the major surface protein SARS-CoV-2. During the third quarter this vaccine candidate V591 was advanced into two Phase 1 clinical studies involving nearly 300 healthy volunteers. The V591 Phase 1 studies have enrolled well, such that immunogenicity data should become available before the end of the year. A second vaccine candidate, V590 developed in collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or IAVI makes use of a vesicular stomatitis virus vector, which is the same vector system that we use to develop Ervebo, the first successful vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The Phase 1 program for V590 is proceeding in much the same fashion as that for V591, albeit offset by several weeks. Here again, we are optimistic that the candidate vaccine will elicit durable immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following a single dose, and that it will be safe and well tolerated. For both V590 and V591 we are developing facilities that will enable us to produce many millions of vaccine doses in the near term, and hundreds of millions of doses should those be required in the longer term. Our expectation is that these vaccines will be made available in a format that permits global distribution with appropriate Cold Chain Management, ideally at refrigerated temperatures. Our prior experience in developing vaccines against many other viral diseases gives us some confidence that we will succeed in producing an effective agent for prophylaxis against COVID-19. In this context, I would call your attention to new data from a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine the beginning of October that make use of Swedish demographic and health registries which capture health data on the entire population of Sweden. The study included 1.67 million girls and women, 10 to 30 years of age, evaluated during the period 2006 to 2017. In that group after adjustment for all covariates there was an 88% reduction in the risk of cervical cancer as a result of immunization with GARDASIL before the age of 17. These new data offer hope for the potential eradication of this disease, which, according to the World Health Organization claims the lives of more than 300,000 women each year. The new Swedish study adds further impetus to our efforts to expand production of GARDASIL 9 with the goal of producing enough of this vaccine, about 200 million doses per year to permit girls and boys around the world to be successfully vaccinated. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my colleagues throughout Merck, and especially to those in the Merck Research Laboratories, with whom I have worked on and off since 1996. It has been my privilege to join you in translating breakthrough research into medicines that improve and extend lives. Your success in developing new vaccines like GARDASIL 9, novel antibiotics, new antiviral drugs, new drugs that battle cancer, drugs that improve outcomes in heart failure, and others that offer hope for those suffering from metabolic diseases and chronic debilitating syndromes, your success has not only improved and extended life but has inspired the world. As I plan to assume an advisory role at Merck, I am confident that Dean Li, who will succeed me as President is well prepared to lead MRL to even greater achievements. We have orchestrated an orderly transition in leadership, pledging to ensure in the words of George W. Merck, that human life will earn still greater freedom from suffering and disease. I'll now turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Roger. Laura, if you could assemble the queue for questions, please? And I'd like to ask the analysts today to limit themselves to one question. We're going to try to end right at nine because I know there's other calls that you're looking to get on.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Beginning the Q&A, we have your first question coming from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nSteve Scala: Thank you and it's tough to limit to one question, but I'll comply. Can -- Merck has profoundly transformed under your leadership. In the wake of Dr. Perlmutter\u2019s retirement, I wanted to note that I believe two years ago, can you agree to stay on beyond 2019? May I ask whether or not you will stay on as CEO of Merck, beyond 2021 to see this further transformation that the company is undertaking? Thank you.\nKenneth Frazier: Thank you, Steve. The Board will continue to evaluate the timing of CEO succession right now. There is no specified timeframe for CEO retirement. What I will say is that I am confident that we have internally strong candidates to take this job and I look forward to working with the Board to actively review our leadership and succession planning and to ensure that we have an orderly transfer when the Board deems it appropriate.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Steve. Next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. So I want to say congratulations to you, Roger and thank you for all of your contributions, including transforming cancer treatment for patients worldwide and your contributions will be missed. So my question is, with respect to the Phase 2 oral antiviral data from Ridgeback, could you provide some more color on how you expect that data to be communicated and what you would focus this on? Thank you.\nRoger Perlmutter: Thanks very much, David. Yes, the, the Phase 2 studies carried on in the United States and the UK, are relatively small studies that are focusing on neurological endpoints. That is understanding reductions in viral load and reductions in virus infectivity from patient samples. So these data, I'm hopeful that as the studies complete enrollment and they are dose escalation studies, that these studies will provide data over the next couple of months. And once those data are looked at, and there's enough data that have accrued, then presumably, we would provide a top line statement about those data. But of course, the full scientific results will be published shortly thereafter. We will certainly move expeditiously because, of course, we know the world is very interested in this as we are ourselves.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, David. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. I have a question on KEYTRUDA and adjuvant. Previously, Astra announced a delay in the readout of their adjuvant lung trial because of the ADAURA results that necessitated a design adjustment for EGFR positive patients on Tagrisso. And I'm guessing that's going to impact other companies' adjuvant lung trials as well. Can you comment on the timing of us seeing your first lung adjuvant readout? And more broadly in adjuvant, what's the timing of the next adjuvant readout for you? Thank you.\nRoger Perlmutter: I'm sorry.\nKenneth Frazier: Yes. Go ahead. Roger, please.\nRoger Perlmutter: Yes, so our adjuvant studies in non-small cell lung cancer are proceeding as planned, where we are not at the moment undertaking any reevaluation of those studies. Again, it's difficult to comment on exactly when the studies will read out, because, of course, we're recruiting events. But we are anticipating that the first of an adjuvant lung study will be available sometime later next year and that's our hope, but time will tell.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Tim. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nChris Schott: Great, thanks very much and Roger, best of luck with everything and congrats on all the success over the years. My question was on GARDASIL in the U.S. What do you think it's going to take to normalize results here? I guess my question is, do we need to wait until we get another back-to-school season for this to normalize or do you think that trends can start to get back to normal even in a COVID environment like we're operating today? And I guess when things normalize, should we think about there being some sort of catch up bolus for the patients who missed their vaccination this year or is this going to go back to just kind of a normal cadence of what we've historically seen with that vaccine? Thanks so much.\nKenneth Frazier: Frank?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes. Hi, this is Frank. With regards to GARDASIL in the U.S. I think I'll take the second part of your question first, with regards to the catch up. Our hope is that we will see some catch up over time. In particular, as we put more commercial efforts, making sure that the adolescent cohort in particular are well aware of the importance of getting vaccinated with GARDASIL, so that is our plan. With regards to looking at the timing, I think back-to-school, as you head into '21 will be an important timeframe. Just to give you some additional color of what is happening in the U.S., well visits were down in the adolescent cohort about 30% compared to three-year historical averages. As Rob mentioned, we are seeing a more positive trend, although not what we expected. So we'll have to see here over the next several quarters how things evolve, but we're still very confident in GARDASIL growth in the U.S. as well as globally. To Rogers point, the Sweden data is very important data, which I think reinforces the importance of the chance to prevent cervical cancer for girls and boys around the world. We also saw significant growth continue in China, as well as Germany, and many of our ex-U.S. markets. So I would say, we're going to look over, obviously the next couple of quarters, but our confidence in GARDASIL, both mid and long-term is still very strong and we still feel very strong about the overall demand prospects for the product. Thank you.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Chris. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho Securities. Your line is live. Go ahead, please.\nMara Goldstein: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on the COVID vaccine program, maybe if you could just discuss the clinical program in the context of the pending readouts from other vaccines and contingency plans to make sure that you're able to fully enroll those trials on a timely basis?\nRoger Perlmutter: Right, thanks Mara. The -- of course it's very difficult to speculate on what the results of other studies will be. Like everyone else, we're hopeful that there will be many vaccines that yield positive readouts, in terms of reduction in morbidity and ideally, mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and time will tell. But in reality, we'll be sitting at the end of the year with what we hope will be quite strong single dose of immunogenicity data and we have well designed Phase 2/3 protocols that we can begin at that point. Those are global protocols and my expectation, and unfortunately, given the very large impact of the pandemic, my expectation is that it would not be difficult to enroll those studies in a relatively short period of time, just as has happened for the other studies that have been conducted using, for example, the mRNA vaccines or the and the virus vaccines. So I'm not sure that there's anything there to respond to, except that we're eager to see the data just as everyone else is and we hope very much that there will be efficacy and a good safety profile.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Mara. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Roger, I noticed for the COVID antiviral, there was a dedicated Phase 1, Phase 2 trial, evaluating viral clearance. However, heading into the two Phase 3s we're seeing online, it doesn't look like the viral clearance is the primary endpoint or even a secondary endpoint, at least not on clean trials. And I also noticed you mentioned good safety. So just wanted to understand are you expecting a viral clearance benefit? And how do you see the efficacy look different or similar relative to what we've seen in Remdesivir so far?\nRoger Perlmutter: Right and thanks very much for the question. To be honest, I am expecting to see viral clearance improve and that's based on a whole variety of inputs and the fundamental mechanism of the drug. I do think that in terms of reduction of viral burden, that it is very likely that won't appear they will be superior to Remdesivir based on preclinical studies. Of course, that has to be demonstrated in the clinic, but we will have quite a lot of Phase 2 virologic data based on the [indiscernible] studies which of course were intimately involved with the dose escalation studies. From a certain perspective, ab initio, this is a virally mediated disease. If you get rid of the virus, you should get rid of the disease. The question is, can you get in early enough and is the effect strong enough? The good news is that this is an orally administered drug. It could in principle be given to individuals who either are symptomatic or who have been in contact with virally infected people. But in order to broaden the use, we need to understand both pre-clinically and clinically, that the drug is safe to administer to people who are otherwise healthy and just at risk. So when we speak about safety, that's really what we're concerned about and we're waiting for additional data from more subjects who have been treated with the drug. The drug has been used, it is in a five day regimen and across now several hundred people it seems to be extremely well tolerated. We're not aware of any safety signals at all with the drug right at the moment. So we will just wait and see. I mean, that's the important information that we need to have.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Umer. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist. Your line is now live Go ahead, please.\nGregg Gilbert: Thank you and best of luck to you Roger and Dean for what's next. I have a question on V114 sort of a maybe an R&D and marketing question. Other than the timing advantages you might have versus Pfizer, particularly on the pediatric side, how do you envision having a meaningful share of this market over time if Pfizer successfully develops its 20-Valent product? Investors tend to view this as a winner take all type of market? I think you've made some comments to the contrary, may be you can put some more details on how that could be achieved? Thank you.\nKenneth Frazier: Mike Nally?\nMichael Nally: So thank you for the question. When we look at the market, the first and foremost area that we're looking at, is making sure that we actually confer protection across the 13 shared serotypes of PCV13. And I think what we've been able to demonstrate in the Phase 2 results that you've seen in the pediatric population is that you see a robust immune response across those 13 shared serotypes. And that's after dose three, which I think is also an important factor, because the primary series completion is really an important time point. When you think about what's next, then it's about how do we add to those 13 shared serotypes. And for our program, we've been able to show a robust immune response on 22F and 33F, as well as a really robust response on serotype 3, which is a key contributing factor to residual disease. And so, I think when we look at the real effort on V114, it's always been about making sure that we provide the relevant level of protection in the core serotypes, but then add all the serotypes to it. I think the question on the first year of life will be an important one as well. And we're looking forward to seeing more data from both our program as well as Pfizer's program.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Gregg. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Navin Jacob from UBS. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nNavin Jacob: Hi, thanks for taking the question. My congrats as well to Roger. Roger, wondering if you think it's feasible for a COVID vaccine, specifically yours, but also just generally to achieve sterilizing immunity. Obviously the focus of most of the trials currently is reduction in symptoms, but given the discussion around herd immunity and the importance of herd immunity for opening the economy fully back open, what does that mean if vaccines aren't able to achieve a significant amount of reduction in infection?\nRoger Perlmutter: Right. Okay, thanks for the question. I think first and foremost, of course, what we want out of a vaccine is to prevent clinical disease. I don't think any of us would care that much if people were infected, but didn't develop any disease. If we could guarantee that, that would always be the case, of course, provided that enough people can be can be immunized. I think sterilizing immunity will be difficult. Just in the nature of things, in these respiratory infections, it is difficult to prevent any viral colonization. That will be challenging. But frankly, we are still in the early phases of understanding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent. So we really don't understand a lot about the viral dynamics here. The state of the immune response in the natural infection setting and the durability of that immunity either from natural infection or what we hope we'll see after immunization, there's a lot, yes, that we need to study.  It is clear that at least in rare circumstances, individuals who have been infected and cleared the infection can be re-infected and that should be a cautionary note for all of us. Over time this could evolve in a fashion that re-administration of a vaccine is required in order to prevent recrudescence of disease after exposure to the virus or it may be the case that we're able to control it with a single administration, which is of course what we hope for. I just think we don't have that information right now and we'll learn a great deal over the next few months as additional data become available.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Navin. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Roger, congrats on the retirement. It's been great working with you both at Merck and at your time at Amgen. Question on molnupiravir, just wanted to see if you had any more details from the Phase 1 such as common AEs or SAEs? And given that it's an oral, it does seem ideally suited for newly infected but mild patients. I want to get your perspective on that. Thank you.\nRoger Perlmutter: Right, Geoff? Thanks very much. Yes, molnupiravir from the -- again, small number of subjects who have received the drug in Phase 1 studies and now are in Phase 2 studies it seems to be extremely well tolerated in a five-day course b.i.d. doses that are well above what we believe is required to suppress viral replication or actually result in aero catastrophe and essentially the elimination of the virus. So, all of that looks, looks quite good. As you say, because it's an orally administered drug, in principle, all other things being equal, it could be administered even prophylactically in individuals at high risk. At the moment, we are waiting for additional data because I pointed out that the drug is Ames-positive and bacterial mutagenesis assay, and although the drug did not score in eukaryotic micronucleus assays, and there are other reasons to believe that that won't be a problem. Nevertheless, we're performing a whole variety of studies to explore immunogenicity. Assuming that those studies are negative, then I think we could think much more broadly about prophylactic administration. At the moment, we're thinking mainly about the place where benefit risk is clearly the strongest, and that is in individuals who are infected, particularly symptomatic individuals early in the course of disease, an ideal place for an early administered drug to attenuate the effects of that infection.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Geoff. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nTerence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question and best of luck, Roger. Thank you for everything you've done for the field. You guys are advancing a co-formulation of KEYTRUDA and your CTLA-4 into Phase 3 for lung cancer. Just wondering how broad your co-formulation strategy is and if it's also possible, you could co-formulate KEYTRUDA with your anti-TIGIT. Thanks.\nRoger Perlmutter: Right? Well, the reality is, we've been working on checkpoint inhibitors for a long time now as have many others, and KEYTRUDA in particular, but PD-1 directed therapies more generally have very dramatic effects that are easy to see. We hope to find something that would be even better than KEYTRUDA, but neither we nor anyone else has found such a thing. We are pleased that our agents have activities when administered by themselves, but the activity is modest. It's not KEYTRUDA like activity and where we see the greatest effect is in combination with KEYTRUDA. So it makes sense that these things should be administered with KEYTRUDA. That's the place where you're going to see the biggest benefit and where co-formulation is possible. That's kind of the ideal. That's what we would do because then with a single administration get both drugs, assuming that you don't add a substantial safety burden. So we've conducted our studies and looking at those kinds of questions. Clearly for our CTLA-4 directed therapy, that makes a lot of sense, but it makes a lot of sense for all of the agents that we're looking at and we are looking both at the physical compatibility for co-formulation, and as well, whether that makes sense from a clinical perspective. Where it does, it's kind of the right thing to do for patients.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Right, thank you Terence. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is live. Go ahead, please.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks very much, and Roger, best of luck, and it's been great working with you over the last many years. I wanted to ask a commercial question. We're starting to see a lot of promotional efforts by other pharmaceutical companies to kind of drive a return to growth and a return to physicians' offices, as it relates to primary care visits, and obviously impacting diagnosis of disease. I'm just wondering what Merck is doing on the commercial side, and believes is necessary to really kind of get us back on the right track in 2021? How much of that are you seeing in your business and what are you doing to drive growth in '21?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, hi Seamus, this is Frank. I think that's really important and we're putting a lot of effort. As you can imagine, a lot of those activities right now are still virtually being done, especially in certain markets around the world. But if you look at what we're doing, in particular, in the vaccine area, I think you may be have seen some of our non-branded commercial activities to raise awareness about the importance of HPV vaccination. You can see that we are continuing to put a lot of effort behind KEYTRUDA with healthcare professionals, as well as with our consumer campaigns and activities. And we also are in many markets around the world, continuing to engage in educational programs to make sure that physicians are well aware of a lot of the new data that you've heard Roger speak about here this morning. So we have significant efforts around the world and that's why we're confident in our overall growth profile, as we look towards not only the rest of this year as we head into 2021.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Seamus. And thank you all for limiting yourselves to one question. Great questions. I'd like to turn it over to Ken for closing comments.\nKenneth Frazier: Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we remain extremely confident in our strategy and we're highly motivated by the opportunities before us. We believe our ongoing scientific leadership, promising pipeline, upcoming launches, and track record of solid commercial execution will drive long-term growth. We remain committed to bringing Merck mission alive by sharpening our focus on R&D and being at the forefront of life saving research that will be essential to solving for this pandemic, as well as other healthcare challenges. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy.\nOperator: Thank you so much, presenters, and again, thank you, everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference, you may now disconnect, stay safe and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kenneth Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by acknowledging the extraordinary efforts of scientific experts across the biopharmaceutical industry who are rising to the challenge and working tirelessly to find solutions to help end the pandemic. We remain confident that science will prevail over COVID-19 and Merck is committed to contributing its scientific expertise and resources in support of these worldwide efforts. As we have mentioned in the development of medicines and vaccines to address the pandemic is a testament to the societal value of our industry's continuing investments in science and to the women and men who are working with urgency and dedication to make it happen. Merck has a special responsibility to apply its expertise given its long and productive history in antiviral and vaccine research and we are advancing our vaccine and antiviral programs through focused investment of effort and resources. We have made significant progress over the last few months across our COVID program and our learnings reinforce our confidence that the approaches we've selected are among the most promising. We are moving forward with dispatch and diligence, designing our clinical studies in a manner that is successful will provide physicians and patients confidence that our candidates are safe, effective, simple to administer and distribute, and capable of being used not just in millions, but billions of people. While we understand the importance of moving expeditiously in light of the pandemic, our experience with the natural history of other pandemic and epidemic viral diseases counsels us to seek enduring solutions that can be deployed globally now and for future generations. It is an exciting time at Merck and I am encouraged by our scientists enthusiasm for the innovative research happening in our lab, not just on the COVID front, but across our broad pipeline of promising medicines and vaccines that we are continuing to invest in. Our deep pipeline and the team of world-class scientists at Merck Research Lab is the result of the stellar leadership and many meaningful contributions made by Dr. Roger Perlmutter who will be stepping down from his current role at the end of this year. I am grateful for the extraordinary contributions Roger has made to science, medicine and the health and wellbeing of people around the world, as well as to all of us here at Merck. Roger leaves behind a strong legacy of historic breakthroughs in immuno-oncology and many other fields of medicine that have transformed clinical practice and improved patient outcomes. Under his leadership the company has received more than 100 regulatory approvals for its [indiscernible] and vaccines globally and he has revitalized the future of R&D at Merck. Dr. Dean Li, currently Senior Vice President of Discovery Sciences and Translational Medicine has been appointed to succeed Roger as Head of Merck Research Laboratories effective January 01. And I look forward to welcoming him to Merck's senior leadership team. I am confident that Dean's knowledge, energy and experience and his purposeful pursuit of new technologies and transformational discovery will help Merck sustain a successful execution of our broad portfolio during this important time, advance our scientific strategy and build on the strong momentum in our pipeline. Now, moving to our third quarter performance, we continued executing on our strategic priorities while once again delivering year-over-year growth in revenue despite some ongoing impacts of the pandemic and very strong EPS growth. Importantly, we exited the quarter with continuing business momentum. We are performing at a high level with production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products and clinical trials moving forward with minimal disruption. The underlying demand for our products remains robust globally as evidenced by the growth we achieved in oncology and animal health. We are also encouraged by the recovery we are seeing in vaccine and those parts of the portfolio most affected by the pandemic's impact on healthcare delivery. We are executing well in the marketplace to drive growth across our existing portfolio and in our lab by advancing our innovative research programs. Meaningful new data that we've recently disclosed in several areas of research including oncology, vaccine, HIV and others increases the confidence we have in our ability to introduce new innovations to the markets and sustain strong long-term growth, and our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities including our ongoing investments in both internal R&D and external business development such as the recent oncology collaborations with Teijin. At the same time we are advancing our plans to spin off Organon, which is on track for completion in the second quarter 2021. We remain confident in our decision to create two more focused companies devoted to their respective strength and portfolios and better positioned to navigate in evolving healthcare landscape and enhance value for patients and shareholders. We continue to hire talented and experienced leaders who will help drive Organon's success as an independent company. Let me conclude by expressing my confidence in the business and our ability to advance our pipeline despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. Additionally, I express my sincere gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers and our employees who worked around the clock to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires all of us at Merck to remain committed to our mission and relentlessly pursue innovative science to help prepare for the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll now pass the call on to Rob to review the details of our performance and our outlook. Thank you, Steve. The Board will continue to evaluate the timing of CEO succession right now. There is no specified timeframe for CEO retirement. What I will say is that I am confident that we have internally strong candidates to take this job and I look forward to working with the Board to actively review our leadership and succession planning and to ensure that we have an orderly transfer when the Board deems it appropriate. Yes. Go ahead. Roger, please. Frank? Mike Nally? Thanks, Peter. As you've heard, we remain extremely confident in our strategy and we're highly motivated by the opportunities before us. We believe our ongoing scientific leadership, promising pipeline, upcoming launches, and track record of solid commercial execution will drive long-term growth. We remain committed to bringing Merck mission alive by sharpening our focus on R&D and being at the forefront of life saving research that will be essential to solving for this pandemic, as well as other healthcare challenges. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy."

            "content": "So thank you for the question. When we look at the market, the first and foremost area that we're looking at, is making sure that we actually confer protection across the 13 shared serotypes of PCV13. And I think what we've been able to demonstrate in the Phase 2 results that you've seen in the pediatric population is that you see a robust immune response across those 13 shared serotypes. And that's after dose three, which I think is also an important factor, because the primary series completion is really an important time point. When you think about what's next, then it's about how do we add to those 13 shared serotypes. And for our program, we've been able to show a robust immune response on 22F and 33F, as well as a really robust response on serotype 3, which is a key contributing factor to residual disease. And so, I think when we look at the real effort on V114, it's always been about making sure that we provide the relevant level of protection in the core serotypes, but then add all the serotypes to it. I think the question on the first year of life will be an important one as well. And we're looking forward to seeing more data from both our program as well as Pfizer's program."

            "name": "Roger Perlmutter",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Rob. During the third quarter, our laboratories made important advances on many fronts, including regulatory approvals, filing of new drug applications, obtaining meaningful new clinical data, advancing new product opportunities into development, and forging new R&D alliances. Our press release tabulates many of these accomplishments, but cannot convey the rapid pace at which these programs are advancing. As an example, during the third quarter the United States Food & Drug Administration approved an expanded label for KEYTRUDA in the setting of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, based on our KEYNOTE-204 study that compared KEYTRUDA monotherapy to treatment with brentuximab vedotin a standard therapy. But note that approval of this indication was received at just three months after acceptance of the file, a reflection of the high quality of the underlying work by our clinical development and regulatory colleagues. KEYTRUDA is also under review for the first line treatment in combination with chemotherapy of previously untreated locally recurrent in operable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer, with tumors expressing PD-L1, the combined proportion score of 10 or greater, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-355 study for the PDUFA date of November 28. And also for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of triple negative breast cancer, based on the results of our KEYNOTE-522 study with a PDUFA date of March 29, 2021. Results from these studies have been previously presented. In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted positive recommendations for Lymparza as monotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic BRCA mutant, castration-resistant prostate cancer who have progressed following treatment with a modern androgen blocking agent. Lymparza also received a favorable opinion for the first line maintenance treatment in combination with bevacizumab of advanced homologous recombination deficient ovarian cancer based on the results of the TOWER I [ph] Phase 3 study. Meanwhile, in Japan we obtained approval for KEYTRUDA in the second line treatment of PD-L1 positive esophageal cancer, based on data from our KEYNOTE-181 study. We also received approval in Japan for the 400 mg every six weeks regimen for KEYTRUDA across all adult indications, an approach already adopted in Europe and in the United States. I mentioned each of these approvals because they document the continued progress of our broad based registration programs for KEYTRUDA and for our partnership with AstraZeneca on Lymparza which is conducted around the world, despite the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the European Society for Medical Oncology meetings in early September, we highlighted long-term data demonstrating the durable impact of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of malignant disease. For example, data from our KEYNOTE-024 study in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 on at least 50% tumor cells showed that after five years overall survival nearly doubled in the KEYTRUDA treated group as compared with those who received traditional chemotherapy, this despite a high rate of crossover to KEYTRUDA in the chemotherapy arm. Similarly, a combination of chemotherapy plus KEYTRUDA, as compared with chemotherapy alone meaningfully improved overall survival at four years in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and especially in those whose tumors that combined proportion scores for PD-L1 expression of greater than 1, based on our KEYNOTE-048 study. And in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma, following surgical resection, the long term data showed a 40% reduction in the risk of distant metastases in the KEYTRUDA treated population, as opposed to those who did not receive adjuvant therapy. Together these data speak to the durable improvement and outcomes, the attempts at the use of KEYTRUDA in otherwise difficult to manage malignancies. At ESMO 2020, we also presented data regarding potential new cancer therapies including vibostolimab, our anti-TIGIT antibody, which we hope may improve treatment responses when combined with KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer patients, whose tumors express low levels of PD-L1, including in patients who have progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Vibostolimab is one of three new agents that we have prioritized for combined therapy with KEYTRUDA, and we will advance this agent to pivotal trials in 2021. We also presented data for MK-4830 an ILT4 antibody that acts to block immune suppression imposed by elements of the tumor microenvironment. MK-4830 showed promising activity in multiple tumor types, including in patients whose tumors had progressed on PD-L1 therapy. Ongoing expansion cohorts will explore the activity of MK-4830 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, advanced non-small cell lung cancer, and gastric cancer. More recently at the North American conference on lung cancer, we presented data on the combination of quavonlimab, our novel CTLA-4 directed therapy at a dose of 25 mg every six weeks in combination with KEYTRUDA in the first line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Data obtained after 16.9 months of median follow up showed an overall response rate of 37.5%, and a median overall survival of 18.1 months. Importantly, the median duration of response in the responding population was not reached. The registration enabling study testing quavonlimab co-formulated with KEYTRUDA is planned for 2021. The third quarter gave us the opportunity to advance many other new drug candidates in a variety of other therapeutic areas. For example, we presented additional data on the activity of MK-6482, our HIF-2 alpha inhibitor in the treatment of von Hippel-Lindau disease, documenting shrinkage of tumors with MK-6482 therapy in the kidney, with the overall response rate, including only confirmed responses were 36.1%. For pancreatic lesions in this disease, the confirmed overall response rate was 63.9% and hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system the confirmed overall response rate was 30.2%. These are meaningful responses, especially since current therapy for von Hippel-Lindau disease required surgical extravasation [ph] of tumors, often involving dozens of procedures extending over many years. In the infectious disease area, we continue to advance islatravir, our novel non nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor for daily administration in combination with PIFELTRO. Phase 2B 96-week data presented at the HIV Glasgow meeting, demonstrated sustained viral suppression in treatment-naive patients which augurs well for the future of this regimen. Phase 3 studies will began in February of this year. We also advanced MK-8507, a new long acting non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, which we believe will partner well with islatravir in extended dose regimens. Meanwhile we announced positive immunogenicity results for four additional Phase 3 studies of V114, 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when dosed in adults. These data helped to complete the entire set of adult registration studies, which will be filed before the end of the year. Finally during the third quarter, we've made substantial progress in our COVID-19 directed programs. Turning first to molnupiravir, formerly known as MK-4482, which is a direct acting orally bioavailable antiviral drug that we're developing in partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Phase 1 studies completed during the first quarter provided evidence of the compound as well tolerated as monotherapy in single doses as high as 1.6 grams and in multiple doses of 800 mg twice per day for five days. We believe that the concentration of the active [indiscernible] that were treated should be more than sufficient to terminate virus production. Three relatively small Phase 2 dose escalation studies evaluating the antiviral effect of molnupiravir in COVID-19 patients were initiated by our colleagues at Ridgeback and data from these studies will soon become available. Meanwhile we have initiated two large global Phase 2/3 studies, one in hospitalized patients and the second in outpatients. Together these studies will enroll more than 2700 patients, and will examine clinical outcomes, including both efficacy and safety. Based on its mechanism of action we are hopeful that this new therapy, which is administered orally in capsule form will meaningfully reduce morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Along with this progress in clinical development, we have secured resources to produce millions of doses of molnupiravir before the end of 2020 with an even greater supply becoming available early in 2021. It should be mentioned that in preclinical studies, molnupiravir is active against numerous coronavirus species, including those responsible for SARS and MERS, as well as a wide variety of RNA viruses, including the influenza virus. Hence molnupiravir could prove to be a useful antiviral agent in a variety of settings. Our COVID-19 directed vaccine candidates were also advanced into clinical trials during the third quarter. As Ken mentioned, in developing a vaccine against COVID-19, we have pursued proven platforms, focusing in particular on replicating virus vector that could provide durable protection following a single administration. Our first vaccine candidate developed in partnership with the Institut Pasteur in Paris employs a modified measles virus vaccine that has been engineered to express the major surface protein SARS-CoV-2. During the third quarter this vaccine candidate V591 was advanced into two Phase 1 clinical studies involving nearly 300 healthy volunteers. The V591 Phase 1 studies have enrolled well, such that immunogenicity data should become available before the end of the year. A second vaccine candidate, V590 developed in collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or IAVI makes use of a vesicular stomatitis virus vector, which is the same vector system that we use to develop Ervebo, the first successful vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease. The Phase 1 program for V590 is proceeding in much the same fashion as that for V591, albeit offset by several weeks. Here again, we are optimistic that the candidate vaccine will elicit durable immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following a single dose, and that it will be safe and well tolerated. For both V590 and V591 we are developing facilities that will enable us to produce many millions of vaccine doses in the near term, and hundreds of millions of doses should those be required in the longer term. Our expectation is that these vaccines will be made available in a format that permits global distribution with appropriate Cold Chain Management, ideally at refrigerated temperatures. Our prior experience in developing vaccines against many other viral diseases gives us some confidence that we will succeed in producing an effective agent for prophylaxis against COVID-19. In this context, I would call your attention to new data from a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine the beginning of October that make use of Swedish demographic and health registries which capture health data on the entire population of Sweden. The study included 1.67 million girls and women, 10 to 30 years of age, evaluated during the period 2006 to 2017. In that group after adjustment for all covariates there was an 88% reduction in the risk of cervical cancer as a result of immunization with GARDASIL before the age of 17. These new data offer hope for the potential eradication of this disease, which, according to the World Health Organization claims the lives of more than 300,000 women each year. The new Swedish study adds further impetus to our efforts to expand production of GARDASIL 9 with the goal of producing enough of this vaccine, about 200 million doses per year to permit girls and boys around the world to be successfully vaccinated. Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to my colleagues throughout Merck, and especially to those in the Merck Research Laboratories, with whom I have worked on and off since 1996. It has been my privilege to join you in translating breakthrough research into medicines that improve and extend lives. Your success in developing new vaccines like GARDASIL 9, novel antibiotics, new antiviral drugs, new drugs that battle cancer, drugs that improve outcomes in heart failure, and others that offer hope for those suffering from metabolic diseases and chronic debilitating syndromes, your success has not only improved and extended life but has inspired the world. As I plan to assume an advisory role at Merck, I am confident that Dean Li, who will succeed me as President is well prepared to lead MRL to even greater achievements. We have orchestrated an orderly transition in leadership, pledging to ensure in the words of George W. Merck, that human life will earn still greater freedom from suffering and disease. I'll now turn the call over to Peter. Thanks very much, David. Yes, the, the Phase 2 studies carried on in the United States and the UK, are relatively small studies that are focusing on neurological endpoints. That is understanding reductions in viral load and reductions in virus infectivity from patient samples. So these data, I'm hopeful that as the studies complete enrollment and they are dose escalation studies, that these studies will provide data over the next couple of months. And once those data are looked at, and there's enough data that have accrued, then presumably, we would provide a top line statement about those data. But of course, the full scientific results will be published shortly thereafter. We will certainly move expeditiously because, of course, we know the world is very interested in this as we are ourselves. I'm sorry. Yes, so our adjuvant studies in non-small cell lung cancer are proceeding as planned, where we are not at the moment undertaking any reevaluation of those studies. Again, it's difficult to comment on exactly when the studies will read out, because, of course, we're recruiting events. But we are anticipating that the first of an adjuvant lung study will be available sometime later next year and that's our hope, but time will tell. Right, thanks Mara. The -- of course it's very difficult to speculate on what the results of other studies will be. Like everyone else, we're hopeful that there will be many vaccines that yield positive readouts, in terms of reduction in morbidity and ideally, mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and time will tell. But in reality, we'll be sitting at the end of the year with what we hope will be quite strong single dose of immunogenicity data and we have well designed Phase 2/3 protocols that we can begin at that point. Those are global protocols and my expectation, and unfortunately, given the very large impact of the pandemic, my expectation is that it would not be difficult to enroll those studies in a relatively short period of time, just as has happened for the other studies that have been conducted using, for example, the mRNA vaccines or the and the virus vaccines. So I'm not sure that there's anything there to respond to, except that we're eager to see the data just as everyone else is and we hope very much that there will be efficacy and a good safety profile. Right and thanks very much for the question. To be honest, I am expecting to see viral clearance improve and that's based on a whole variety of inputs and the fundamental mechanism of the drug. I do think that in terms of reduction of viral burden, that it is very likely that won't appear they will be superior to Remdesivir based on preclinical studies. Of course, that has to be demonstrated in the clinic, but we will have quite a lot of Phase 2 virologic data based on the [indiscernible] studies which of course were intimately involved with the dose escalation studies. From a certain perspective, ab initio, this is a virally mediated disease. If you get rid of the virus, you should get rid of the disease. The question is, can you get in early enough and is the effect strong enough? The good news is that this is an orally administered drug. It could in principle be given to individuals who either are symptomatic or who have been in contact with virally infected people. But in order to broaden the use, we need to understand both pre-clinically and clinically, that the drug is safe to administer to people who are otherwise healthy and just at risk. So when we speak about safety, that's really what we're concerned about and we're waiting for additional data from more subjects who have been treated with the drug. The drug has been used, it is in a five day regimen and across now several hundred people it seems to be extremely well tolerated. We're not aware of any safety signals at all with the drug right at the moment. So we will just wait and see. I mean, that's the important information that we need to have. Right. Okay, thanks for the question. I think first and foremost, of course, what we want out of a vaccine is to prevent clinical disease. I don't think any of us would care that much if people were infected, but didn't develop any disease. If we could guarantee that, that would always be the case, of course, provided that enough people can be can be immunized. I think sterilizing immunity will be difficult. Just in the nature of things, in these respiratory infections, it is difficult to prevent any viral colonization. That will be challenging. But frankly, we are still in the early phases of understanding COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 the causative agent. So we really don't understand a lot about the viral dynamics here. The state of the immune response in the natural infection setting and the durability of that immunity either from natural infection or what we hope we'll see after immunization, there's a lot, yes, that we need to study.  It is clear that at least in rare circumstances, individuals who have been infected and cleared the infection can be re-infected and that should be a cautionary note for all of us. Over time this could evolve in a fashion that re-administration of a vaccine is required in order to prevent recrudescence of disease after exposure to the virus or it may be the case that we're able to control it with a single administration, which is of course what we hope for. I just think we don't have that information right now and we'll learn a great deal over the next few months as additional data become available. Right, Geoff? Thanks very much. Yes, molnupiravir from the -- again, small number of subjects who have received the drug in Phase 1 studies and now are in Phase 2 studies it seems to be extremely well tolerated in a five-day course b.i.d. doses that are well above what we believe is required to suppress viral replication or actually result in aero catastrophe and essentially the elimination of the virus. So, all of that looks, looks quite good. As you say, because it's an orally administered drug, in principle, all other things being equal, it could be administered even prophylactically in individuals at high risk. At the moment, we are waiting for additional data because I pointed out that the drug is Ames-positive and bacterial mutagenesis assay, and although the drug did not score in eukaryotic micronucleus assays, and there are other reasons to believe that that won't be a problem. Nevertheless, we're performing a whole variety of studies to explore immunogenicity. Assuming that those studies are negative, then I think we could think much more broadly about prophylactic administration. At the moment, we're thinking mainly about the place where benefit risk is clearly the strongest, and that is in individuals who are infected, particularly symptomatic individuals early in the course of disease, an ideal place for an early administered drug to attenuate the effects of that infection. Right? Well, the reality is, we've been working on checkpoint inhibitors for a long time now as have many others, and KEYTRUDA in particular, but PD-1 directed therapies more generally have very dramatic effects that are easy to see. We hope to find something that would be even better than KEYTRUDA, but neither we nor anyone else has found such a thing. We are pleased that our agents have activities when administered by themselves, but the activity is modest. It's not KEYTRUDA like activity and where we see the greatest effect is in combination with KEYTRUDA. So it makes sense that these things should be administered with KEYTRUDA. That's the place where you're going to see the biggest benefit and where co-formulation is possible. That's kind of the ideal. That's what we would do because then with a single administration get both drugs, assuming that you don't add a substantial safety burden. So we've conducted our studies and looking at those kinds of questions. Clearly for our CTLA-4 directed therapy, that makes a lot of sense, but it makes a lot of sense for all of the agents that we're looking at and we are looking both at the physical compatibility for co-formulation, and as well, whether that makes sense from a clinical perspective. Where it does, it's kind of the right thing to do for patients."

            "name": "Robert Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. As Ken noted, we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business as we once again delivered year-over-year growth despite ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Merck employees across the organization are continuing their important work, addressing the pipeline, and ensuring patients have access to our portfolio, medically important medicines and vaccines, while contributing to industry-wide efforts to develop solutions to the pandemic. In the quarter, we saw a strong recovery in our performance and the underlying demand for products across our key growth pillars turning us up very strong close to the year as reflected in our updated guidance. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy, including our capital allocation priorities. We are investing behind our deep pipeline including our COVID candidates and have been active on the business development front. Of note, this quarter we successfully entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Teijin to gain access to two oncology assets that further augment our pipeline. We are committed to investing in our business for the long-term and we will continue to do so in line with our mission of following the science to solve unmet needs of patients around the world. Now, turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.6 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year or 2% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our third quarter human health results by approximately $475 million, mostly in our vaccines portfolio. There was minimal impact to animal health. Our revenue growth excluding this estimated impact would have been approximately 5% or 6% ex exchange. The remainder of my comments will be focused on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health revenues increased 2%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew sales grew 21% year-over-year, reaching $3.7 billion. In the United States grow in KEYTRUDA usage across all key tumor types remained strong and KEYTRUDA continues to be the leader in lung cancer by a widening margin. We are strengthening our leadership in IO, across a broadening array of indications outside of lung cancer, notably in melanoma, bladder and head and neck cancers, with momentum from launches in renal cell and endometrial carcinomas. It is worth noting that indications outside of lung now represent roughly 50% of our sales in the United States and will continue grow over time as we further penetrate these indications and continue to add new indications going forward. Uptake following the launch of our q6 weekly adult dosing regimen helped to offset the impact of reduced new patient starts caused by the pandemic. Outside of the United States, lung cancer indications remain the driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 in the first line setting, where we continue to see strong penetration. In Japan, the combined impact of the two huge seller pricing adjustments in the first half of the year more than offset underlying volume growth. Lynparza and Lenvima continue to demonstrate strong growth and remain meaningful contributors to our broader oncology portfolio, growing 58% and 29% respectively year-over-year. Lynparza's performance in the quarter continues to reflect strong growth and leadership in the PARP class in the U.S. despite increasing competition with incremental contributions from and expanded indication in ovarian cancer and an early launch uptake in prostate cancer. Lenvima maintains market leadership in the first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA in the endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading regimen in the metastatic setting in the United States. Turning to vaccines. As mentioned, while our vaccines portfolio made a strong recovery from the second quarter, year-over-year comparisons were negatively impacted by continued below normal levels of wellness visits particularly in the United States. GARDASIL sales declined 10% year-over-year as growth in ex-U.S. markets was more an offset by pandemic driven impacts in the United States. Volumes in the key back-to-school season were below normal particularly among adolescents. Sales were also impacted by delayed public sector purchases. Ex-U.S., growth was driven by continued strong volume in China and the expansion of general neutral vaccination programs in Europe, partially offset by reduced demand in Hong Kong. PNEUMOVAX delivered 58% growth due to heightened awareness of the importance of protection against pneumococcal disease amidst the pandemic and heading into the flu season partially offsetting the GARDASIL decline. While our vaccines business and in particular GARDASIL is always subject to quarter-over-quarter variability, the longer term trends for underlying demand continue to strengthen. We remain confident in the future growth prospects of GARDASIL due to growing global recognition of its important role in preventing certain cancers, reinforced by recent data published out of Sweden. Our hospital performance also improved from second quarter levels. Most notably, the recovery in elective surgical procedures benefited BRIDION which grew 13% year-over-year. Our ongoing PROVAMES launch also contributed favorably growing 69%. Our human health business has sustained upward achieving sales of $1.2 billion and delivering 12% growth year-over-year. Companion animal grew 18% reflecting underlying demand for the BRAVECTO line of products and strength from our portfolio of companion animal vaccines. Livestock grew 8% reflecting contributions across our ruminants line and poultry products as well as growth from our technology products. We are encouraged by the resilience of our animal health business which has outperformed our expectations in this challenging environment. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin were 74.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 110 basis points due to a combination of pricing pressure, inventory write-offs, collaboration amortization and foreign exchange offset in part by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 6% year-over-year to 4.5 billion. In total, COVID favorably impacted spending by approximately $115 million driven largely by lower promotional selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel, and meeting expenses, partially offset by increased spending to advance our COVID-19 antiviral and vaccines research programs. The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized gains in our security holdings primarily reflecting our direct and indirect investments in Moderna. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.8% and was driven by a lower assumed full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taken together, we earned $1.74 per share, an increase of 18% reflecting strong operational performance that more than overcame COVID headwinds as well as contributions from our other income. Now, turning to the guidance, our updated guidance reflects our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We now expect revenues of $47.6 billion to $48.6 billion, which reflects an increase of $150 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance assumes roughly $2.35 billion of COVID headwind for the year, an increase from our prior assumption of $1.95 billion. We now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 1.5 percentage points using mid October rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 5% growth in revenues for the full year excluding the impact of exchange. Excluding the impact of the pandemic, our guidance range implies year-over-year growth of 8% to 10%, reflecting continued strong underlying demand for our products. Broadly, we're encouraged by the recovery of our business, which has been largely consistent with our original expectations, with GARDASIL being the primary exception. GARDASIL is trending in the right direction, but the phasing of the recovery is slower than we anticipated, largely due to the impact of the pandemic on the back-to-school season, particularly in the United States. We are also seeing some residual negative impacts of the pandemic extend into the fourth quarter, and some parts of the world, primarily in Europe and certain emerging markets. Most importantly, our operational performance remained strong and has enabled us to offset impact from the pandemic. As we end the year and head into 2021, our confidence is further reinforced by the ability of the healthcare systems around the world to adapt and deliver care and by the value of our medically important products delivery to patients. As a result, we continue to believe in our long-term growth prospects, which remain underestimated by the Street. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to decline at a low single digit rate year-over-year, driven by reduced spending due to the pandemic and strong expense management. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 15.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $750 million reflecting higher income from investments in equity securities. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.91 to $6.01, which reflects an increase of $0.25 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly 2.5 percentage points. Our results continue to benefit from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. That said, our operational strength continues to drive leverage in the P&L through robust revenue growth and expense management, allowing for meaningful investments in our pipeline, while at the same time delivering margin expansion. We continue to make progress on our strategy to evolve our operating model in order to drive efficiency and productivity throughout the organization. This is occurring through process improvements, and the leveraging of new digital capabilities, which have become increasingly important as we find new ways to engage with patients and physicians in this pandemic. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Fully investing in our key growth drivers and pipeline remains our top priority and we are committed to growing the dividend and to driving value enhancing business development that will help position Merck for long-term success. To conclude, the swift recovery we experienced in the third quarter, serves as an indicator of the true value our products provide to patients around the world and our ability to execute. We remain confident in the fundamental strength of our business and the significant runway for growth that our derisked portfolio of assets provides. Further the spinoff of Organon in the second quarter will enable it to realize the growth potential of its portfolio of medically important products and will allow us to focus our attention and investments more fully on our key growth drivers and robust pipeline to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines to patients around the world now and long into the future. Before I close, I'd like to also personally thank Roger for his many contributions to Merck, which will benefit our company and the patients we serve for many years to come. It's been a pleasure working alongside you and learning from you. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger"

            "content": "Yes. Hi, this is Frank. With regards to GARDASIL in the U.S. I think I'll take the second part of your question first, with regards to the catch up. Our hope is that we will see some catch up over time. In particular, as we put more commercial efforts, making sure that the adolescent cohort in particular are well aware of the importance of getting vaccinated with GARDASIL, so that is our plan. With regards to looking at the timing, I think back-to-school, as you head into '21 will be an important timeframe. Just to give you some additional color of what is happening in the U.S., well visits were down in the adolescent cohort about 30% compared to three-year historical averages. As Rob mentioned, we are seeing a more positive trend, although not what we expected. So we'll have to see here over the next several quarters how things evolve, but we're still very confident in GARDASIL growth in the U.S. as well as globally. To Rogers point, the Sweden data is very important data, which I think reinforces the importance of the chance to prevent cervical cancer for girls and boys around the world. We also saw significant growth continue in China, as well as Germany, and many of our ex-U.S. markets. So I would say, we're going to look over, obviously the next couple of quarters, but our confidence in GARDASIL, both mid and long-term is still very strong and we still feel very strong about the overall demand prospects for the product. Thank you. Yes, hi Seamus, this is Frank. I think that's really important and we're putting a lot of effort. As you can imagine, a lot of those activities right now are still virtually being done, especially in certain markets around the world. But if you look at what we're doing, in particular, in the vaccine area, I think you may be have seen some of our non-branded commercial activities to raise awareness about the importance of HPV vaccination. You can see that we are continuing to put a lot of effort behind KEYTRUDA with healthcare professionals, as well as with our consumer campaigns and activities. And we also are in many markets around the world, continuing to engage in educational programs to make sure that physicians are well aware of a lot of the new data that you've heard Roger speak about here this morning. So we have significant efforts around the world and that's why we're confident in our overall growth profile, as we look towards not only the rest of this year as we head into 2021."

Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Laura and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2020 conference call. Today I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Roger Perlmutter, President of Merck Research Laboratories; Frank Clyburn, Chief Commercial Officer; and Mike Nally, our Chief Marketing Officer. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs [indiscernible] you should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. We have also provided a table in our press release to help you understand the sales in the quarter for the business units and products.

Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with some highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Frazier: Thank you, Peter. Good morning. And thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by thanking all employees around the world for demonstrating resiliency and diligence through this difficult time. As a result of their tireless work, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities and we exited the quarter with accelerating business momentum. While the pandemic has brought challenges that few of us could have imagined, even six months ago, it has also demonstrated the critical importance of organizations that are focused on breakthrough science. Our scientists are highly focused on this effort and we are incredibly energized by this mission. Simply put, this is why Merck exists. Throughout the quarter, Merck executed well, both operationally in support of our existing portfolio and by advancing our innovative research program. We continue to perform at a very high level, without significant disruption to the production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products, or our clinical trial. As expected social distancing measures in many regions negatively impacted second quarter volume for many of us product. However, customer access to care is steadily improving, including in our portfolio of vaccines, which was hit particularly hard this quarter. We remain confident that our innovative portfolio will drive strong, long-term growth.  Our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including continuing to invest in internal R&D and business development. In addition to advancing our strategic priority, we also achieved significant progress on our plans, spin off Organon & Co., which remains on track be completed in the first half of 2021. We remain confident that creating two more focused companies will result in each being stronger and better positioned in an evolving healthcare landscape, which will benefit the patients we serve and our shareholders. We recently announced the appointment of several talented and experienced leaders from outside the company to the strong leadership team. And they are already deeply engaged in driving the various work streams underway to set up the standalone company for success.  Before Roger provides more detail, I'd like to say a few words on the multiple efforts underway within Merck on the COVID-19 front. COVID-19 represents a tremendous challenge to the biopharmaceutical research community. And Merck is moving with urgency to apply our deep expertise in vaccines and infectious diseases towards potential solutions. During the quarter, we announced two vaccine development efforts, one through a collaboration with IAVI and the other through a now completed acquisition of Themis. We selected these candidates because they are based on proven platforms that we anticipate will lead safe, effective and broadly deployable vaccine with the promise of single dosage. Both vaccine candidates will soon enter the clinic, and we have begun investing to facilitate our ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses. We also announced a program to develop a novel, orally available, antiviral candidate through a collaboration with Ridgeback Bio. This compound has advanced into Phase 2 clinical trial. We are optimistic about the prospects with these three programs and if successful, Merck is committed to working with others to create broad, affordable, and equitable global access. These programs illustrate our continued commitment to supplementing internal capabilities with innovative external science project. Roger will provide more details on the significant progress being made in our research activities elsewhere. More broadly, the biopharmaceutical industry's response to COVID-19 has been extraordinary. Our industry is uniquely positioned to address this public health challenge on a global scale. Collaboration across the scientific, public health and biopharmaceutical industry community will be key to success and to help ensure that we are adequately prepared for the next. We are confident that science will ultimately prevail over COVID-19 with new medicines and vaccines. Let me conclude by expressing our gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers, as well as to our own employees, who have worked to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires us and makes us even more resolute in our commitment to bring forward new tools to help end this pandemic. The value of our industry to society is underscored by this crisis as is the need for companies like Merck, continue to invest in research and development to address the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll pass it over to my colleague, Rob Davis, to review the details of our performance and our outlook.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Ken and good morning, everyone. As Ken highlighted, our business performed well in an unprecedented environment, while we saw a meaningful impact in the COVID pandemic in the quarter, particularly in April and May overall the business went well. Within our human health business, the impact is largely expected while within animal health, the impact was less than anticipated. That said we were able to deliver better than expected results in both human health and animal health due to our underlying operational strength combined with our execution in the face of the pandemic. Based on our ability to drive improved and accelerating operational momentum, we now expect to see stronger performance in the second half of the year. As a point of reference, if we adjust for the impact of COVID in the quarter, Merck's underlying sales growth would have been 6% nominally and 9% excluding exchange, reflecting strong demand for key growth pillars. We continue to operate from a position of financial and operational strength, which allowed us to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Investments behind our extensive pipeline of research programs remained robust and we also successfully completed two collaborations and an acquisition to bring in-house promising vaccines and antiviral candidates to address the COVID-19 pandemic as Ken referenced. All of this is in support of or goal of advancing science to fulfill unmet medical needs, the core of Merck's mission. Now turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% year-over-year or 5% excluding the negative impact in foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our second quarter results by $1.6 billion, reflecting approximately $1.5 billion in human health and approximately a $100 million in animal health. In the human health business, the impact to sales was spread to varying degrees across our vaccines, hospitals, women's health and oncology products due to access limitations from social distancing orders and prioritization of coronavirus patients and hospitals. Within the animal health segment, livestock product sales were impacted by a change in protein demand through the restaurant closures and regional outbreaks, while companion animal product sales reflected decreased visits to veterinarian offices. It's worth noting that despite the short term headwinds experienced in the quarter, the underlying strength and demand for our products enabled first half growth of 4% excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments will focus on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an exchange basis. Our human health revenues declined 6%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 31% year-over-year, reaching $3.4 billion in the quarter. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA demonstrated strong growth across all key tumor types. We continue to strengthen our leadership in IO, including in lung in the face of recent competitor launches. We benefited from continued strength in melanoma, bladder, and head and neck cancers and strong momentum from launches in renal cell and in the matriarchal carcinomas. We received FDA approval for a six-week dosing regimen across all adult indications, which enabled greater patient access and contributed to growth. Outside the U.S., lung cancer indications, remains a driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with reimbursement secured across all major markets. In Japan, the combined impact of delay in new patient starts, reduced frequency of existing patients and a huge seller price adjustments from February and April, more than offset volume growth in new indications. We saw COVID-related impact to KEYTRUDA in April and May across all tumor types, but not to the degree we expected. We were encouraged by the recoveries we saw in June, particularly in the United States and Europe. And this trend has continued in the third quarter. Strong growth in Lynparza and selumetinib continue to bolster our oncology performance as both products experienced limited pandemic impacts this performance in the quarter continues to reflect growth in leadership and the PARP class in the United States and the recent launches of the PAOLA-1 in ovarian cancer and PROfound in prostate cancer, provide opportunities for future growth. Lenvima maintains market leadership in first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA and endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading treatment regimen in the second line setting in the United States. Turning now to vaccines, our vaccines portfolio was negatively impacted by a reduction of patient visits to physicians offices in line with our expectations. GARDASIL sales declined 24% year-over-year, driven by stay-at-home workers in the United States and most of European markets, partially offset by continued demand driven core strength in China. In the United States, we were encouraged to see significant increase in wellness visits beginning in late April for children and in late June for adults, and anticipate this trend will lead to a recovery in our vaccines business in the back half of the year. Our hospital business was impacted by delays and cancellations of elective surgeries and prioritization of coronavirus patients in hospitals. This impacted sales of BRIDION, which declined 18% year-over-year. Reduced wholesale or inventories also contributed to the decline. We remain confident in the underlying demand for BRIDION and are encouraged by the ongoing recovery in overall surgical procedure volumes. Partially offsetting the decline in our hospital portfolio was the growth in provames. Animal health revenue increased 3% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 3% due to contributions from an acquisition in our animal health intelligence product line. And companion animal also grew 3%, reflecting strong growth at the productive line of products. Visits to veterinarian offices were negatively impacted early in the quarter, but offices opened earlier than expected, which benefited volumes. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 160, driven largely by catch up amortization for expected milestone achievements for our collaborations on Lynparza and selumetinib. Operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. In total, COVID resulted in reduced spending of approximately $325 million, driven largely by lower promotional, selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel and meeting expenses.  The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized equity gains from our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investments in Moderna and MGM.  The tax rate for the quarter of 15% was driven by lower full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taking together, we earned $1.37 cents per share, an increase of 9% excluding exchange. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As expected April was a particularly challenging month in the human health business. As we moved through May and particularly through June, however, we saw a meaningful increase in patient wellness business to providers and in elective surgeries of hospitals. And our oncology business was particularly resilient due to the strength and breadth of our offerings.  Business conditions have clearly improved and despite increased outbreaks and infection rates that are impacting the phasing of our recovery, we believe the healthcare system is better positioned to provide patient access as we move through the balance of the year. The improved underlying operational strength we are seeing across several parts of our portfolio will help to more than offset the impact from COVID-19 and lead to stronger expected second half growth. In addition, when we were benefiting from our prior investments in digital capabilities to interact with our patients, providers and payors, allowing us to continue to address medical inquiries and promote our products effectively. This gives us further confidence in our ability to drive efficiencies in our business as we adapt to a post-COVID world through our continuing digital and other transformation efforts. On the Animal Health side, as mentioned, veterinarian offices opened earlier than initially expected, which benefits our companion animal products and stay at home restrictions lifted sooner than anticipated, which positively impacts our livestock products. These favorable trends contributed to our better than expected second quarter results and favorably impacted our outlook to the full year. We will continue to monitor regional outbreaks, restaurant and school openings and any potential impacts to for our demand livestock products. Now turning to guidance, our updated guidance reflects continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business, a more limited COVID impact and previously expected [indiscernible] business as a whole and a more favorable FX environment. Our assumptions regarding the progression of the COVID impact remain unchanged. We assume that the largest impact from COVID occurred in the second quarter, which recovery haven\u2019t begun during the second quarter that will continue through the third quarter, before return to normal operating levels in the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues of $47.2 billion to $48.7 billion, which reflects an increase of $850 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance now seems roughly $1.95 billion of COVID headwind for the year. This is a reduction from our prior assumption of $2.1 billion, which human health roughly in line with and animal health below our prior estimates. We now assume a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-July rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 6% growth in revenue for the full-year, excluding the impact of exchange, reflecting strong underlying demand for our products. The one area we are watching is vaccines and GARDASIL in particular for a potential extended recovery timeline. However, this risk has been fully considered within our guidance range and more than offset by the overall strength we expect to see across the rest of our portfolio. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to be roughly flat year-over-year, reflecting increased R&D spend offset by reduced SG&A cost. The increase in our OpEx assumptions versus previous guidance reflect spending in R&D associated with the acceleration of our COVID-19 programs. This guidance still implies operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points for the year. We now expect a full year tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $550 million before I can hire unrealized gains in our equity securities portfolio based on June 30th valuations. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taking together we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.63 to $5.78 which reflects an increase of $0.44 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our results are benefiting from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. Excluding these benefits, however, we continue to drive operational leverage in the P&L. Revenue growth coupled with continued expense management, while we invest in R&D including our COVID-19 candidates and capacity expansion is expected to drive operating margin expansion to the full year. Our cash flow generation and access to capital both are strong, and we remain well positioned to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including full investment behind our key growth drivers and pipeline. Continued commitment to the dividend and strategic value enhancement business development to enhance our pipeline and long-term growth potential. To conclude, we remained competent in the fundamentals of the business and the meaningful growth opportunities that lie ahead, despite the near-term impact from the pandemic. A favorable recovery trend that we saw through the quarter positions our company for accelerating business momentum as we head into the back half of the year. The underlying health of the business and demand for innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines remains strong. This combined with our strong clinical execution across the portfolio and our expanding indications, which Roger will highlight in a moment continues to reinforce our confidence and the sustainability and strength of our revenue growth. During these challenging times, we are leveraging our operational and financial strength, not only to weather the storm, but also to execute meaningfully on our strategy of innovation and our mission to bring new medicines to patients. We continue to believe this best positions Merck for a success and value creation long into the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Perlmutter: Thank you, Rob. During the second quarter, we were able to expand laboratory operations beyond the essential production of materials for clinical trials, such that we are now once again selecting new chemical entities in discovery research and advancing these materials in preclinical testing. As our laboratories reopen, our priorities remains first ensuring the safety of our employees; and second, ensuring the patients in our clinical trials receive their treatments and are managed appropriately; and finally, we are once again applying our skills to identify new medicines and vaccines. Many programs that I highlighted in my remarks during our first quarter earnings call made substantial progress. For example, in May we received FDA approval for Lynparza developed in collaboration with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, when used in combination with bevacizumab for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who sustained a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose tumors demonstrate deficiency in homologous recombination based on results from an FDA approved diagnostic test. This approval referenced a biomarker subgroup analysis of the Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial in which Lynparza plus bevacizumab improved median progression-free survival by more than two fold to 37.2 months. Lynparza also received FDA approval in May for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and also contain deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair gene mutations. This approval was based on results of our Phase 3 PROfound study. We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer have tumors containing these kinds of mutations. Later in the quarter, Lynparza gained a positive opinion from the CHMP for use in the first-line maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whose tumors contain germline BRCA mutations, based on the POLO study. This recommendation was ratified by the European commission early in July. KEYTRUDA was the subject of numerous important regulatory actions in the second quarter, such that the FDA label is now nearly 100 pages in length and tabulate nearly 30 explicit approvals. I will not enumerate all of the regulatory activity associated with KEYTRUDA filings today, but we'll note that the second quarter began with the approval by the FDA of an extended dosing interval, 400 milligrams every six weeks for all adult indications. Though previously registered in Europe approval of this new dosing schedule in the United States offers positions and options to reduce the number of clinic visits that patients must attend to at a time when they have implemented important social distancing measures. In June, the FDA granted three additional approvals for KEYTRUDA. First, for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that cannot be cured by surgery or radiation therapy. Second, for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer in patients whose tumors show evidence of mismatch repair deficient or MSI-high. And third, for the second line treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory treatment options provided that the tumors show a high mutational burden of at least 10 mutations per megabase of DNA. I wish to note here that this is the second tumor agnostic indication for KEYTRUDA. We received the very first such indication in the history of oncology therapeutics in 2017 with the accelerated approval of our MSI-high indication for KEYTRUDA in adults with solid tumors. As I just mentioned, this approach was extended still further in June with the approval for first-line treatment of MSI-high colorectal cancer, based on our KEYNOTE-177 trial. FDA approval for the second line treatment of patients whose tumors show a high tumor mutational burden represents the second time that KEYTRUDA has received an indication based on the molecular characteristics of the tumors themselves rather than the cell or organ from which these tumors are believed to have originated Two other FDA approvals from the second quarter deserves special mention. GARDASIL 9 was approved for the prevention of Human Papillomavirus related oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers. This was an accelerated approval, based on the effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 in preventing Papillomavirus-related anogenital disease and was supported by studies showing clearance of persistent oropharyngeal HPV infection index needs. A recent analysis by the U.S. centers for disease control, demonstrated that HPV attributable oropharyngeal cancer has now surpassed cervical cancer as the most prevalent form of HPV related cancer in the United States, approval in the head and neck cancer setting was the result of decades of investigation pursued by Merck Research Laboratories. We also received FDA approval for RECARBRIO for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms. As COVID-19 hospitalizations increased the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia becomes more profound. RECARBRIO provides an important new antibiotic that can be especially helpful in treating infections due to pseudomonas species. Beyond these regulatory approvals, we continue to support \u2013 to submit important new files. For example, during the second quarter we filed the results of the VICTORIA study conducted in partnership with Bayer, which demonstrated that vericiguat, our novel orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase activator reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization when added to standard therapy in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure following a worsening event. These data were previously presented at the American College of cardiology meetings in the spring. The FDA has granted priority review to this application, reflecting the significant unmet need for new therapies in the heart failure population. In the oncology area, we also submitted for review our data from the KEYNOTE-355 and KEYNOTE-522 studies, which document the activity of KEYTRUDA in triple negative breast cancer either as second line treatment in combination with chemotherapy that in KEYNOTE-355 or as an adjunct to surgery in the neoadjuvant setting in combination with chemotherapy followed by monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting, that is the KEYNOTE-522 study. We announced yesterday, the acceptance of both files for review by the FDA, and here was well the KEYNOTE-355 file was granted priority review. This week we also announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough designation to MK-6482, our Novel HIF-2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease associated renal cell carcinoma based on data that we presented at the American society for clinical oncology meetings in June. Finally, our broad portfolio of activities in cardiovascular medicine, oncology and in infectious diseases now includes three new programs directed at interdicting the COVID-19 pandemic. As you are aware, during the second quarter we've forged a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop MK-4482 in nucleoside analog that disrupts the faithful replication of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. MK-4482 has now been studied in ascending dose protocol and has been shown to be well tolerated during five-day oral administration achieving drug levels that we would expect would be more than sufficient to block viral replication. The compound is currently under study in three different Phase 2 programs in outpatients, as well as in inpatients here in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Based partially on the results of these studies, we expect to initiate two large pivotal trials, one in outpatients and the second in hospitalized COVID-19 patients beginning in September. We are also in discussions with the active consortium to begin a large Phase 2 outpatient study conducted under the supervision of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. MK-4482 has demonstrated a strong barrier to resistance when studied in vitro, which was to be expected based on its mechanism of action. It is for example, active against viruses that have acquired mutations, rendering them resistant to remdesivir. In light of the profound medical need for an orally active treatment to reduce the impact of COVID-19, we have mounted a very aggressive clinical program as I described. And we have secured manufacturing capability to produce many millions of doses of the drug before the end of this year. At the same time, we're answering two important new vaccines directed against SARS-CoV-2. These vaccine approaches were selected for three reasons as Ken mentioned. First, they make use of proven vaccine platforms that have been used in human studies demonstrating both efficacy and safety. Second, they are replicating viral-vaccines, which means that they provide a very potent immune stimulus that could offer the promise of single dose administration. In dealing with an aggressive globally dispersed disease like COVID-19, we believe that it is wise to lower the barrier to vaccination as much as possible. For example by launching a vaccine that is effective with just a single administration. Third, since we believe that there may well be a need for different vaccines in different populations, we chose two well-characterized vaccine platforms that have quite different properties. A measles virus recombinant that was invented by the Institut Pasteur in Paris, and which we acquired through the purchase of Themis Bioscience and a vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant first developed by Health Canada, which we're advancing in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IAVI. As this construct utilizes the same virus platform that we employed to develop our successful Ebola virus vaccine, which was registered in the United States earlier this year. In preclinical studies, both of these COVID-19 vaccine constructs have now been shown to stimulate neutralizing antibody production following a single intramuscular administration. Our program using the measles virus vaccine platform, which we call V591 has not completed clinical manufacturing. And we plan to begin clinical studies performed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur later this quarter. Meanwhile, we've been manufacturing clinical doses of the VSV-based COVID-19 vaccine, which we call V590 in our facilities in Pennsylvania. We also expect to begin clinical studies with V590 in the next few months. Planning for large global clinical trials involving both V590 and V591 is now nearly complete. These trials will initiate as soon as we have supportive data regarding immunogenicity. Finally, I note that one additional advantage of V590 is that it may be active when administered orally via a swish and swallow protocol. And again, this will help to lower the barrier to vaccination should it be affective. It should be playing that Merck Research Laboratories continues to advance development of new drugs and vaccines across many fronts. In this context, I wish specifically to commend the dedication of more than 10,000 MRL employees around the globe whose supererogatory efforts have again brought us hope that the world can gain greater freedom from greivous illness. Reviewing the progress that we have made in developing MK-4482 and both of our COVID-19 vaccines, I am optimistic that we will be able to reduce the impact of this devastating pendant. And now I'll turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Eric, if you could put the Q&A order in place, please, and I'll just remind questioners to limit yourself to one or two questions as always. We have a lot of questioners in the queue and we are prepared to extend a bit past nine to try to get to as many as we can. A couple of our speakers today are remote. So I'll do the best I can to quarterback those questions when they come in. Laura.\nOperator: Thank you so much sir. Let me go ahead and begin with your first question for today, which is going to be coming from Mr. Andrew Baum of Citi. Sir, your line is now live. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Two questions. First one, we can see from your clinical trials that there's significant cold expansion going on in several of your programs and one that's been taken about, but also little [indiscernible] and there's a number of others, which suggests that you're seeing signs and promising activity. Can you give us some sense just because the market is so very focused on the importance of KEYTRUDA, when you may be exiting to share some of that emerging Phase II data and extend into cardiology as well? That'd be the first question, timing of sharing. And I'm not expecting you to give me which confidence or when, but as much as you can. And then second, given the perceived competitive KEYTRUDA, particularly in non-small cell, you have an ongoing trial with Lynparza in the maintenance setting. So perhaps Roger, you could talk to your optimism in that because you're obviously drawing that in other indications in sensitive disease and particularly whether you could address \u2013 do you think you need to select for patients who have [indiscernible] loss of HIV genes or whether you think just come [indiscernible] use together with the sales, which are [indiscernible] sufficient? So those are the two questions. Thank you.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Roger, I think those are both for you. If you...\nRoger Perlmutter: Yes. Andrew, thank you for the questions. I think that in some sense, questions are related, if I caught them correctly, and I apologize the fact that I'm remote. And so the connection is perhaps not as clear as I would like it to be. But with respect to the expansion of clinical trials for a whole variety of new agents, we're seeing some interesting activity. Some of these data we'll, we hope, be able to present at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meetings, which are coming up in September. And we'll have additional opportunities we hope through towards the end of the year to talk about these data. And these data go precisely to the issue that you raised with non-small cell lung cancer. Now first, I should mention that, as you know, we have an extremely strong data set in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA is very active in that setting and active in combination with chemotherapy as we've shown. And that remains a hugely important intervention, the dominant intervention in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, either as monotherapy in the PD-L1 high population or in combination therapy. That said, you're also looking at activity of these new agents directed at a whole variety of different checkpoints in multiple cellular components as well as looking at the issue of mismatch repair deficiency in combination with KEYTRUDA. We're optimistic that we will begin to segregate non-small cell lung cancer patients still further on the basis of the fundamental properties of the tumors, and this goes precisely to our efforts in both MSI-high and tumor mutational burden in order to achieve still better results in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. So suffice it to say, we're extremely active in this area and generating a lot of very interesting data and hope to have a chance to present it to you very soon.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you. Next question please Laura.\nOperator: Absolutely. Your next question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you so much. My questions of COVID with two parts, if I may. Roger, you've probably been seeing a lot of the first round of COVID vaccine data so far. And without really commenting on any single company, I'm curious how you view the data and totality to date of all the clinical data on COVID vaccine? Perhaps specifically on whether you think the neutralizing titers that various layers have shown are good enough? Or do you a lot see of room for improvement and your take on the T-cell data? And also on your small molecule for COVID, do you think you can show an antiviral benefit? Because that's something Remdesivir was never able to achieve. But then there's also this school of thought that there's no large viremia in COVID, or you may not be able to show that in the first place. So I really appreciate your thoughts there.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Roger?\nRoger Perlmutter: Yes. Thank you, Umer. The \u2013 so, first of all, with respect to the COVID vaccine data, we have to say that from our starting position, knowing very little about SARS-CoV-2 to at the beginning. The results that we've seen thus far from a variety of early studies, Phase I studies, are as good as one could hope for, really. There was no guarantee that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 would prove to be as immunogenic as it is. So immune response, broadly speaking, across the population of vaccinees are quite good. The question you asked is, is there enough neutralizing antibody and how well we have to perform clinically. And unfortunately, we can't really know that until we look at Phase III studies. But I guess I would say first that, as has been discussed by others, most of the vaccines look as if they are going to be require a boost in order to produce high titer neutralizing activity against the spike protein. That seems clear. We don't know for sure, and maybe things will go better, which we can all hope for. With time, we'll see more of that. The second question, of course, is the production of immune response against the spike protein sufficient by itself? Or is it necessary to generate responses against other components of the virus, particularly the nuclear protein? And then, of course, there is the question of what contribution is made by T cell immunity. And a little bit that goes to the question of what we're actually trying to achieve. Finally, in the background is the question of whether the immune stimulation that we are producing could, in fact, contribute to adverse effects since it is widely believed that the severe pulmonary complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection include an overexuberant immune response that results in tissue destruction. So those are all open questions that can only be answered by large Phase 3 studies that extend for a considerable period of time. Those studies at least have begun now in a couple of cases. More will begin soon. And we'll have a chance to see exactly how these vaccines perform. I don't think at the moment, we can handicap it except to say that it is certainly a favorable finding that the spike protein in its various different forms, typically as a prefusion form or it's hoped it is a prefusion form, seems to be quite immunogenic, and there are reasonable titers of antibodies being produced. So that should give us considerable optimism. I should also say, I \u2013 we \u2013 the broader industry is collaborating and thinking about these problems in how to make sufficient doses available. And I think the community at large should be very encouraged by the enormous numbers of vaccine doses that are being planned for, for manufacturing, particularly as we get into 2021 and beyond. If these vaccines are effective, I think the industry is going to be able to produce enough material, ultimately, to provide vaccination for a substantial fraction of the world's population.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Roger. I think there is a second question on 4482.\nRoger Perlmutter: Right. So the second question is, would we see an antiviral benefit with MK-4482? It's important to note here that MK-4482 differs in mechanism quite a lot from Remdesivir. Remdesivir, of course, is a RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitor. It caused determination. Whereas MK-4482 is a cytosine analog that is incorporated, and as a result, causes misincorporation of bases into the nascent RNA. Those RNAs are produced, but they contain many, many errors, and the result is something called aero catastrophe, which is a very powerful means of preventing production of functional virus. So those are two quite different mechanisms. The expectation is that there would be production of virus at least for a period of time, but that virus would not be able to replicate. I think from, from a variety of in-vitro studies, it is possible to measure a dramatic reduction in virus production. And we may see the same thing in our clinical studies. We are, of course, looking for it. The Phase 2 studies are underway. So it won't take too long until we have a chance to see that. We are, of course, as well measuring clinical outcomes.\nUmer Raffat: Thank you very much.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Umer.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks. Maybe two from me. Just one follow-up on the oral antiviral for COVID2. I was just wondering if you can comment on when we might expect to see some of the initial Phase II data and then how you're defining success on that front. And then the second question I had was for Rob. Just wondering the outlook for capital allocation for the rest of the year if the share program is still on hold? And if that, as a result, you're intending to be more active on the business development front here over the near term? Thank you.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Roger?\nRoger Perlmutter: Right. For MK-4482, I think that the we \u2013 I don't really want to dribble out data on this. As we acquire meaningful data from the Phase II program, well, of course, let you know. But I should point out that we will be embarking probably in September on very large pivotal studies. And so those are going to be the important ones. And here, the goal has to be that with this orally active drug, that we can both reduce the duration of symptoms, but more importantly, key people who are symptomatic from becoming sick enough that they require hospitalization or if hospitalized, that they require intensive care unit hospitalization. The good news about MK-4482 is that it \u2013 because it is an oral drug given in capsules, it can be easily administered from the time that people have symptoms. And so that, I think, could mean that we could have a meaningful effect on the clinical outcomes. And that, of course, has to be the goal of therapy.\nPeter Dannenbaum: And Rob, on capital allocation.\nRob Davis: Yes. Good morning. So, as you pointed out, we did stop this share repurchase after the first quarter, and all we did that really out of an abundance of caution because we weren't sure how do you would progress. I'm happy to report, and as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our cash flow actually remains very strong. And our access to capital is also very strong. I think we demonstrated that in a recent debt offering at record low rates. So from that position, we're in a good position. As we think about share repurchase for the remainder of the year, we continue to evaluate it. Business development is very important to us. So I obviously put a priority on making sure we have the capital necessary for business development to fund the business itself and the meaningful capital expansion were underway as well as all of the important programs that we've talked about. So we're looking at all of that and continuing to evaluate whether or not we will restart in the remainder of the year.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Laura.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you for that. We have your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question I have here is, in light of the pandemic and ahead of the 2020 presidential election, how did the environment for M&A look? How are valuations? And what is the willingness of sellers? And the second question I had for you is assuming you get approval of V114 and the rest of your PCV portfolio, how do you see Merck fitting into the treatment paradigm for PCV? Is this a winner-take-all market? And will things change if these PCV24 is actually make it to market? Thank you.\nKen Frazier: So, I\u2019ll start off with the business development question, Louise. Thanks for the question. As Rob said, this business development remains a really important priority for us now and going forward. Right now, I think the environment which we are in is still a tough one in the sense that as you look at the first half of the year, the Biotech IPO market has outpaced last year, despite all the challenges associated with COVID, despite all the concerns that might happen with respect to the election. And of course, established biotech has also performed very well this year. So I think the challenge for us is to find the best scientific capability in a way that's value-creating for our shareholders. And right now, I think seller expectations are very high, notwithstand the issues around the political landscape, the executive orders and everything else. So I think at the end of the day, we still have to continue to search for the best clients commensurate with the need to create value for our shareholders. And I don't think the election is a critical factor there.\nPeter Dannenbaum: And Mike Nally, do you want to report.\nMike Nally: Hi, Louise. On V114, I think what's really important here is for any future PCV vaccine, the first and foremost, continue to suppress \u2013 or continue to generate an immune response across all the 13 shared serotypes with current PCV13 vaccine and then add on additional serotypes. What we've seen with V114 is we've been very successful in doing so in both the adult and pediatric segment. As we look forward, we think there's room for multiple options within the PCV market. I think you can look at market like rotavirus is a good analog where despite having different profiles and different coverage profiles, we have basically a shared market with both Rotarix and with Rotateq. And so as we look forward, we think there's a big unmet need bill in this market. We think V114 will play a major role in that, and we continue to look at alternate options in the future with both V116 as well as V117.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Louise. Next question please, Laura.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. I have two questions for Roger, please. First, regarding the Ridgeback Bio oral antiviral, what is your view on the risk of immunogenicity? And how do you plan to demonstrate to FDA that it has acceptable safety with respect to the action of the drug? And second, Merck has very sophisticated understanding of mRNA vaccines. Could you please discuss why Merck chose not to pursue mRNA vaccine development for COVID? And I know you touched on that a little bit, but just a little more color on that would be helpful. And between the two Merck candidates, maybe you could just highlight for us, which one we should be more focused on? Thank you.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Roger?\nRoger Perlmutter: Well, thank you, David. First of all, from the MK-4482 as you know that the compound is aims positive, that's in a way not unexpected given its mechanism of action, it is a cytosine analog. So that one could expect to see those kinds of things. The question is does the compound have mutagenic activities that's meaningful in mammalian cells and what we want to do about this. Ordinarily, of course, we don't want to take mutagens forward into clinical practice, although it has been done where the benefit risk profile makes sense. With respect to this compound, we should note that in other tests, for example, the in vitro and in vivo micronucleus test that the compound is negative. We're doing other in vivo tests for mutagenesis in mammalian systems. And we'll do the usual kinds of preclinical evaluations that are conducted in such settings which includes a development on reproductive toxicology studies and of course accelerated carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Those are the things that one customarily does and my expectation is that when you look at the totality of data, that benefit risk profile for a short term course in treating an acute pulmonary infection will be favorable. And of course, that has been seen before. So it is something that we pay a lot of attention to. But on the other hand, I think, something that we can overcome. With respect to MRNA vaccines you're right we have quite a bit of experience, which we gained from working with our colleagues at Moderna, in looking at MRA vaccination. And I think there are some great strengths to MRA vaccination in particular, it's quite fast as both Moderna and Beyontec now working with Pfizer had demonstrated one can move very quickly from knowing the sequence, the genetic sequence of a potential target to developing an immunogen. On the other hand, our concern from the beginning was that this was going to be a pandemic. We felt that way long before WHO declared it a pandemic. We had no idea it would be as severe and as widely dispersed as it has proved to be, it is a threat to the entire world. And none of us are safe until we're all safe, as everyone says. And with that in mind, the need will be to mount effective vaccination for a large fraction of human population. There are several aspects of that that are important to emphasize. The first of course, as I've said, is it is nice to have a single dose vaccine. It would also be nice to have a vaccine that could be administered orally in the way that, for example, not that this is directly relevant the same in oral vaccine and came to replace the original polio vaccine. And in addition, we should recognize that there are many different populations who are infected. Of course, everyone is ultimately infected, but we have an elderly population at extremely high risk, particularly those who have underlying cardiovascular disease. And those individuals, the elderly population, tend not to respond as well. So under those circumstances [indiscernible], and especially in potent immunogen that was a reason for wanting to choose a replicating viral platform, in addition to our desire to have a single dose. We also have children, and adolescents and those in their third decade of life who are currently being infected in very high numbers. And we have a lot of people in robust, early adulthood who are ending up in the intensive care unit. Those people have extremely potent immune responses, but that\u2019s important to get neutralization amounted quite early, I believe, in that population. So that could be a different kind of virus, maybe not the same one you would use in the adult population, as a vaccine, a different kind of viral vaccine. And the answer to the question of which one of these should we pay attention to, I think, I'm paying attention to both. We will get information from the measles platform earlier. And of course the measles platform, the measles vaccine has been used successfully in billions of people. So we have a lot of confidence in the way that will behave. We just need to see immunogenicity data. I would say, pre-clinically, it looks terrific. And then of course, we have a lot of confidence in the USP platform, which we've investigated extensively through the course of our registration program for Ebola virus vaccine. So I've watched them both. And I think that they're potentially quite important.\nKen Frazier: Thank you. Next question, please, Lauer. And we're going to fix [indiscernible], to try to get as many questions in as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: Absolutely, thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez form Guggenheim. Your line is now live please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks very much. So Roger I did want to just follow-up on EIDD-2801 or Merck\u2019s new number MK-4482. But more so as a potential treatment for other respiratory retroviruses, can you just maybe help us understand if you believe that this is a potential treatment in those setting and if there is broader, potential for this particular mechanism? And then second I did want to ask actually about your HIV program, MK-8591. I believe Merck was hoping to have another agent to marry the MK-8591 to optimize the treatment opportunity. Would you mind just maybe updating us on that in the context of identifying longer acting treatment regimen? And then separately just on the robustness of the data for some other agents in the prep regimen maybe you can just update us on your thoughts around MK-8591 as a potential best-in-class treatment choice for prep? Thanks.\nKen Frazier: Take you chance Roger.\nRoger Perlmutter: Yes, Seamus thanks for the questions. For MK-4482, you're right, you're completely right, because of its mechanism-of-action, that it resembles a nucleoside base. It\u2019s in fact, just a derivatized version of a cytosine. It can be incorporated into any nascent RNA strain that is made by an appropriate virus. It's just a function of how well the viral polymerase is willing to accept the modified base. And just as one expects a virus is built for speed, typically viruses their RNA polymerases for RNA viruses are more accommodating of different structures than our mammalian DNA-dependent RNA polymerases involved in making messenger RNA, for example. And so it has good selectivity and good properties in that regard and should work very well for a whole variety of RNA viruses in vitro, it does exactly that. So a whole set of RNA viruses could potentially be treated, including, broadly speaking coronaviruses that we haven't yet made the acquaintance of. We don't really want to make the acquaintance of these, but our expectation is that this is not our last pandemic and probably not the last pandemic caused by coronavirus. So MK-4482 has broad activity and is potentially useful in a variety of different settings. Let's first see how it does with respect to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding islatravir, we have \u2013 of course, we remain enormously enthusiastic about islatravir Phase 3 studies are ongoing for the first set of combinations for islatravir for treatment of HIV infected individuals. And we've also, as you say, been looking for compounds to partner with islatravir, and we have such compounds. One of them moving forward right now is MK-8507. And we also have a group of others. So we believe that we're in a good place with respect to those. But we're moving forward in a variety of different directions. And then with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, yes, because the long durability of islatravir, the potential for a once monthly oral in particular, which could be used anywhere in the world, I think, is extremely attractive. But beyond that, as we've shown, islatravir can be formulated in a implantable form, which is a polymer that is positioned underneath the skin and can be active for potentially a year. And that provides, just about as close to perfect chemoprophylaxis as one can get, it's nearly vaccine like. So we're pursuing that as well, and we're optimistic about the ability of islatravir to make a big change in terms of the prevalence of HIV-mediated disease and the incidence of HIV infection.\nKen Frazier: Thank you, Seamus. Next question, please, Laura.\nOperator: Absolutely, thank you, sir. Your next question will come from the line of Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. You can go ahead, please. Your line is now live.\nDaina Graybosch: Thank you very much for the question two from me. I wonder why you are so confident on both your COVID vaccine candidates that they could be a single dose, when, let's say, the chip adding a viral vector, which, I think, we also thought to be a single dose, looks much better with two doses in the early clinical data. And the second question just following-up on one from earlier is are you looking to choose between the two vaccine programs as you get clinical data, or do you expect to bring both of them all the way through to registration, maybe finding different places for them in the market? Thank you.\nKen Frazier: Roger?\nRoger Perlmutter: Yes, thanks for those questions. So we have a lot of confidence in the single dose activity of both vaccines, because these are replicating vaccines. So they replicate in you, they are very potent immunogens and they have single dose activity, single administration activity in other settings. So of course, with V590, that's the vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine. That has been demonstrated for Ebola virus disease very effectively. A single dose provides in the field in the setting of civil strife of a large magnitude, greater than 97.5% efficacy in a single dose. Now, I can't tell you that that's exactly that it will behave when we put a different gene in this case SARS-CoV-2 spike protein spike protein encoding nucleic acids into the construct. But the interesting thing about the VSV platform is that this is actually a vaccine in which the spike protein becomes part of the vaccine, the replication of the virus is completely dependent upon the spike protein, it becomes the envelope protein that the vaccine which is different from simply expressing the protein, wherever one expresses it. So that has big effects. And pre-clinically the magnitude of the response on single administration is very impressive. Similarly, the measles platform has been shown in a variety of different settings most recently with respect to the chikungunya administration to be a very potent immunogen. We have a lot of competence in that. And with respect to Y2, as I've said, there is reason to believe that multiple different vaccines will be required in order to manage this extraordinary global pandemic. In particular, when one thinks about the heterogeneity of the population that we want to vaccinate, those with extremely robust immune responses, for example, teenagers or those in their 20s, those in the elderly population at greatest risk, but we have poor immune responses just to give a couple of examples. There is also reason in terms of just the ability to deliver the vaccine to different parts of the globe and to administer it successfully as part of a huge global vaccination program. And so our intention at the moment is not to choose, but to instead examine the special properties of each of these very good platforms and then to see which one needs to be taken forward first and in which population and which perhaps second, although both could be advanced simultaneous.\nKen Frazier: Thank you, Daina. We're going to take one more question and apologies to those of you that we didn't get to today.\nOperator: Thank you sir. You next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now live, go ahead please.\nChris Schott: All right great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just a couple ones here. First on, KEYTRUDA, are you seeing fairly normalized new patients starts in major markets at this point, or is there still some disruptions there? And maybe it's part of that answer, you just give us a quick update in terms of where kind of market share and penetration stands in frontline lung? And then my second question was on the vaccine business and wellness visits. Are we also kind of at normalized levels as we move through July at this point? Are you anticipating any catch-up as we go later in the year for some of the missed vaccinations from 2Q? Thanks so much,\nKen Frazier: Frank?\nFrank Clyburn: Yes, Chris good morning. For Keytruda, we are very encouraged, especially over the last month. We are seeing new patient starts get back to where they were almost pre-COVID. If you look at what happened in the quarter, Chris, April and May new patient starts were down somewhere in the range about 5% to 10%, depending on the cancer type, but that has improved. And we're seeing that pretty much around the world where oncologists are now figuring out ways to be able to get patients into their practices. That's going to vary by geographies. There will be some ups and downs around that, but all in all oncology has been very resilient. And probably most importantly, what we're encouraged about is the continued strong momentum, not only in non-small cell lung cancer, we still are seeing in the U.S. first about 80% of the eligible patients receiving Keytruda. But we're also very excited about all the other indications that Roger mentioned and we're seeing really good growth in head and neck, bladder, adjuvant melanoma and some of the other newer indications. So all in all, we feel very confident in Keytruda not only in the near term, but as we've continued to stay long-term with regards to vaccines, you heard from Rob's comments up front is that April and May wellness visits were down very significantly in particular in the U.S. market, approximately 70% in the month of April. They started to improve as you got to June. And we really saw some encouraging pick with wellness visits for our pediatric portfolio and for the pediatric patient population. Adolescents are lagging a little bit behind, which is why we mentioned we're keeping an eye on GARDASIL, but we are seeing encouraging signs there with wellness visits, picking up as well, which gives us the confidence, not only near term for GARDASIL, but as we mentioned, the strong demand that we continue to believe will come through for GARDASIL, not only in the U.S. but clearly outside the U.S. in markets, such as China, so very confident in that outlook as well Chris.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you Chris. I\u2019ll turn to Ken for closing comments.\nKen Frazier: Thanks Peter. As you\u2019ve heard today, we remain confident in our strategy, our execution and our prospects for strong long-term growth. We remain committed also to bringing Merck's mission alive by advocating for innovative approaches and partnerships that will be essential to bring an end to this pandemic, while also investing behind our promising pipeline. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much presenters. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Ken Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning. And thank you all for joining today's call. I want to start by thanking all employees around the world for demonstrating resiliency and diligence through this difficult time. As a result of their tireless work, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities and we exited the quarter with accelerating business momentum. While the pandemic has brought challenges that few of us could have imagined, even six months ago, it has also demonstrated the critical importance of organizations that are focused on breakthrough science. Our scientists are highly focused on this effort and we are incredibly energized by this mission. Simply put, this is why Merck exists. Throughout the quarter, Merck executed well, both operationally in support of our existing portfolio and by advancing our innovative research program. We continue to perform at a very high level, without significant disruption to the production, supply and distribution of our medicines, vaccines and animal health products, or our clinical trial. As expected social distancing measures in many regions negatively impacted second quarter volume for many of us product. However, customer access to care is steadily improving, including in our portfolio of vaccines, which was hit particularly hard this quarter. We remain confident that our innovative portfolio will drive strong, long-term growth.  Our financial strength also allows us to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including continuing to invest in internal R&D and business development. In addition to advancing our strategic priority, we also achieved significant progress on our plans, spin off Organon & Co., which remains on track be completed in the first half of 2021. We remain confident that creating two more focused companies will result in each being stronger and better positioned in an evolving healthcare landscape, which will benefit the patients we serve and our shareholders. We recently announced the appointment of several talented and experienced leaders from outside the company to the strong leadership team. And they are already deeply engaged in driving the various work streams underway to set up the standalone company for success.  Before Roger provides more detail, I'd like to say a few words on the multiple efforts underway within Merck on the COVID-19 front. COVID-19 represents a tremendous challenge to the biopharmaceutical research community. And Merck is moving with urgency to apply our deep expertise in vaccines and infectious diseases towards potential solutions. During the quarter, we announced two vaccine development efforts, one through a collaboration with IAVI and the other through a now completed acquisition of Themis. We selected these candidates because they are based on proven platforms that we anticipate will lead safe, effective and broadly deployable vaccine with the promise of single dosage. Both vaccine candidates will soon enter the clinic, and we have begun investing to facilitate our ability to manufacture hundreds of millions of doses. We also announced a program to develop a novel, orally available, antiviral candidate through a collaboration with Ridgeback Bio. This compound has advanced into Phase 2 clinical trial. We are optimistic about the prospects with these three programs and if successful, Merck is committed to working with others to create broad, affordable, and equitable global access. These programs illustrate our continued commitment to supplementing internal capabilities with innovative external science project. Roger will provide more details on the significant progress being made in our research activities elsewhere. More broadly, the biopharmaceutical industry's response to COVID-19 has been extraordinary. Our industry is uniquely positioned to address this public health challenge on a global scale. Collaboration across the scientific, public health and biopharmaceutical industry community will be key to success and to help ensure that we are adequately prepared for the next. We are confident that science will ultimately prevail over COVID-19 with new medicines and vaccines. Let me conclude by expressing our gratitude to the frontline healthcare workers, as well as to our own employees, who have worked to help patients affected by COVID-19. Their dedication inspires us and makes us even more resolute in our commitment to bring forward new tools to help end this pandemic. The value of our industry to society is underscored by this crisis as is the need for companies like Merck, continue to invest in research and development to address the greatest health threat both now and in the future. And with that, I'll pass it over to my colleague, Rob Davis, to review the details of our performance and our outlook. So, I'll start off with the business development question, Louise. Thanks for the question. As Rob said, this business development remains a really important priority for us now and going forward. Right now, I think the environment which we are in is still a tough one in the sense that as you look at the first half of the year, the Biotech IPO market has outpaced last year, despite all the challenges associated with COVID, despite all the concerns that might happen with respect to the election. And of course, established biotech has also performed very well this year. So I think the challenge for us is to find the best scientific capability in a way that's value-creating for our shareholders. And right now, I think seller expectations are very high, notwithstand the issues around the political landscape, the executive orders and everything else. So I think at the end of the day, we still have to continue to search for the best clients commensurate with the need to create value for our shareholders. And I don't think the election is a critical factor there. Thank you. Next question, please, Lauer. And we're going to fix [indiscernible], to try to get as many questions in as possible. Thank you. Take you chance Roger. Thank you, Seamus. Next question, please, Laura. Roger? Thank you, Daina. We're going to take one more question and apologies to those of you that we didn't get to today. Frank? Thanks Peter. As you've heard today, we remain confident in our strategy, our execution and our prospects for strong long-term growth. We remain committed also to bringing Merck's mission alive by advocating for innovative approaches and partnerships that will be essential to bring an end to this pandemic, while also investing behind our promising pipeline. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And I hope that you and your family stay safe and healthy."

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. During the second quarter, we were able to expand laboratory operations beyond the essential production of materials for clinical trials, such that we are now once again selecting new chemical entities in discovery research and advancing these materials in preclinical testing. As our laboratories reopen, our priorities remains first ensuring the safety of our employees; and second, ensuring the patients in our clinical trials receive their treatments and are managed appropriately; and finally, we are once again applying our skills to identify new medicines and vaccines. Many programs that I highlighted in my remarks during our first quarter earnings call made substantial progress. For example, in May we received FDA approval for Lynparza developed in collaboration with our colleagues at AstraZeneca, when used in combination with bevacizumab for the first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who sustained a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and whose tumors demonstrate deficiency in homologous recombination based on results from an FDA approved diagnostic test. This approval referenced a biomarker subgroup analysis of the Phase 3 PAOLA-1 trial in which Lynparza plus bevacizumab improved median progression-free survival by more than two fold to 37.2 months. Lynparza also received FDA approval in May for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and also contain deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic homologous recombination repair gene mutations. This approval was based on results of our Phase 3 PROfound study. We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of men with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer have tumors containing these kinds of mutations. Later in the quarter, Lynparza gained a positive opinion from the CHMP for use in the first-line maintenance treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, whose tumors contain germline BRCA mutations, based on the POLO study. This recommendation was ratified by the European commission early in July. KEYTRUDA was the subject of numerous important regulatory actions in the second quarter, such that the FDA label is now nearly 100 pages in length and tabulate nearly 30 explicit approvals. I will not enumerate all of the regulatory activity associated with KEYTRUDA filings today, but we'll note that the second quarter began with the approval by the FDA of an extended dosing interval, 400 milligrams every six weeks for all adult indications. Though previously registered in Europe approval of this new dosing schedule in the United States offers positions and options to reduce the number of clinic visits that patients must attend to at a time when they have implemented important social distancing measures. In June, the FDA granted three additional approvals for KEYTRUDA. First, for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma that cannot be cured by surgery or radiation therapy. Second, for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer in patients whose tumors show evidence of mismatch repair deficient or MSI-high. And third, for the second line treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors whose tumors have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory treatment options provided that the tumors show a high mutational burden of at least 10 mutations per megabase of DNA. I wish to note here that this is the second tumor agnostic indication for KEYTRUDA. We received the very first such indication in the history of oncology therapeutics in 2017 with the accelerated approval of our MSI-high indication for KEYTRUDA in adults with solid tumors. As I just mentioned, this approach was extended still further in June with the approval for first-line treatment of MSI-high colorectal cancer, based on our KEYNOTE-177 trial. FDA approval for the second line treatment of patients whose tumors show a high tumor mutational burden represents the second time that KEYTRUDA has received an indication based on the molecular characteristics of the tumors themselves rather than the cell or organ from which these tumors are believed to have originated Two other FDA approvals from the second quarter deserves special mention. GARDASIL 9 was approved for the prevention of Human Papillomavirus related oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers. This was an accelerated approval, based on the effectiveness of GARDASIL 9 in preventing Papillomavirus-related anogenital disease and was supported by studies showing clearance of persistent oropharyngeal HPV infection index needs. A recent analysis by the U.S. centers for disease control, demonstrated that HPV attributable oropharyngeal cancer has now surpassed cervical cancer as the most prevalent form of HPV related cancer in the United States, approval in the head and neck cancer setting was the result of decades of investigation pursued by Merck Research Laboratories. We also received FDA approval for RECARBRIO for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible organisms. As COVID-19 hospitalizations increased the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia becomes more profound. RECARBRIO provides an important new antibiotic that can be especially helpful in treating infections due to pseudomonas species. Beyond these regulatory approvals, we continue to support \u2013 to submit important new files. For example, during the second quarter we filed the results of the VICTORIA study conducted in partnership with Bayer, which demonstrated that vericiguat, our novel orally administered soluble guanylate cyclase activator reduced the risk of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization when added to standard therapy in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure following a worsening event. These data were previously presented at the American College of cardiology meetings in the spring. The FDA has granted priority review to this application, reflecting the significant unmet need for new therapies in the heart failure population. In the oncology area, we also submitted for review our data from the KEYNOTE-355 and KEYNOTE-522 studies, which document the activity of KEYTRUDA in triple negative breast cancer either as second line treatment in combination with chemotherapy that in KEYNOTE-355 or as an adjunct to surgery in the neoadjuvant setting in combination with chemotherapy followed by monotherapy, KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting, that is the KEYNOTE-522 study. We announced yesterday, the acceptance of both files for review by the FDA, and here was well the KEYNOTE-355 file was granted priority review. This week we also announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough designation to MK-6482, our Novel HIF-2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease associated renal cell carcinoma based on data that we presented at the American society for clinical oncology meetings in June. Finally, our broad portfolio of activities in cardiovascular medicine, oncology and in infectious diseases now includes three new programs directed at interdicting the COVID-19 pandemic. As you are aware, during the second quarter we've forged a partnership with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop MK-4482 in nucleoside analog that disrupts the faithful replication of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. MK-4482 has now been studied in ascending dose protocol and has been shown to be well tolerated during five-day oral administration achieving drug levels that we would expect would be more than sufficient to block viral replication. The compound is currently under study in three different Phase 2 programs in outpatients, as well as in inpatients here in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Based partially on the results of these studies, we expect to initiate two large pivotal trials, one in outpatients and the second in hospitalized COVID-19 patients beginning in September. We are also in discussions with the active consortium to begin a large Phase 2 outpatient study conducted under the supervision of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. MK-4482 has demonstrated a strong barrier to resistance when studied in vitro, which was to be expected based on its mechanism of action. It is for example, active against viruses that have acquired mutations, rendering them resistant to remdesivir. In light of the profound medical need for an orally active treatment to reduce the impact of COVID-19, we have mounted a very aggressive clinical program as I described. And we have secured manufacturing capability to produce many millions of doses of the drug before the end of this year. At the same time, we're answering two important new vaccines directed against SARS-CoV-2. These vaccine approaches were selected for three reasons as Ken mentioned. First, they make use of proven vaccine platforms that have been used in human studies demonstrating both efficacy and safety. Second, they are replicating viral-vaccines, which means that they provide a very potent immune stimulus that could offer the promise of single dose administration. In dealing with an aggressive globally dispersed disease like COVID-19, we believe that it is wise to lower the barrier to vaccination as much as possible. For example by launching a vaccine that is effective with just a single administration. Third, since we believe that there may well be a need for different vaccines in different populations, we chose two well-characterized vaccine platforms that have quite different properties. A measles virus recombinant that was invented by the Institut Pasteur in Paris, and which we acquired through the purchase of Themis Bioscience and a vesicular stomatitis virus recombinant first developed by Health Canada, which we're advancing in partnership with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, IAVI. As this construct utilizes the same virus platform that we employed to develop our successful Ebola virus vaccine, which was registered in the United States earlier this year. In preclinical studies, both of these COVID-19 vaccine constructs have now been shown to stimulate neutralizing antibody production following a single intramuscular administration. Our program using the measles virus vaccine platform, which we call V591 has not completed clinical manufacturing. And we plan to begin clinical studies performed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur later this quarter. Meanwhile, we've been manufacturing clinical doses of the VSV-based COVID-19 vaccine, which we call V590 in our facilities in Pennsylvania. We also expect to begin clinical studies with V590 in the next few months. Planning for large global clinical trials involving both V590 and V591 is now nearly complete. These trials will initiate as soon as we have supportive data regarding immunogenicity. Finally, I note that one additional advantage of V590 is that it may be active when administered orally via a swish and swallow protocol. And again, this will help to lower the barrier to vaccination should it be affective. It should be playing that Merck Research Laboratories continues to advance development of new drugs and vaccines across many fronts. In this context, I wish specifically to commend the dedication of more than 10,000 MRL employees around the globe whose supererogatory efforts have again brought us hope that the world can gain greater freedom from greivous illness. Reviewing the progress that we have made in developing MK-4482 and both of our COVID-19 vaccines, I am optimistic that we will be able to reduce the impact of this devastating pendant. And now I'll turn the call back to Peter. Yes. Andrew, thank you for the questions. I think that in some sense, questions are related, if I caught them correctly, and I apologize the fact that I'm remote. And so the connection is perhaps not as clear as I would like it to be. But with respect to the expansion of clinical trials for a whole variety of new agents, we're seeing some interesting activity. Some of these data we'll, we hope, be able to present at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meetings, which are coming up in September. And we'll have additional opportunities we hope through towards the end of the year to talk about these data. And these data go precisely to the issue that you raised with non-small cell lung cancer. Now first, I should mention that, as you know, we have an extremely strong data set in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA is very active in that setting and active in combination with chemotherapy as we've shown. And that remains a hugely important intervention, the dominant intervention in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, either as monotherapy in the PD-L1 high population or in combination therapy. That said, you're also looking at activity of these new agents directed at a whole variety of different checkpoints in multiple cellular components as well as looking at the issue of mismatch repair deficiency in combination with KEYTRUDA. We're optimistic that we will begin to segregate non-small cell lung cancer patients still further on the basis of the fundamental properties of the tumors, and this goes precisely to our efforts in both MSI-high and tumor mutational burden in order to achieve still better results in the non-small cell lung cancer setting. So suffice it to say, we're extremely active in this area and generating a lot of very interesting data and hope to have a chance to present it to you very soon. Yes. Thank you, Umer. The \u2013 so, first of all, with respect to the COVID vaccine data, we have to say that from our starting position, knowing very little about SARS-CoV-2 to at the beginning. The results that we've seen thus far from a variety of early studies, Phase I studies, are as good as one could hope for, really. There was no guarantee that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 would prove to be as immunogenic as it is. So immune response, broadly speaking, across the population of vaccinees are quite good. The question you asked is, is there enough neutralizing antibody and how well we have to perform clinically. And unfortunately, we can't really know that until we look at Phase III studies. But I guess I would say first that, as has been discussed by others, most of the vaccines look as if they are going to be require a boost in order to produce high titer neutralizing activity against the spike protein. That seems clear. We don't know for sure, and maybe things will go better, which we can all hope for. With time, we'll see more of that. The second question, of course, is the production of immune response against the spike protein sufficient by itself? Or is it necessary to generate responses against other components of the virus, particularly the nuclear protein? And then, of course, there is the question of what contribution is made by T cell immunity. And a little bit that goes to the question of what we're actually trying to achieve. Finally, in the background is the question of whether the immune stimulation that we are producing could, in fact, contribute to adverse effects since it is widely believed that the severe pulmonary complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection include an overexuberant immune response that results in tissue destruction. So those are all open questions that can only be answered by large Phase 3 studies that extend for a considerable period of time. Those studies at least have begun now in a couple of cases. More will begin soon. And we'll have a chance to see exactly how these vaccines perform. I don't think at the moment, we can handicap it except to say that it is certainly a favorable finding that the spike protein in its various different forms, typically as a prefusion form or it's hoped it is a prefusion form, seems to be quite immunogenic, and there are reasonable titers of antibodies being produced. So that should give us considerable optimism. I should also say, I \u2013 we \u2013 the broader industry is collaborating and thinking about these problems in how to make sufficient doses available. And I think the community at large should be very encouraged by the enormous numbers of vaccine doses that are being planned for, for manufacturing, particularly as we get into 2021 and beyond. If these vaccines are effective, I think the industry is going to be able to produce enough material, ultimately, to provide vaccination for a substantial fraction of the world's population. Right. So the second question is, would we see an antiviral benefit with MK-4482? It's important to note here that MK-4482 differs in mechanism quite a lot from Remdesivir. Remdesivir, of course, is a RNA-dependent polymerase inhibitor. It caused determination. Whereas MK-4482 is a cytosine analog that is incorporated, and as a result, causes misincorporation of bases into the nascent RNA. Those RNAs are produced, but they contain many, many errors, and the result is something called aero catastrophe, which is a very powerful means of preventing production of functional virus. So those are two quite different mechanisms. The expectation is that there would be production of virus at least for a period of time, but that virus would not be able to replicate. I think from, from a variety of in-vitro studies, it is possible to measure a dramatic reduction in virus production. And we may see the same thing in our clinical studies. We are, of course, looking for it. The Phase 2 studies are underway. So it won't take too long until we have a chance to see that. We are, of course, as well measuring clinical outcomes. Right. For MK-4482, I think that the we \u2013 I don't really want to dribble out data on this. As we acquire meaningful data from the Phase II program, well, of course, let you know. But I should point out that we will be embarking probably in September on very large pivotal studies. And so those are going to be the important ones. And here, the goal has to be that with this orally active drug, that we can both reduce the duration of symptoms, but more importantly, key people who are symptomatic from becoming sick enough that they require hospitalization or if hospitalized, that they require intensive care unit hospitalization. The good news about MK-4482 is that it \u2013 because it is an oral drug given in capsules, it can be easily administered from the time that people have symptoms. And so that, I think, could mean that we could have a meaningful effect on the clinical outcomes. And that, of course, has to be the goal of therapy. Well, thank you, David. First of all, from the MK-4482 as you know that the compound is aims positive, that's in a way not unexpected given its mechanism of action, it is a cytosine analog. So that one could expect to see those kinds of things. The question is does the compound have mutagenic activities that's meaningful in mammalian cells and what we want to do about this. Ordinarily, of course, we don't want to take mutagens forward into clinical practice, although it has been done where the benefit risk profile makes sense. With respect to this compound, we should note that in other tests, for example, the in vitro and in vivo micronucleus test that the compound is negative. We're doing other in vivo tests for mutagenesis in mammalian systems. And we'll do the usual kinds of preclinical evaluations that are conducted in such settings which includes a development on reproductive toxicology studies and of course accelerated carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Those are the things that one customarily does and my expectation is that when you look at the totality of data, that benefit risk profile for a short term course in treating an acute pulmonary infection will be favorable. And of course, that has been seen before. So it is something that we pay a lot of attention to. But on the other hand, I think, something that we can overcome. With respect to MRNA vaccines you're right we have quite a bit of experience, which we gained from working with our colleagues at Moderna, in looking at MRA vaccination. And I think there are some great strengths to MRA vaccination in particular, it's quite fast as both Moderna and Beyontec now working with Pfizer had demonstrated one can move very quickly from knowing the sequence, the genetic sequence of a potential target to developing an immunogen. On the other hand, our concern from the beginning was that this was going to be a pandemic. We felt that way long before WHO declared it a pandemic. We had no idea it would be as severe and as widely dispersed as it has proved to be, it is a threat to the entire world. And none of us are safe until we're all safe, as everyone says. And with that in mind, the need will be to mount effective vaccination for a large fraction of human population. There are several aspects of that that are important to emphasize. The first of course, as I've said, is it is nice to have a single dose vaccine. It would also be nice to have a vaccine that could be administered orally in the way that, for example, not that this is directly relevant the same in oral vaccine and came to replace the original polio vaccine. And in addition, we should recognize that there are many different populations who are infected. Of course, everyone is ultimately infected, but we have an elderly population at extremely high risk, particularly those who have underlying cardiovascular disease. And those individuals, the elderly population, tend not to respond as well. So under those circumstances [indiscernible], and especially in potent immunogen that was a reason for wanting to choose a replicating viral platform, in addition to our desire to have a single dose. We also have children, and adolescents and those in their third decade of life who are currently being infected in very high numbers. And we have a lot of people in robust, early adulthood who are ending up in the intensive care unit. Those people have extremely potent immune responses, but that's important to get neutralization amounted quite early, I believe, in that population. So that could be a different kind of virus, maybe not the same one you would use in the adult population, as a vaccine, a different kind of viral vaccine. And the answer to the question of which one of these should we pay attention to, I think, I'm paying attention to both. We will get information from the measles platform earlier. And of course the measles platform, the measles vaccine has been used successfully in billions of people. So we have a lot of confidence in the way that will behave. We just need to see immunogenicity data. I would say, pre-clinically, it looks terrific. And then of course, we have a lot of confidence in the USP platform, which we've investigated extensively through the course of our registration program for Ebola virus vaccine. So I've watched them both. And I think that they're potentially quite important. Yes, Seamus thanks for the questions. For MK-4482, you're right, you're completely right, because of its mechanism-of-action, that it resembles a nucleoside base. It's in fact, just a derivatized version of a cytosine. It can be incorporated into any nascent RNA strain that is made by an appropriate virus. It's just a function of how well the viral polymerase is willing to accept the modified base. And just as one expects a virus is built for speed, typically viruses their RNA polymerases for RNA viruses are more accommodating of different structures than our mammalian DNA-dependent RNA polymerases involved in making messenger RNA, for example. And so it has good selectivity and good properties in that regard and should work very well for a whole variety of RNA viruses in vitro, it does exactly that. So a whole set of RNA viruses could potentially be treated, including, broadly speaking coronaviruses that we haven't yet made the acquaintance of. We don't really want to make the acquaintance of these, but our expectation is that this is not our last pandemic and probably not the last pandemic caused by coronavirus. So MK-4482 has broad activity and is potentially useful in a variety of different settings. Let's first see how it does with respect to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding islatravir, we have \u2013 of course, we remain enormously enthusiastic about islatravir Phase 3 studies are ongoing for the first set of combinations for islatravir for treatment of HIV infected individuals. And we've also, as you say, been looking for compounds to partner with islatravir, and we have such compounds. One of them moving forward right now is MK-8507. And we also have a group of others. So we believe that we're in a good place with respect to those. But we're moving forward in a variety of different directions. And then with respect to pre-exposure prophylaxis, yes, because the long durability of islatravir, the potential for a once monthly oral in particular, which could be used anywhere in the world, I think, is extremely attractive. But beyond that, as we've shown, islatravir can be formulated in a implantable form, which is a polymer that is positioned underneath the skin and can be active for potentially a year. And that provides, just about as close to perfect chemoprophylaxis as one can get, it's nearly vaccine like. So we're pursuing that as well, and we're optimistic about the ability of islatravir to make a big change in terms of the prevalence of HIV-mediated disease and the incidence of HIV infection. Yes, thanks for those questions. So we have a lot of confidence in the single dose activity of both vaccines, because these are replicating vaccines. So they replicate in you, they are very potent immunogens and they have single dose activity, single administration activity in other settings. So of course, with V590, that's the vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine. That has been demonstrated for Ebola virus disease very effectively. A single dose provides in the field in the setting of civil strife of a large magnitude, greater than 97.5% efficacy in a single dose. Now, I can't tell you that that's exactly that it will behave when we put a different gene in this case SARS-CoV-2 spike protein spike protein encoding nucleic acids into the construct. But the interesting thing about the VSV platform is that this is actually a vaccine in which the spike protein becomes part of the vaccine, the replication of the virus is completely dependent upon the spike protein, it becomes the envelope protein that the vaccine which is different from simply expressing the protein, wherever one expresses it. So that has big effects. And pre-clinically the magnitude of the response on single administration is very impressive. Similarly, the measles platform has been shown in a variety of different settings most recently with respect to the chikungunya administration to be a very potent immunogen. We have a lot of competence in that. And with respect to Y2, as I've said, there is reason to believe that multiple different vaccines will be required in order to manage this extraordinary global pandemic. In particular, when one thinks about the heterogeneity of the population that we want to vaccinate, those with extremely robust immune responses, for example, teenagers or those in their 20s, those in the elderly population at greatest risk, but we have poor immune responses just to give a couple of examples. There is also reason in terms of just the ability to deliver the vaccine to different parts of the globe and to administer it successfully as part of a huge global vaccination program. And so our intention at the moment is not to choose, but to instead examine the special properties of each of these very good platforms and then to see which one needs to be taken forward first and in which population and which perhaps second, although both could be advanced simultaneous."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken and good morning, everyone. As Ken highlighted, our business performed well in an unprecedented environment, while we saw a meaningful impact in the COVID pandemic in the quarter, particularly in April and May overall the business went well. Within our human health business, the impact is largely expected while within animal health, the impact was less than anticipated. That said we were able to deliver better than expected results in both human health and animal health due to our underlying operational strength combined with our execution in the face of the pandemic. Based on our ability to drive improved and accelerating operational momentum, we now expect to see stronger performance in the second half of the year. As a point of reference, if we adjust for the impact of COVID in the quarter, Merck's underlying sales growth would have been 6% nominally and 9% excluding exchange, reflecting strong demand for key growth pillars. We continue to operate from a position of financial and operational strength, which allowed us to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Investments behind our extensive pipeline of research programs remained robust and we also successfully completed two collaborations and an acquisition to bring in-house promising vaccines and antiviral candidates to address the COVID-19 pandemic as Ken referenced. All of this is in support of or goal of advancing science to fulfill unmet medical needs, the core of Merck's mission. Now turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $10.9 billion, a decrease of 8% year-over-year or 5% excluding the negative impact in foreign currency. The pandemic negatively impacted our second quarter results by $1.6 billion, reflecting approximately $1.5 billion in human health and approximately a $100 million in animal health. In the human health business, the impact to sales was spread to varying degrees across our vaccines, hospitals, women's health and oncology products due to access limitations from social distancing orders and prioritization of coronavirus patients and hospitals. Within the animal health segment, livestock product sales were impacted by a change in protein demand through the restaurant closures and regional outbreaks, while companion animal product sales reflected decreased visits to veterinarian offices. It's worth noting that despite the short term headwinds experienced in the quarter, the underlying strength and demand for our products enabled first half growth of 4% excluding exchange. The remainder of my comments will focus on the underlying performance of our key growth drivers and near term trends and will be on an exchange basis. Our human health revenues declined 6%. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 31% year-over-year, reaching $3.4 billion in the quarter. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA demonstrated strong growth across all key tumor types. We continue to strengthen our leadership in IO, including in lung in the face of recent competitor launches. We benefited from continued strength in melanoma, bladder, and head and neck cancers and strong momentum from launches in renal cell and in the matriarchal carcinomas. We received FDA approval for a six-week dosing regimen across all adult indications, which enabled greater patient access and contributed to growth. Outside the U.S., lung cancer indications, remains a driver of KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with reimbursement secured across all major markets. In Japan, the combined impact of delay in new patient starts, reduced frequency of existing patients and a huge seller price adjustments from February and April, more than offset volume growth in new indications. We saw COVID-related impact to KEYTRUDA in April and May across all tumor types, but not to the degree we expected. We were encouraged by the recoveries we saw in June, particularly in the United States and Europe. And this trend has continued in the third quarter. Strong growth in Lynparza and selumetinib continue to bolster our oncology performance as both products experienced limited pandemic impacts this performance in the quarter continues to reflect growth in leadership and the PARP class in the United States and the recent launches of the PAOLA-1 in ovarian cancer and PROfound in prostate cancer, provide opportunities for future growth. Lenvima maintains market leadership in first line hepatocellular carcinoma, and the combination with KEYTRUDA and endometrial carcinoma, is now the leading treatment regimen in the second line setting in the United States. Turning now to vaccines, our vaccines portfolio was negatively impacted by a reduction of patient visits to physicians offices in line with our expectations. GARDASIL sales declined 24% year-over-year, driven by stay-at-home workers in the United States and most of European markets, partially offset by continued demand driven core strength in China. In the United States, we were encouraged to see significant increase in wellness visits beginning in late April for children and in late June for adults, and anticipate this trend will lead to a recovery in our vaccines business in the back half of the year. Our hospital business was impacted by delays and cancellations of elective surgeries and prioritization of coronavirus patients in hospitals. This impacted sales of BRIDION, which declined 18% year-over-year. Reduced wholesale or inventories also contributed to the decline. We remain confident in the underlying demand for BRIDION and are encouraged by the ongoing recovery in overall surgical procedure volumes. Partially offsetting the decline in our hospital portfolio was the growth in provames. Animal health revenue increased 3% this quarter to $1.1 billion. Livestock grew 3% due to contributions from an acquisition in our animal health intelligence product line. And companion animal also grew 3%, reflecting strong growth at the productive line of products. Visits to veterinarian offices were negatively impacted early in the quarter, but offices opened earlier than expected, which benefited volumes. Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 73.8% in the quarter, a decrease of 160, driven largely by catch up amortization for expected milestone achievements for our collaborations on Lynparza and selumetinib. Operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. In total, COVID resulted in reduced spending of approximately $325 million, driven largely by lower promotional, selling and administrative costs along with lower laboratory, travel and meeting expenses.  The significant year-over-year increase in other income was driven by unrealized equity gains from our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investments in Moderna and MGM.  The tax rate for the quarter of 15% was driven by lower full year effective tax rate as a result of favorable earnings mix. Taking together, we earned $1.37 cents per share, an increase of 9% excluding exchange. Now, turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As expected April was a particularly challenging month in the human health business. As we moved through May and particularly through June, however, we saw a meaningful increase in patient wellness business to providers and in elective surgeries of hospitals. And our oncology business was particularly resilient due to the strength and breadth of our offerings.  Business conditions have clearly improved and despite increased outbreaks and infection rates that are impacting the phasing of our recovery, we believe the healthcare system is better positioned to provide patient access as we move through the balance of the year. The improved underlying operational strength we are seeing across several parts of our portfolio will help to more than offset the impact from COVID-19 and lead to stronger expected second half growth. In addition, when we were benefiting from our prior investments in digital capabilities to interact with our patients, providers and payors, allowing us to continue to address medical inquiries and promote our products effectively. This gives us further confidence in our ability to drive efficiencies in our business as we adapt to a post-COVID world through our continuing digital and other transformation efforts. On the Animal Health side, as mentioned, veterinarian offices opened earlier than initially expected, which benefits our companion animal products and stay at home restrictions lifted sooner than anticipated, which positively impacts our livestock products. These favorable trends contributed to our better than expected second quarter results and favorably impacted our outlook to the full year. We will continue to monitor regional outbreaks, restaurant and school openings and any potential impacts to for our demand livestock products. Now turning to guidance, our updated guidance reflects continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business, a more limited COVID impact and previously expected [indiscernible] business as a whole and a more favorable FX environment. Our assumptions regarding the progression of the COVID impact remain unchanged. We assume that the largest impact from COVID occurred in the second quarter, which recovery haven't begun during the second quarter that will continue through the third quarter, before return to normal operating levels in the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues of $47.2 billion to $48.7 billion, which reflects an increase of $850 million from our previous midpoint. Our guidance now seems roughly $1.95 billion of COVID headwind for the year. This is a reduction from our prior assumption of $2.1 billion, which human health roughly in line with and animal health below our prior estimates. We now assume a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 2 percentage points using mid-July rates. Overall, our guidance implies 3% to 6% growth in revenue for the full-year, excluding the impact of exchange, reflecting strong underlying demand for our products. The one area we are watching is vaccines and GARDASIL in particular for a potential extended recovery timeline. However, this risk has been fully considered within our guidance range and more than offset by the overall strength we expect to see across the rest of our portfolio. We continue to expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are now expected to be roughly flat year-over-year, reflecting increased R&D spend offset by reduced SG&A cost. The increase in our OpEx assumptions versus previous guidance reflect spending in R&D associated with the acceleration of our COVID-19 programs. This guidance still implies operating margin expansion of approximately 100 basis points for the year. We now expect a full year tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% reflecting improved earnings mix. We now expect other income of roughly $550 million before I can hire unrealized gains in our equity securities portfolio based on June 30th valuations. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taking together we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.63 to $5.78 which reflects an increase of $0.44 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a negative impact in foreign exchange of roughly 3 percentage points. Our results are benefiting from an improved tax rate and higher other income due to gains from our equity holdings. Excluding these benefits, however, we continue to drive operational leverage in the P&L. Revenue growth coupled with continued expense management, while we invest in R&D including our COVID-19 candidates and capacity expansion is expected to drive operating margin expansion to the full year. Our cash flow generation and access to capital both are strong, and we remain well positioned to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including full investment behind our key growth drivers and pipeline. Continued commitment to the dividend and strategic value enhancement business development to enhance our pipeline and long-term growth potential. To conclude, we remained competent in the fundamentals of the business and the meaningful growth opportunities that lie ahead, despite the near-term impact from the pandemic. A favorable recovery trend that we saw through the quarter positions our company for accelerating business momentum as we head into the back half of the year. The underlying health of the business and demand for innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines remains strong. This combined with our strong clinical execution across the portfolio and our expanding indications, which Roger will highlight in a moment continues to reinforce our confidence and the sustainability and strength of our revenue growth. During these challenging times, we are leveraging our operational and financial strength, not only to weather the storm, but also to execute meaningfully on our strategy of innovation and our mission to bring new medicines to patients. We continue to believe this best positions Merck for a success and value creation long into the future. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. Yes. Good morning. So, as you pointed out, we did stop this share repurchase after the first quarter, and all we did that really out of an abundance of caution because we weren't sure how do you would progress. I'm happy to report, and as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our cash flow actually remains very strong. And our access to capital is also very strong. I think we demonstrated that in a recent debt offering at record low rates. So from that position, we're in a good position. As we think about share repurchase for the remainder of the year, we continue to evaluate it. Business development is very important to us. So I obviously put a priority on making sure we have the capital necessary for business development to fund the business itself and the meaningful capital expansion were underway as well as all of the important programs that we've talked about. So we're looking at all of that and continuing to evaluate whether or not we will restart in the remainder of the year."

            "content": "Yes, Chris good morning. For Keytruda, we are very encouraged, especially over the last month. We are seeing new patient starts get back to where they were almost pre-COVID. If you look at what happened in the quarter, Chris, April and May new patient starts were down somewhere in the range about 5% to 10%, depending on the cancer type, but that has improved. And we're seeing that pretty much around the world where oncologists are now figuring out ways to be able to get patients into their practices. That's going to vary by geographies. There will be some ups and downs around that, but all in all oncology has been very resilient. And probably most importantly, what we're encouraged about is the continued strong momentum, not only in non-small cell lung cancer, we still are seeing in the U.S. first about 80% of the eligible patients receiving Keytruda. But we're also very excited about all the other indications that Roger mentioned and we're seeing really good growth in head and neck, bladder, adjuvant melanoma and some of the other newer indications. So all in all, we feel very confident in Keytruda not only in the near term, but as we've continued to stay long-term with regards to vaccines, you heard from Rob's comments up front is that April and May wellness visits were down very significantly in particular in the U.S. market, approximately 70% in the month of April. They started to improve as you got to June. And we really saw some encouraging pick with wellness visits for our pediatric portfolio and for the pediatric patient population. Adolescents are lagging a little bit behind, which is why we mentioned we're keeping an eye on GARDASIL, but we are seeing encouraging signs there with wellness visits, picking up as well, which gives us the confidence, not only near term for GARDASIL, but as we mentioned, the strong demand that we continue to believe will come through for GARDASIL, not only in the U.S. but clearly outside the U.S. in markets, such as China, so very confident in that outlook as well Chris."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken. \nKen Frazier : Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. In this challenging and unprecedented time, our first quarter performance reflects strong demand for our portfolio of innovative products, continued commercial and clinical execution and the dedication and resilience of our employees around the world. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. The COVID-19 global pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to all of us including serious threats to the health of people, businesses, and economies around the world.  Without question, our industry and our company have a unique ability and responsibility to help the world respond to this global pandemic by working collaboratively to deliver solutions to coronavirus infection, while also maintaining the supply of medically important products to those who need them.  Amidst this crisis, we at Merck are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, while also ensuring that our essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach the patients we serve. Importantly, the majority of Merck's manufacturing plants and clinical supply sites remain fully operational. And we have seen little impact to the production, supply, or distribution of our medicines, vaccines, and Animal Health products.  In many markets around the world, including the U.S., while our offices and laboratories remain open, our colleagues are primarily working from home. And for patients currently enrolled in our clinical trials, we're making every effort to ensure that patients in affected areas are able to continue their treatment and receive appropriate care and monitoring. Conditions are fluid and evolving. But as conditions allow, we are enrolling patients in ongoing studies, and we're starting new studies.  Of course, there is great interest in what we're doing to address COVID-19 from a scientific perspective. Roger Perlmutter will speak to the totality of our efforts in more detail. But I will mention that we have deep scientific experience and expertise in both antivirals and vaccines. And our research colleagues are actively engaged in efforts to combat COVID-19. We have teams of scientists researching COVID-19 itself, and assessing antiviral and vaccine candidates for their potential to impact the disease.  In addition, we've been working extensively with the broader scientific community to assess different assays and have been engaging with a range of research organizations on collaborative efforts. We know from our experience with viral epidemics like HIV and Ebola, that scientific collaborations are essential to develop medicines and vaccines in a global public health emergency like the one we are facing now.  We also know that the path to a new medicine or vaccine is rarely short, nor that easy. But we are optimistic that our industry's efforts will create new tools to combat this coronavirus. And Merck is committed to playing its part in response to this global pandemic for the patients that depend on our medicines and vaccines, the global community and those directly impacted by COVID-19. The underlying demand for our innovative portfolio of products remains strong and our business remains fundamentally sound. However, the pandemic is impacting patients\u2019 ability to access hospitals and physician offices, particularly for many of our products, which require physician administration. And social distancing measures are also impacting customer access and demand for our Animal Health products.  Rob and Frank will speak to the near-term impacts to our business in a minute. But on a longer term basis, we remain confident in our outlook for strong growth once people adjust and find ways to address the needs of health and healthcare beyond COVID-19. Importantly, our financial strength and strong balance sheet allow us to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including investing in R&D and in our growth drivers, investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, paying our dividends, and continuing our search for value enhancing business development, which remains a top priority. We also remain fully committed to a spin-off transaction, and we believe we are on track for completion in the first half of 2021. We completed several important milestones in the quarter including the naming of the new company Organon & Co. Inc, a name which has strong brand equity and engenders trust among healthcare professionals for its dedication and innovation in Women's Health. We've also named several members of the Organon leadership team. We continue to believe that two more focused companies will allow us to reach more patients, drive stronger growth, and unlock longer term value for shareholders.  To conclude, we recognize now more than ever the importance of our investment in R&D, and the value of our science-based approach. We remain dedicated to our mission to save and improve lives through the discovery of innovative new medicines and vaccines to treat and protect patients in the midst of the pandemic and in the future.  With that, I'll now pass it over to Rob Davis to review the details of our performance and outlook.\nRob Davis : Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken stated, while we are operating in a challenging time, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong underlying fundamentals of our business, as well as successful planning and execution that is allowing us to maintain continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to the patients we serve. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects, driven by the strong underlying demand for our products. So we are now seeing the COVID-19 will impact our near-term results, due mostly to patient access challenges.  In this environment, our strong financial position and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to maintain strong liquidity and very healthy access to the capital markets and our capital allocation priorities remain largely uninterrupted.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year or 13% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed to the growth this quarter. COVID-19 had an immaterial impact on our business in the first quarter with both pushes and pulls across our divisions and regions. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis.  Our Human Health revenues grew 12% led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales increased 46% year-over-year, reaching $3.3 billion. In the United States growth was driven by all key tumor types. And we continue to strengthen our overall leadership position in the I/O market, including across indications for lung, bladder and head and neck cancers. Our launches in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial and first-line head and neck cancers continue to feel momentum. And we are excited about the prospects for our application for a six week dosing regimen across all indications, which is currently under review by the FDA.  Outside the United States, lung cancer indications continue to drive KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU, growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with secured reimbursement across all major markets, and we are encouraged by early uptake in the adjuvant melanoma, head and neck and renal cell carcinoma launches.  In Japan, KEYTRUDA showed growth driven by new launches and continued strength in lung, despite the implementation of the huge seller price adjustment in February. Our oncology portfolio continues to benefit from both our products in Lynparza and Lenvima, with Lenvima continuing to lead PARP class in the United States with over 60% share, while Lenvima maintains market leadership in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma and benefits from the launch in combination with KEYTRUDA and in endometrial carcinoma.  Turning now to vaccines. GARDASIL growth reflects continued positive underlying demand globally as well as the timing of shipments in China, which contributed roughly $120 million in growth to the quarter, and the timing of public sector purchases in the U.S., which benefited revenue by approximately $70 million. PNEUMOVAX also contributed to growth this quarter, in part due to increased demand related to heightened interest in pneumococcal vaccination, given the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and Europe.  Our hospital business benefited from growth in BRIDION recycling strong performance across all major regions and in PREVYMIS reflecting demand and the benefit of launches globally.  Animal Health revenue increased 21% this quarter to $1.2 billion. Livestock grew 24% largely due to the contribution of the Antelliq acquisition and COVID-19 related buy-in. Companion Animal grew 17% driven by demand for BRAVECTO as well as the COVID-19 related buy-in.  Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $4.4 billion were roughly flat year-over-year. SG&A spend decreased 7% driven by lower promotion and selling costs due in part to COVID-19, while R&D spend increased 10% reflecting higher clinical development and research costs, as well as higher licensing costs.  In total, our operating expenses were favorably impacted by $100 million in reduced spending due to COVID-19, largely driven by lower promotional and selling costs, and delayed spending on our clinical trials.  The year-over-year increase in other expense was driven by higher net interest expense due to reduced cash balances, partially offset by net gains on our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investment in Moderna. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Taken together, we earned $1.50 per share, an increase of 26% excluding exchange.  In summary, the underlying demand for our products in the first quarter, even after adjusting for timing and COVID-19 impacts, delivered very strong growth and demonstrates the continued underlying strength and operational momentum in our business. As we move through the year and eventually put the impact of COVID-19 behind us, this demand will be the foundation upon which we expect to deliver strong and sustained growth into the future. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we head into the second quarter, we are seeing decreased patient visits, due to reduced access to hospitals, and other healthcare providers, as well as social distancing recommendations.  I'd like to pass the call to Frank to provide additional color on the dynamics we are seeing. \nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ken and Rob, the impact to our business from the ongoing pandemic is largely driven by a reduction in healthcare provider and patient interactions, as hospitals redirect resources toward COVID-19 and patients avoid healthcare facility visits, and postpone preventive care. To better understand the impact to Merck, it is important to highlight that our portfolio is heavily weighted towards products administered by a physician. In fact, roughly two-thirds of our global Human Health revenue is comprised of physician administered products.  Taking this a level deeper, we've seen updated guidelines and recommendations from the CDC and various professional associations, further enforced social distancing measures via delays in wellness visits and the postponement of treatment. For example, based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC, most pediatricians have pushed out the routine immunization of all children, except for those under 24 months in the United States. And in the United States physician office visits across various areas of medicine are currently running down in the neighborhoods of 70% versus pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result of these measures, we are seeing impacts to our vaccine portfolio, including the GARDASIL, PNEUMOVAX and our pediatric vaccines and to our Women's Health products in both our fertility medicines, as well as IMPLANON/NEXPLANON of physician administered implantable. Non-urgent elective procedures have also been postponed or cancelled in most major markets in order to slow the spread of disease and enable hospital prioritization of COVID-19 patients. Many sources are reporting current declines in elective procedures of over 70% with urgent procedure volumes also being affected, though to a much lesser degree. These declines impact a product like BRIDION, which is used across many surgery settings. And even oncologists are delaying appointments and procedures as they prioritize patients based on severity and the immediate needs of different tumor types, resulting in extended dosing schedules for existing patients, as well as delays in the start of therapy for newly diagnosed patients.  As Rob will outline in a minute, however, based on our overall assumption with respect to the timeline for return to a more normal environment, as well as our experience in China, a market which was impacted earlier by the pandemic, but which is now recovering, we expect to be most heavily impacted in the second quarter.  Most importantly, we believe the underlying demand for our portfolio of products remains strong based on the substantial medical benefits they bring to patients. As the peak of the pandemic passes, we believe providers and patients will move quickly to find ways to safely provide and seek treatment. And as a more normal environment for patient access is reestablished, we believe our portfolio will be -- will again be well positioned to achieve strong long-term growth.  With that, I will turn it back to Rob. \nRob Davis: Thanks, Ken. Now turning to guidance. We expect decreased volumes due to the reduced access and social distancing impacts that Frank described, particularly in the second quarter, which we assume is the peak of the virus in the United States and Europe. We expect to begin to see this dynamic subside as hospitals begin to normalize through the third quarter and as social distancing measures begin to lift across geographies at which point we would expect a phased return to more normal levels of volumes, unencumbered by access concerns.  While we do expect to progress to normal pre-COVID-19 volumes by the beginning of the fourth quarter, a large portion of the impact in Q2 will carry to the full year. In Animal Health, we expect to experience a more protracted recovery timeline, given decreased demand for milk and protein due to the shutdown of restaurants and schools, reduced visits to veterinarians and the impact of reduced employment and incomes. Of course, our actual results could vary based on how the disease progresses, and how various countries respond. We now expect revenues of $46.1 billion to $48.1 billion, which reflects a decrease of $2.5 billion from our previous midpoint. This difference is comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of negative impact due to COVID-19 on an ex-exchange basis, made up of approximately $1.7 billion from Human Health and $400 million in Animal Health. We also now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly $750 million, or 2.5 percentage points using mid-April rates.  Finally, Human Health operational strength of roughly $300 million partially offsets the negative COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. We now expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are expected to decline at a low-single-digit rate driven by lower SG&A. Our updated assumption anticipates lower promotional and selling expenses and clinical trial costs. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We continue to expect other expense of roughly $200 million. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Given the current environment and out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase activity, which will help ensure that we preserve our strong financial position to pursue our capital allocation priorities of investment in the business and ongoing business development. Taking together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.17 to $5.37, which reflects a decrease of $0.43 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a roughly 3.5 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency equating to an approximately $0.11 FX headwind versus our prior assumptions. Importantly, the company's financial strength and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to execute our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged despite the currently challenging environment. As of the end of the quarter, we held $8 billion in cash and marketable securities and retained good access to the commercial paper markets.  In addition, our cash collections continue as expected, with no significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic impact to-date. As a reminder, our first priority is to invest in our existing R&D programs, as well as to support new programs aimed at COVID-19. This pandemic underscores our commitment to R&D now more than ever. We will continue to invest in manufacturing capacity expansion, and we remain firmly committed to the payment of our dividend.  In addition, as Ken noted, business development remains a priority, and we will continue to look for the best external sources of science to augment our pipeline. We will assess the environment on an ongoing basis and consider reactivating the repurchase program as warranted. In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand we see for our innovative portfolio and the underlying fundamental strength in our business. While the pandemic will impact us in the short-term, we're well positioned financially to weather this storm and continue the investments we're making across our business to drive growth and importantly to bring additional innovations to the patients we serve. We also remain confident in the underlying demand of our products based on their competitive position and the benefits that they provide and fully expect to see our growth return once patient access normalizes. As a result, our expectations are unchanged regarding our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We believe all of this continues to be a source of significant and sustainable long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger.\nRoger Perlmutter: Thanks, Rob. I will divide my commentary on our first quarter results into three parts. First, I will describe the current operational status of Merck Research Laboratories, focusing in particular on clinical research and our interactions with regulatory agencies. Second, I will highlight some of the important results that we achieved during the first quarter and will outline some of what we hope to achieve as the year progresses. Finally, I will comment specifically on the actions that we hope and what we have taken to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.  So let me begin with our operational status. As an early point, our global clinical operations team recognized the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 infections that were reported in Wuhan, China, and made advanced preparations to manage what became the COVID-19 pandemic. These preparations included prepositioning clinical supplies, strengthening our clinical supplies network, putting in place processes to enable virtual monitoring and over time developing processes for home deliveries, investigational agents, including in some cases, developing alternative infusion sites. Operating virtually the clinical operations team, including data management and our quality organization has been able to maintain our overall clinical trial schedule. We have in some cases reduced enrollment in certain jurisdictions. But we have not halted enrollment and are continuing to launch new clinical trials across most jurisdictions.  As examples, our team processed 36 database logs in the month of March, and enrolled more than 700 new patients across our Europe, Middle East, Africa sites. These numbers provide substantial reassurance that our clinical programs are moving forward. Indeed, although I cannot predict what the course of the pandemic will be in the future, for now, our 2020 MRL objectives are not in jeopardy. This progress is owed entirely to the extraordinary work of teams across our organizations spanning five continents, and a very broad set of government regulatory agencies with whom we interact.  Turning now to important research accomplishments. As noted previously, the first quarter began with FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, our 23rd KEYTRUDA indication and we continue to generate important data related to the ability of KEYTRUDA to improve cancer therapy.  An interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 studies demonstrated that KEYTRUDA in combination with standard chemotherapy improved progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10. This result complements the data from our KEYNOTE-522 study in which a combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy provided as neoadjuvant treatment versus chemotherapy alone improves the pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing surgery for triple-negative breast cancer. We expect to describe these results in detail at an upcoming medical meeting.  We also announced the results of our KEYNOTE-204 study which demonstrated that KEYTRUDA monotherapy improved progression-free survival in adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, as compared with brentuximab vedotin. These data strongly support our current indication in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. And the study will continue to permit evaluation of the dual primary overall survival endpoint. Also during the quarter, we announced the results of our KEYNOTE-177 trial, a Phase 3 study in which monotherapy with KEYTRUDA improved progression-free survival, as compared to standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer, whose tumors had demonstrated deficiency in mismatch DNA repair or evidence of DNA microsatellite instability, the so called MSI high phenotype. The study will continue as is customary to permit evaluation of an overall survival endpoint once the data are mature.  Most will recall that in 2017 we gained the very first approval of a tumor agnostic PD-1 directed therapy indication with the identification completed in collaboration with colleagues at Johns Hopkins University of MSI high status as a biomarker for tumor responsiveness. At the end of the first quarter, we also received priority review from the FDA for what we regard as a second potential tumor agnostic indication, the use of KEYTRUDA in certain patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden that is greater than equal to 10 mutations per megabase of DNA, irrespective of tumor type.  We look forward to presenting all of these data at upcoming scientific meetings and in peer reviewed journals. As I've indicated, we are also engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding these data. Finally, we announced last week that based on discussions with the FDA, we have responded to their prior Complete Response Letter and have resubmitted our application for approval of the use of KEYTRUDA in a 400 milligram every six weeks dosage form across all indications in adults, based both upon modeling information and new data that have emerged from our KEYNOTE-555 study, which will be discussed in part at the American Association for Cancer Research Meeting later today.  We've also seen important progress in our partnership with AstraZeneca of Lynparza our leading PARP inhibitor. Just last week, we announced new results from a key secondary endpoint of our PROfound trial, which shows statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2 genes or the ATM gene, all of which are important for homologous recombination related DNA repair, following treatment of Lynparza as compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide therapy.  The result provides yet another example of the benefit of Lynparza therapy in patients whose tumors have defined DNA repair mutations. I\u2019ll remind you that we presented primary data from the PROfound studies at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting in October of 2019. We expect the details of the PROfound study, though not those just announced, will be published in the top tier medical journal in the very near future, perhaps this week.  I should also note with respect to Lynparza that our PAOLA-1 study, a Phase 3 trial examining the combination of Lynparza plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in the first-line maintenance treatment of women with advanced overall -- ovarian cancer is under review by the FDA for the PDUFA date in the second quarter.  I cannot complete our survey of important results in tumor therapy without mentioning the approval two weeks ago of Koselugo known generically as selumetinib which is the first selected therapy approved for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who are suffering from symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromis. The approval of Koselugo is part of our longstanding collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca, who first identified this important next signal transduction inhibitor.  Beyond oncology, we also advanced important programs in other therapeutic areas. Earlier in the quarter, we had the opportunity to present the results of our Phase 3 VICTORIA study performed in collaboration with colleagues at Bayer which demonstrated that vericiguat, an investigational soluble guanylate cyclase agonist provided benefit as judged by composite endpoints including heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death as compared with placebo, when given as add on therapy to well treated patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who had suffered a worsening event. This represents the first study of its kind in the population at very high risk for further cardiac complications. The data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented virtually at The American College of Cardiology Meeting just last month.  Also during the quarter we announced that in our Phase 3 program, gefapixant, our investigational P2X3 antagonist reduced the 24 hour cough frequency in patients with longstanding chronic cough. Details of these results will also be published and presented in the not too distant future.  Finally, in the metabolic disease area, we have just announced results for the Phase 3 VERTIS CV cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this study conducted jointly by Merck and Pfizer, compared administration of STEGLATRO an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 or SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic vascular disease, and achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events. These events were defined as time to the first event of CV death non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.  The key secondary endpoints of superiority for STEGLATRO versus placebo for time to the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure, CV death alone and the composite of renal death, dialysis/transplant or doubling of serum creatinine from baseline were not met. While not a pre-specified hypothesis for statistical testing, a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was observed with STEGLATRO. The safety profile of STEGLATRO was consistent with that reported in previous studies. Detailed results of VERTIS CV are scheduled to be presented on June 16th at the virtual American Diabetes Association\u2019s 80th Scientific Session.  I will now describe activities during the past quarter directed at developing treatments that could have an impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a leading vaccine manufacturer for more than 100 years, it is no surprise that we have embarked upon a broad-based development program for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Let me put these results in the proper context. Vaccine development is extraordinarily difficult and customarily requires many years of investigation. As others have noted during the past quarter century, despite enormous efforts, there have been only seven vaccines directed against previously unaddressed human pathogens that earned registration. Four of these seven were developed by Merck Research Laboratories. And so we have relevant experience in this area.  ERVEBO, our most recent vaccine, which has been demonstrated to provide protection from -- with the Zaire strain of Ebola virus, was developed rapidly and under emergency use authorization to help address outbreaks in West Africa. Nevertheless, there required a multiyear development program and involved building a factory that we're proud to say can produce 1 million doses of vaccine per year. The development and registration of ERVEBO required the efforts of hundreds of our employees as well as an extraordinary commitment from the World Health Organization and then from healthcare workers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and many other jurisdictions. With the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we are tasked with creating a completely new vaccine in 1/10th the time that we devoted to ERVEBO, and we must plan to manufacturer this vaccine at 1,000 times the scale. We approached this challenge with enthusiasm but also with humility. We know from long experience that creating safe and effective vaccines typically requires decades of efforts and investment. We're mindful of the imperative to act with speed indeed with urgency. Based on the progress that we have made, I will say that I am optimistic that a vaccine capable of inducing a potent neutralizing immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can be invented. But it's also critical to develop a comprehensive understanding of this particular coronavirus which will allow us to design, develop and ultimately to manufacture vaccine that can be deployed globally.  With this in mind, we have first supported efforts to characterize effective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. As we announced yesterday, we have partnered with scientists at the Institute for Systems Biology, Swedish hospital, and the Providence health system, all in Seattle, with Stanford University and numerous others to collect cells in sera over multiple time points from patients diagnosed with COVID-19.  Data derived from these analyses will be made available to researchers worldwide, and will position us to cipher correlates of immunity to this coronavirus. With respect to the vaccines themselves, we have been thoughtful in selecting proven platforms that we\u2019ve used to generate vaccines with desirable qualities in the past. Of course, in light of my prior comments regarding the difficulty of developing successful vaccines, I cannot guarantee to you that any of these approaches will prove effective in the near-term.  However, you should have no doubt that scientists in our own laboratories and those of our collaborators are committed to this process. We've also worked to identify internal resources that can support the manufacture of these potential new vaccines at an appropriate scale. And we are in discussions with contract manufacturers who could assist in what would surely rank as the most challenging vaccine production initiative ever undertaken.  Beyond our search for vaccines, we are also engaged in studying potential antiviral drugs that could be deployed more rapidly. Here too we have evaluated compounds in our own laboratories, and have identified programs at other laboratories that could prove beneficial. Time does not permit me to describe these programs in detail. Instead, I would like to mention that the global community of biopharmaceutical companies has been very open to collaboration to address this challenge.  Within MRL, we are trying to help as many of our colleagues as we possibly can, both through the active consortium led by the National Institutes of Health and also through interactions with many companies large and small, that have contacted us for advice and assistance with their own programs.  I will close by emphasizing that at Merck our mission is to translate breakthrough research into medicines and vaccines that improve and extend life. This mission has never seemed more vital than it does today. I wish to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues here at Merck for working tirelessly in pursuit of a means to ameliorate the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll now return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Roger. Jerome, while you line up the queue, I just want to remind everybody. Our front comments went a bit longer than normal today. We're prepared to go past 09:00 o'clock. But we do ask that you limit yourself to one or two questions so we can get as many questioners in as possible. So, thank you. Jerome, if you can line up the queue, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two for me. Just wondering, I know you commented a little bit on this. But in terms of the environment, and your approach to capital allocation, I know you've called out no further share repurchases. So can you just give us any more detail, the main driver there, is that you see an increasing number of M&A or BD opportunities now in this environment?  And the second, I was just wondering with respect to the pharma guidance, specifically, the new guidance. Can you give us any more detail on the pacing of the impact? I'm assuming the majority of that's going to occur in the second quarter. And then can you break that down by product meaning how much was KEYTRUDA versus GARDASIL versus other? Thank you.\nRob Davis: With regard to maybe the second question first, the pharma guidance is, the majority of that will hit in the second quarter and the majority of it is in the United States. And maybe I'll turn it over to Frank to give you some of the more specifics on product detail before coming back to the first question. \nFrank Clyburn : Yes. So, in the second quarter, we do anticipate vaccines, in particular. It's important to note that we have a very broad vaccine portfolio that ranges from infants, all the way to older adults. And we do anticipate that based on well visits being down approximately 70% that, that will impact our vaccine portfolio. Also in the hospital specialty area, BRIDION, as I mentioned, elective surgeries are down approximately 70%. So we do see an impact there. It's important to note, we have a significant product IMPLANON/NEXPLANON, which requires physician administration. We think there'll be an impact during the second quarter. And then as far as oncology goes, overall, we believe that oncology is pretty resilient.  We are seeing new patient visits decline by approximately 10% to 20%, depending on the indication, and we think that will have a slight impact in the quarter from a new patient perspective, but feel very confident as we move into the third and fourth quarter for not only oncology, but for the rest of our portfolio. Rob?\nRob Davis: Thank you, Frank. And then on your question about share repurchase program, just to be clear, and I had it in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reinforcing. We really decided to temporarily stop the share repurchase program predominantly out of an abundance of caution. Our financial position continues to be strong. And as we said, it really was to make sure that we can continue to do all of the investments we want to do in R&D and CapEx to support our future growth, and in business development, as you asked. So it's really across all those areas that we want to make sure we can prioritize investment. And we will continue to look at it and very well could reinstate the share repurchase as we see the situation evolve in the marketplace.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you. Next question?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.\nChris Schott: Just to follow up on the vaccine commentary, can you just talk a little bit more about how you see that business normalizing. This sounds like clearly the 2Q trends are going to be depressed. So should we think about a catch up in 3Q and 4Q as wellness visits return or is it just more like normalized volumes, and we shouldn't expect as much of a catch up I guess, specifically on that line?  The second question which is a bigger picture question about we're clearly seeing high unemployment rates, and what more broadly does that mean for Merck's business? Should we be thinking about lower price and adverse payer mix as representing a headwind to your business as we look beyond some of these near term COVID disruptions, or is that a manageable kind of dynamic as we think about the longer term business? Thank you very much. \nFrank Clyburn: Hi, Chris, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. I'll take your second question first on payer mix and impact. And I'll give some color into our mix in the U.S. It breaks out approximately, Chris, the commercial business represents about a third of our business from a mix perspective. We have about 17% of our mix, it\u2019s important to note, is in vaccine private pay because of the significant size of our vaccine portfolio as we've been discussing. Government represents about half of our overall payer mix. But also important to note, half of that or approximately 26%, 27% is KEYTRUDA related because of Medicare Part B. So we've talked about, as KEYTRUDA continues to grow we anticipate that will grow over time.  Medicaid Part -- or Medicare, I should say, Part D is a small percent, approximately 7%. And then we have very small percentage of our business in Medicaid. And then the rest is pretty much other with regards to federal and some other parts of our payer mix. But if you look at our portfolio, Medicaid is very small. We're clearly looking at unemployment rates, and we'll have to monitor that as it goes forward. I think it's too early to assume anything at this point in time. However, we have taken into our guidance different scenarios as we possibly will see increased unemployment. But for us, in particular, Medicaid is a small portion of our business.  Shifting to vaccines, just to give you a little bit more insight, we expect as you come into -- or towards the end of the second quarter, into the third quarter, we expect that the infants and young children who have missed their vaccines during COVID-19 will be prioritized first. We then expect that we'll see the adult pneumococcal vaccines come back strongly as we head into the flu season. And then we expect adolescents and young adults will probably come back a little bit slower, Chris, as patients are able to engage with the healthcare systems.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line if Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may now ask your question. \nTim Anderson: Yes, thank you. So I'm sure it does not go unnoticed by you that Merck so far is the only company to lower guidance, but we're maybe only halfway through. We saw companies reporting. And I'm just really trying to tease out what else beyond product mix could be driving that. Is that you guys running your supply chain narrower or you're less able to kind of manage business from a work-from-home environment. Could it be that you\u2019re possibly more conservative, for example, you're pausing share buybacks. In Merck, I think there's been a pretty strong cash position. You have slowdown in brands, but I would think also you have slowdown in spending that you could find as an offset kind of again mirroring what other companies are seeming to be able to pull off in their guidance. So, I don't know if there's anything else that you can add beyond what you said, but it just strikes me as odd.  Second question, is on KEYTRUDA and a big industry overhang is data from Roche, a good oncology company, it's randomized Phase 2, its first-line lung that\u2019s coming up here at ASCO most likely, and we know they're pushing into Phase 3. And so I'm wondering, how is this not going to be a continual variable for American investors? As part of that, if you can just update us on your own TIGIT program which I know is earlier. \nKen Frazier: I think we'll start with Rob and then turn it over to Roger for TIGIT. \nRob Davis: Thanks, Tim, for your question. So if you look at why we lowered guidance, and understand, again, the profile of our business, and I think it's really important that we just really hit this home, it is the fact that we are seeing reduced access is what's driving the reduction in guidance. Because of the fact as Frank said two-thirds of our products are physician administered and that is probably somewhat unique and is causing the impact. And as we said, while we expect to get back to normal by the time we get to the fourth quarter, because we're going to see a large impact mainly in the second quarter, a little bit in the third, that second quarter impact largely carries to the year and it's really what's driving it. The other thing to point out is our Human Health reduction is only a little over half of what's driving the reduction in our guidance. It's actually almost half of it is coming from foreign currency, and the fact that we have the impact in Animal Health. And if you look at it, the impact in Animal Health is actually more significant than it is in the Human Health business. So that is also a little bit of a differentiation relative to some of our peers.  And if you look then at how does that translate down to the bottom-line, what you see is actually for the full year, we're actually bringing down OpEx more than what is the impact of just COVID-19 reductions in spend. Some of that is also due to the way currency is flowing through our operating expense line, but then there is a little bit of incremental savings we also were assuming. I would say we didn't go harder at OpEx primarily because we don't see this as a demand driven issue and we want to be in a position that as the market normalizes we can come back fully with our products. So we're expecting to continue to invest in research and development, R&D will continue to grow and we will continue to make selective investments to be prepared to come back strong, as we see the market normalize. And that's why we've not pulled down OpEx further. But you shouldn't read anything more into this than the mix of our business and the fact that the access is impacting our ability to deliver what we originally expected for the year. Roger on TIGIT?\nRoger Perlmutter: Right. Let me speak more generally to the combinations with KEYTRUDA. And it is the case that really since we began -- since I began working with the KEYTRUDA program back in 2013, we have been exploring a whole variety of different combinations with various agents and that's what led us of course to partner with AstraZeneca and Lynparza and partner with Eisai and Lenvima, and has led us to develop a whole set of programs internally that we are using in combination with KEYTRUDA in various clinical studies, including TIGIT, and numerous other biologicals that are well advanced in our program. I've indicated before that we have really quite impressive data in some of these combinations. Most importantly, of course, in our Lenvima combination where we have registration in endometrial cancer and have already presented data for the combination in renal cell carcinoma. But beyond that with the biologicals as well, we are looking for effects that are really meaningful and that will make a big difference from an efficacy standpoint, while preserving the very favorable profile that KEYTRUDA has already demonstrated. So we are making good progress. We're looking forward to developing some of these agents assuming that these play out. And of course, we'll be watching what others do. I think we're in a very good place. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho Securities. You may now ask your question.\nMara Goldstein : Just a little bit more on currency, if you don't mind. And I'm just curious as you think to how you made these adjustments for currency, can you possibly give us some more granularity on what is a contracted issue versus what is actually a country-by-country swing in currency? And then secondarily, can you just confirm the timing of the split off given everything that's going on from a COVID perspective?\nRob Davis: So on a currency basis, if you look at what is driving the reduction, it is entirely just due to change in where we see rates as of mid-April. So basically, we took the mid-April exchange rates and assumed those held for the full year. And as a result of the fact that what you're seeing is that really versus almost every currency, the dollar has strengthened as there has been a flight back to the dollar -- as soon -- as the quality currency and as a defensive measure, that is impacting us. It's hitting us across all of our currencies. But importantly, what's happening as well -- and we're not able to hedge as much as we normally would is because we're also seeing a material impact in the emerging market currencies as well, where we don't hedge today. So it's really that is what's driving entirely the $750 million reduction that we talked about in our guidance. And then on your second question on the timing of the spin out. As Ken noted in his prepared remarks, we continue to expect to have the spin out completed in the first half of 2021. That is consistent with where we guided last quarter. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Navin Jacob with UBS. You may now ask your question.\nNavin Jacob: Navin from UBS. Roger, a question for you on your COVID-19 vaccine program. It's just -- it was interesting that you mentioned or highlighted that you've chosen to go with proven platforms. Wondering your thoughts on some of the more novel platforms such as mRNA why perhaps you may or may not be looking at some of those more novel platforms? Sort of associated with that also, would love your thoughts on neutralizing antibodies as a method for either treatment or prophylactic treatment. And then a separate to that but along the same lines, wondering how you're thinking about whether mutations around the spike protein could create selective pressure and how you think about items such as that or whether it's antibodies defendant enhancements that may be putting some -- maybe affecting how you're thinking about proven platforms versus for novel platforms? Thank you very much. \nRoger Perlmutter: Right. Well, thanks. Thanks very much for the question. So first of all, we are interested in any and all approaches that could be helpful in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we've been in discussion with most all of the organizations that are trying to do this in various different ways, whether that's using passive immunization with antibodies or trying to use alternative methods of active immunization that are -- can more rapidly be brought into the clinic like nucleic acids, mRNA in particular. And of course, we have a long history of collaboration with people who have done that kind of work.  Our sense, though, is that -- the task before us is one that requires a vaccine that will be quite stimulatory and that will yield neutralizing antibodies ideally with a single immunization. Of course, it must first be safe because you're talking about a vaccine that would in principle be given to much of the world's population in order to protect the world's population. And since we believe that virtually everyone is susceptible, these are all high bars. And that makes us want to return to proven platforms that have these kinds of characteristics. And that's where we have put our focus. My expectation is that over time, we will need more than one vaccine in order to actually protect the human population from SARS-CoV-2. So that's sort of thing that we've looked at.  Specifically with respect to the neutralizing antibodies being administered as passive vaccination, we've looked at a number of those. In the near term that may turn out to be a useful approach for individuals who -- perhaps in the treatment context and also for individuals who are at extraordinarily high risk and have a great susceptibility because of age and comorbidities. But it's a broadly based method to protect the human population I think, probably less likely to be used just for logistical reasons. That doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing to work with others to help develop that if that proved to be the near term -- the most important thing that one could do.  Finally, I would say that just to put the cart back behind the horse, and the issue of selective pressure and mutation, we should recognize that while right now we're not seeing an enormous amount of variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when we put selective pressure on the virus either with an antiviral drug and some of those do indeed look fairly promising early on or with a vaccine it is possible that we will see variants emerge and those variants can prove to be important. And that's something else that we're paying quite a bit of attention to. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. \nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. I have two questions for Roger please. To follow on to your remarks regarding COVID, could you please comment on the potential to; one, inject disinfectants; and two, to use UV rays inside the body to cure COVID. No, I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. So on a more serious note, could you discuss Merck's novel I/O agent readouts to watch in 2020? And second, could you discuss your conviction in the profile of Merck's 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and your disclosure in adult filing plans? Thank you.\nRoger Perlmutter : Yes, David. So with respect to novel immuno-oncology agents, I mean I've mentioned some of this before in response to a prior question, but we have a stable of them. We're of course looking at our own CTLA-4 molecule, have been for some time in combination with KEYTRUDA. We are also looking at LAG-3, TIGIT and a whole variety of others. We have 20 or so agents that we have tested in the clinic and all of these are being tested versus monotherapy and thereafter as combination with KEYTRUDA. But I should emphasize that KEYTRUDA really is quite special. We've not seen anything of course that has characteristics that are like KEYTRUDA. If we did, that would be a very different story. And it's no surprise because we and many other investigators, university-based investigators, myself included, looked for these kinds of things for decades and never found anything that looked like KEYTRUDA. It's unlikely we're just going to kick one over now when we didn't have those in the past. That doesn't mean though that those things in combination with KEYTRUDA couldn't be beneficial and we're seeing some early signs that suggest that's possible and we'll have quite a lot more to say about that during the coming year. And the second question had to do with our conviction with respect to our 15-valent molecule V114 for invasive pneumococcal disease. We have a lot of conviction behind it. I think we've already reported our Phase 2 data that everyone has had a chance to see. The Phase 3 data will be available to us very, very soon. And as soon as those data become available, assuming the data Phase 3 recapitulate what we saw in Phase 2, which is certainly our hope and expectation, those -- the top-line of those data will be announced of course and we'll at that point provide more clarity with respect to our filing plans. But our expectation would be that filing could occur not long thereafter. So we're really very enthusiastic about this vaccine because of the important new serotypes in it and also the balance with respect to the immune response that we saw in our V114 studies in Phase 2.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. You may now ask your question.\nSteve Scala : I have two questions. As has been stated clearly Q1 beat but full-year guidance was lowered. We are now about a third of the way through Q2, in the month of April, which could be the peak of the pandemic. You must be seeing a major impact on oncology, vaccines, hospital and Animal Health. Is that a reasonable conjecture? And secondly, Roger, many investors were underwhelmed by the data on vericiguat and gefapixant. What in your view are investors missing? Thank you.\nKen Frazier : Alright, start with Frank.\nFrank Clyburn : So Steve, I'll start. So to answer your question, yes, Steve, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with regards to vaccines, we are seeing an impact due to the reduction in patients and well visits. We are seeing a reduction in our hospital specialty area in particular BRIDION with the reduction in elective surgeries as well as Women's Health. So we are seeing that in Q2, which is why we've updated our guidance and we also want to reiterate though we do see, as we are seeing in China, as we get through this period, we believe things will come back gradually in Q3. And then as we get into Q4, we'll return to normal operations. And I just want to continue to echo that we're very confident in the overall portfolio and in the demand trends that we see.\nRob Davis : And I would just add on the Animal Health front. It's a similar situation to Human Health. We are seeing the impact now in the quarter and we do expect that the second quarter will be the vast majority of the impact driving what is the full-year reduction. So it definitely will be most acute in the second quarter, but it will continue a little bit into the third and fourth and be a little bit more prolongated than what we expect from the Human Health business, driving a larger downside impact to our Animal Health business than it's having to our Human Health business.\nKen Frazier : Great, Roger?\nRoger Perlmutter : Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. So first of all on vericiguat and the VICTORIA study, so the VICTORIA study address a patient population that typically is excluded from most studies and these are patients who have had a recent de-compensation in their status. These are patients with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure, who have typically undergone heart failure hospitalization as a result of some deterioration. And hence, this is a very brittle population if you looked at the data that were published. But what you saw with it was that these patients were really quite ill and had indices of heart failure, of heart stress that were much, much higher than what is typically found in a heart failure population. So the reason why the paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the reason why it was -- there was a plenary presentation at the American College of Cardiology on these results is precisely because this is a very different population, the therapy is given as add-on to existing heart failure therapies and improves outcomes. And so, that's a pretty important result and I think there is a lot of enthusiasm for it within the cardiovascular community and amongst those physicians who treat heart failure. So I think that's really important to recognize. This is really a -- quite a change in terms of how we think about these patients and it's an important patient population to treat. And then with respect to the gefapixant, well of course, we haven't presented the gefapixant data. We'll have a chance to do that. I think everyone should recognize two things; the first is that chronic cough is an extremely common complaint in the general population. So physicians are often called upon to try and help people who are interrupted by chronic cough and in our Phase 3 studies we had some individuals who have had chronic cough complaints, continuous chronic cough complaints for more -- for decades. So this is a pretty significant interruption in their lives.  On the other hand, I don't want to dismiss the difficulty of going into a completely new area, because there are no -- there hasn't been no drug registered for chronic cough. There's been no study of this kind previously. It's a completely novel area. It will take some time for this to develop and for people to understand it.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. You may now ask your question.\nLouise Chen : So my first question is on the TMB-High opportunity here. What is that for Merck? And is there any off-label usage of KEYTRUDA in that population already, and if so, how much? And then second question is, if you could provide more color on your Taiho-Astex KRAS opportunity and when we can start to see data from that pipeline asset? Thank you.\nKen Frazier : First question on TMB-High. Roger, would you like to speak to TMB-High please and also the second question?\nRoger Perlmutter : Right, Okay. For TMB-High, so this -- the basis for seeking registration is a study done in a variety of different tumor types, the KEYNOTE-158 study in which their responses at the moment are currently inadequate. And so the goal was to look and see, well was there anything that we could do in these tumor types in which we could demonstrate that KEYTRUDA had an effect in certain patients, and we looked at a variety of different markers so that we could use. It turned out for us that a tumor mutational burden marker at greater than 10 mutations per megabase was associated with an improved overall response in certain of these tumors and that's what we've sought registration for and we are in the midst of having those discussions with the agency. So we'll see what happens. I frankly am not aware of off-label use and we wouldn't necessarily know anything about that in that population. And with regard to our KRAS program, it's actually quite a broad program looking at both GDP and GTP bound forms of KRAS and looking at the mutations beyond the cysteine mutation, codon 12 mutation, veiled cyst mutation which occurs in a fraction of patients, but there of course are many other mutations, aspartic acid substitution, valiant substitution et cetera. So we're looking quite broadly, but it will be a while before we have the opportunity to bring the first of those compounds into the clinic.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great, thank you. We have a number of questioners still in the queue. We're going to stop at 9:15, but we're going to keep going for now. Next question please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. You may now ask your question.\nAndrew Baum : So a question for Roger on TIGIT, you've clearly seen efficacy signals from your trial activity. Genentech has noted is seeing strong efficacy signals in a PD-L1 High. So is the central reason before accelerating any Phase 3 program, whether TIGIT is additive or synergistic the chemo in patients with low PD-L1 expressing tumors or is there some other hurdle which is holding you back? And on the same note, I mean how do you view the commercial risk/reward of taking further time optimizing the patient population at the expense of potentially disadvantaging yourself by giving Roche more lead time should that Phase 3 program in first-line non-small cell lung in combination with chemo pans out. That's first question. And the second question very quickly to Frank, you've discussed the fairly obvious impact of delayed presentation to healthcare providers for third party-administered pharmaceutical. Could you talk to how you think about in the U.S., the commercial impact associated with rising insurance rates associated with unemployment? I realize that you have far less exposure than some of your peers, but I'm interested in your thoughts generally, but obviously it does relate to things such as Diovan as well, which, tell you have commercial exposure. Thank you.\nKen Frazier : Great. Roger, first on TIGIT and then we'll turn it to Frank.\nRoger Perlmutter : Well Andrew, thank you -- thanks for the question. Again on TIGIT, different companies will have different perspectives on this. Our view really is still quite simple and it's not -- I wouldn't over think this. What we want to see is sufficient evidence of benefit in combination which is -- where you can unambiguously say that both elements, that is KEYTRUDA in our case and the anti-TIGIT antibody, both elements and that same is true for LAG-3 or CTLA-4 or any others are each contributing and so that there is at least additive effect and ideally better than that if one could get it. And so, we want to be absolutely sure of that and we want to be absolutely sure that we're addressing the right patient populations and of course we want to be sure that there is no deterioration in the favorable adverse experience profile of KEYTRUDA. So it's just a matter of reaching a conclusion about that. We could eventually reach the conclusion that you know we don't actually think it's good enough and there could be a whole variety of reasons for that or we could reach the conclusion, yes, we think this is really important, let's move forward. There are a number of programs in which we are sort of looking at that and we are going to find some data that's intriguing, but we just don't have enough data yet to make us feel comfortable about it. Other people might look at that data and say we need to go immediately. We are doing what we think is the right thing in that regard.\nKen Frazier : Great, Frank?\nFrank Clyburn : And Andrew, I think we're all concerned obviously what we're seeing in the U.S. with regards to rising unemployment. As I mentioned earlier, for us, we'll have to see the shift potentially from our commercial business over to higher discounted segments like Medicaid. But just to reiterate again, Medicaid is a very small portion of our business currently and as we look going forward, our business and payer mix is more geared toward Medicare and in particular, Part B Medicare.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. You may now ask your question.\nSeamus Fernandez : Great, thanks so much for the question. So, just a couple here. Could you guys comment -- I know we'd commented on the Medicaid side of things, but 340B expansion could be a meaningful threat to the industry overall. Just trying to get a better understanding of what Merck's 340B exposure is currently since that's a hospital-based program than then could shift to Medicaid-based pricing. So just love to get a better understanding of your thoughts there on exposure. And then, for Roger, can you just help us understand what's unique or special about Lenvima that has Merck pursuing such a broad effort where others with similar type TKIs certainly not, and I think this is where I'd love for you to comment on the differentiation have not pursued that. And I think this is particularly interesting in the context of the relatively limited patent life for Lenvima. Thank so much.\nKen Frazier : Frank, then Roger.\nFrank Clyburn : Yes, Seamus, so just -- if you look at 340B, the majority of the exposure really is for products like JANUVIA and also KEYTRUDA. For KEYTRUDA, approximately a third is within that 340B segment today. It has been growing slightly year-on-year and we'll have to see how, as I mentioned, things continue to unfold with regards to what's happening in the environment and it's obviously something that we're closely monitoring.\nKen Frazier : Great, Roger, on Lenvima?\nRoger Perlmutter : Right. So Seamus that the -- we're quite data driven on this. We were enthusiastic about Lenvima initially from the monotherapy data that our colleagues at Eisai had obtained and we thought there was a chance that that could prove to be a good combination with KEYTRUDA. We had -- we did some experiments like that with them and then we signed our agreement with them. And when we signed our agreement, we thought let's do a signal detection study looking across a broad set of tumors. And as we've done that, we've seen a lot of really quite interesting signals. Those of course weren't the only combinations with multi-kinase inhibitors that we tried, but we've seen impressive signals in combination with KEYTRUDA. And as you know, every multi-kinase inhibitor is different. Each one hits a different range of molecules and their effects are different. So it's quite hard to describe why that's true and whether that reflects VEGF receptor-antagonism in the context of FGF receptor or whatever. But what you can say is that they're all different and the results that we've obtained with Lenvima have been very promising. So we are quite enthusiastic, obviously, first of all in endometrial, in other tumors, the data we presented for renal and there are many others besides. So we're moving forward with that program.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you all for your questions and apologies to those we didn't get to.

            "name": "Ken Frazier",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning and thank you all for joining today's call. In this challenging and unprecedented time, our first quarter performance reflects strong demand for our portfolio of innovative products, continued commercial and clinical execution and the dedication and resilience of our employees around the world. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. The COVID-19 global pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to all of us including serious threats to the health of people, businesses, and economies around the world.  Without question, our industry and our company have a unique ability and responsibility to help the world respond to this global pandemic by working collaboratively to deliver solutions to coronavirus infection, while also maintaining the supply of medically important products to those who need them.  Amidst this crisis, we at Merck are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees and their families, while also ensuring that our essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach the patients we serve. Importantly, the majority of Merck's manufacturing plants and clinical supply sites remain fully operational. And we have seen little impact to the production, supply, or distribution of our medicines, vaccines, and Animal Health products.  In many markets around the world, including the U.S., while our offices and laboratories remain open, our colleagues are primarily working from home. And for patients currently enrolled in our clinical trials, we're making every effort to ensure that patients in affected areas are able to continue their treatment and receive appropriate care and monitoring. Conditions are fluid and evolving. But as conditions allow, we are enrolling patients in ongoing studies, and we're starting new studies.  Of course, there is great interest in what we're doing to address COVID-19 from a scientific perspective. Roger Perlmutter will speak to the totality of our efforts in more detail. But I will mention that we have deep scientific experience and expertise in both antivirals and vaccines. And our research colleagues are actively engaged in efforts to combat COVID-19. We have teams of scientists researching COVID-19 itself, and assessing antiviral and vaccine candidates for their potential to impact the disease.  In addition, we've been working extensively with the broader scientific community to assess different assays and have been engaging with a range of research organizations on collaborative efforts. We know from our experience with viral epidemics like HIV and Ebola, that scientific collaborations are essential to develop medicines and vaccines in a global public health emergency like the one we are facing now.  We also know that the path to a new medicine or vaccine is rarely short, nor that easy. But we are optimistic that our industry's efforts will create new tools to combat this coronavirus. And Merck is committed to playing its part in response to this global pandemic for the patients that depend on our medicines and vaccines, the global community and those directly impacted by COVID-19. The underlying demand for our innovative portfolio of products remains strong and our business remains fundamentally sound. However, the pandemic is impacting patients' ability to access hospitals and physician offices, particularly for many of our products, which require physician administration. And social distancing measures are also impacting customer access and demand for our Animal Health products.  Rob and Frank will speak to the near-term impacts to our business in a minute. But on a longer term basis, we remain confident in our outlook for strong growth once people adjust and find ways to address the needs of health and healthcare beyond COVID-19. Importantly, our financial strength and strong balance sheet allow us to continue with our capital allocation priorities, including investing in R&D and in our growth drivers, investing in manufacturing capacity expansion, paying our dividends, and continuing our search for value enhancing business development, which remains a top priority. We also remain fully committed to a spin-off transaction, and we believe we are on track for completion in the first half of 2021. We completed several important milestones in the quarter including the naming of the new company Organon & Co. Inc, a name which has strong brand equity and engenders trust among healthcare professionals for its dedication and innovation in Women's Health. We've also named several members of the Organon leadership team. We continue to believe that two more focused companies will allow us to reach more patients, drive stronger growth, and unlock longer term value for shareholders.  To conclude, we recognize now more than ever the importance of our investment in R&D, and the value of our science-based approach. We remain dedicated to our mission to save and improve lives through the discovery of innovative new medicines and vaccines to treat and protect patients in the midst of the pandemic and in the future.  With that, I'll now pass it over to Rob Davis to review the details of our performance and outlook. I think we'll start with Rob and then turn it over to Roger for TIGIT. Alright, start with Frank. Great, Roger? First question on TMB-High. Roger, would you like to speak to TMB-High please and also the second question? Great. Roger, first on TIGIT and then we'll turn it to Frank. Great, Frank? Frank, then Roger. Great, Roger, on Lenvima? Thank you everyone for joining us today. Our mission of save and improve lives will continue to drive the Company in the coming days and months in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Merck is committedly doing everything in its power to ensure our medicines and vaccines reach patients around the world and we expect to contribute to the global pandemic response efforts today and also to prepare for the next potential crisis. The underlying demand for our product remain strong and our fundamentals remain very sound. In the near-term, we -- I reiterate, our portfolio is different, and as a result, our near-term guidance takes into consideration what's really happening in the outside world in an attempt to be realistic about physicians and their ability to access patient. But in the final analysis, we believe that our underlying business fundamentals are very sound going forward and we look forward to providing updates on the business as we continue to navigate through these challenging times. And until then, we hope that you and your families, all safe and healthy. Thank you."

            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As you heard from Ken and Rob, the impact to our business from the ongoing pandemic is largely driven by a reduction in healthcare provider and patient interactions, as hospitals redirect resources toward COVID-19 and patients avoid healthcare facility visits, and postpone preventive care. To better understand the impact to Merck, it is important to highlight that our portfolio is heavily weighted towards products administered by a physician. In fact, roughly two-thirds of our global Human Health revenue is comprised of physician administered products.  Taking this a level deeper, we've seen updated guidelines and recommendations from the CDC and various professional associations, further enforced social distancing measures via delays in wellness visits and the postponement of treatment. For example, based on recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC, most pediatricians have pushed out the routine immunization of all children, except for those under 24 months in the United States. And in the United States physician office visits across various areas of medicine are currently running down in the neighborhoods of 70% versus pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result of these measures, we are seeing impacts to our vaccine portfolio, including the GARDASIL, PNEUMOVAX and our pediatric vaccines and to our Women's Health products in both our fertility medicines, as well as IMPLANON/NEXPLANON of physician administered implantable. Non-urgent elective procedures have also been postponed or cancelled in most major markets in order to slow the spread of disease and enable hospital prioritization of COVID-19 patients. Many sources are reporting current declines in elective procedures of over 70% with urgent procedure volumes also being affected, though to a much lesser degree. These declines impact a product like BRIDION, which is used across many surgery settings. And even oncologists are delaying appointments and procedures as they prioritize patients based on severity and the immediate needs of different tumor types, resulting in extended dosing schedules for existing patients, as well as delays in the start of therapy for newly diagnosed patients.  As Rob will outline in a minute, however, based on our overall assumption with respect to the timeline for return to a more normal environment, as well as our experience in China, a market which was impacted earlier by the pandemic, but which is now recovering, we expect to be most heavily impacted in the second quarter.  Most importantly, we believe the underlying demand for our portfolio of products remains strong based on the substantial medical benefits they bring to patients. As the peak of the pandemic passes, we believe providers and patients will move quickly to find ways to safely provide and seek treatment. And as a more normal environment for patient access is reestablished, we believe our portfolio will be -- will again be well positioned to achieve strong long-term growth.  With that, I will turn it back to Rob. Yes. So, in the second quarter, we do anticipate vaccines, in particular. It's important to note that we have a very broad vaccine portfolio that ranges from infants, all the way to older adults. And we do anticipate that based on well visits being down approximately 70% that, that will impact our vaccine portfolio. Also in the hospital specialty area, BRIDION, as I mentioned, elective surgeries are down approximately 70%. So we do see an impact there. It's important to note, we have a significant product IMPLANON/NEXPLANON, which requires physician administration. We think there'll be an impact during the second quarter. And then as far as oncology goes, overall, we believe that oncology is pretty resilient.  We are seeing new patient visits decline by approximately 10% to 20%, depending on the indication, and we think that will have a slight impact in the quarter from a new patient perspective, but feel very confident as we move into the third and fourth quarter for not only oncology, but for the rest of our portfolio. Rob? Hi, Chris, it's Frank. Thanks for the question. I'll take your second question first on payer mix and impact. And I'll give some color into our mix in the U.S. It breaks out approximately, Chris, the commercial business represents about a third of our business from a mix perspective. We have about 17% of our mix, it's important to note, is in vaccine private pay because of the significant size of our vaccine portfolio as we've been discussing. Government represents about half of our overall payer mix. But also important to note, half of that or approximately 26%, 27% is KEYTRUDA related because of Medicare Part B. So we've talked about, as KEYTRUDA continues to grow we anticipate that will grow over time.  Medicaid Part -- or Medicare, I should say, Part D is a small percent, approximately 7%. And then we have very small percentage of our business in Medicaid. And then the rest is pretty much other with regards to federal and some other parts of our payer mix. But if you look at our portfolio, Medicaid is very small. We're clearly looking at unemployment rates, and we'll have to monitor that as it goes forward. I think it's too early to assume anything at this point in time. However, we have taken into our guidance different scenarios as we possibly will see increased unemployment. But for us, in particular, Medicaid is a small portion of our business.  Shifting to vaccines, just to give you a little bit more insight, we expect as you come into -- or towards the end of the second quarter, into the third quarter, we expect that the infants and young children who have missed their vaccines during COVID-19 will be prioritized first. We then expect that we'll see the adult pneumococcal vaccines come back strongly as we head into the flu season. And then we expect adolescents and young adults will probably come back a little bit slower, Chris, as patients are able to engage with the healthcare systems. So Steve, I'll start. So to answer your question, yes, Steve, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with regards to vaccines, we are seeing an impact due to the reduction in patients and well visits. We are seeing a reduction in our hospital specialty area in particular BRIDION with the reduction in elective surgeries as well as Women's Health. So we are seeing that in Q2, which is why we've updated our guidance and we also want to reiterate though we do see, as we are seeing in China, as we get through this period, we believe things will come back gradually in Q3. And then as we get into Q4, we'll return to normal operations. And I just want to continue to echo that we're very confident in the overall portfolio and in the demand trends that we see. And Andrew, I think we're all concerned obviously what we're seeing in the U.S. with regards to rising unemployment. As I mentioned earlier, for us, we'll have to see the shift potentially from our commercial business over to higher discounted segments like Medicaid. But just to reiterate again, Medicaid is a very small portion of our business currently and as we look going forward, our business and payer mix is more geared toward Medicare and in particular, Part B Medicare. Yes, Seamus, so just -- if you look at 340B, the majority of the exposure really is for products like JANUVIA and also KEYTRUDA. For KEYTRUDA, approximately a third is within that 340B segment today. It has been growing slightly year-on-year and we'll have to see how, as I mentioned, things continue to unfold with regards to what's happening in the environment and it's obviously something that we're closely monitoring."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. As Ken stated, while we are operating in a challenging time, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong underlying fundamentals of our business, as well as successful planning and execution that is allowing us to maintain continuous supply of our medicines and vaccines to the patients we serve. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects, driven by the strong underlying demand for our products. So we are now seeing the COVID-19 will impact our near-term results, due mostly to patient access challenges.  In this environment, our strong financial position and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to maintain strong liquidity and very healthy access to the capital markets and our capital allocation priorities remain largely uninterrupted.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year or 13% excluding the negative impact from foreign currency. Both our Human Health and Animal Health businesses contributed to the growth this quarter. COVID-19 had an immaterial impact on our business in the first quarter with both pushes and pulls across our divisions and regions. The remainder of my comments pertaining to sales will be on an ex-exchange basis.  Our Human Health revenues grew 12% led by key products in our oncology, vaccines and hospital businesses. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales increased 46% year-over-year, reaching $3.3 billion. In the United States growth was driven by all key tumor types. And we continue to strengthen our overall leadership position in the I/O market, including across indications for lung, bladder and head and neck cancers. Our launches in renal cell carcinoma and endometrial and first-line head and neck cancers continue to feel momentum. And we are excited about the prospects for our application for a six week dosing regimen across all indications, which is currently under review by the FDA.  Outside the United States, lung cancer indications continue to drive KEYTRUDA growth. In the EU, growth continues to be driven by the uptake of KEYNOTE-189 with secured reimbursement across all major markets, and we are encouraged by early uptake in the adjuvant melanoma, head and neck and renal cell carcinoma launches.  In Japan, KEYTRUDA showed growth driven by new launches and continued strength in lung, despite the implementation of the huge seller price adjustment in February. Our oncology portfolio continues to benefit from both our products in Lynparza and Lenvima, with Lenvima continuing to lead PARP class in the United States with over 60% share, while Lenvima maintains market leadership in first-line hepatocellular carcinoma and benefits from the launch in combination with KEYTRUDA and in endometrial carcinoma.  Turning now to vaccines. GARDASIL growth reflects continued positive underlying demand globally as well as the timing of shipments in China, which contributed roughly $120 million in growth to the quarter, and the timing of public sector purchases in the U.S., which benefited revenue by approximately $70 million. PNEUMOVAX also contributed to growth this quarter, in part due to increased demand related to heightened interest in pneumococcal vaccination, given the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and Europe.  Our hospital business benefited from growth in BRIDION recycling strong performance across all major regions and in PREVYMIS reflecting demand and the benefit of launches globally.  Animal Health revenue increased 21% this quarter to $1.2 billion. Livestock grew 24% largely due to the contribution of the Antelliq acquisition and COVID-19 related buy-in. Companion Animal grew 17% driven by demand for BRAVECTO as well as the COVID-19 related buy-in.  Turning to the rest of our P&L, my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $4.4 billion were roughly flat year-over-year. SG&A spend decreased 7% driven by lower promotion and selling costs due in part to COVID-19, while R&D spend increased 10% reflecting higher clinical development and research costs, as well as higher licensing costs.  In total, our operating expenses were favorably impacted by $100 million in reduced spending due to COVID-19, largely driven by lower promotional and selling costs, and delayed spending on our clinical trials.  The year-over-year increase in other expense was driven by higher net interest expense due to reduced cash balances, partially offset by net gains on our security holdings, predominantly reflecting our investment in Moderna. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Taken together, we earned $1.50 per share, an increase of 26% excluding exchange.  In summary, the underlying demand for our products in the first quarter, even after adjusting for timing and COVID-19 impacts, delivered very strong growth and demonstrates the continued underlying strength and operational momentum in our business. As we move through the year and eventually put the impact of COVID-19 behind us, this demand will be the foundation upon which we expect to deliver strong and sustained growth into the future. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we head into the second quarter, we are seeing decreased patient visits, due to reduced access to hospitals, and other healthcare providers, as well as social distancing recommendations.  I'd like to pass the call to Frank to provide additional color on the dynamics we are seeing. Thanks, Ken. Now turning to guidance. We expect decreased volumes due to the reduced access and social distancing impacts that Frank described, particularly in the second quarter, which we assume is the peak of the virus in the United States and Europe. We expect to begin to see this dynamic subside as hospitals begin to normalize through the third quarter and as social distancing measures begin to lift across geographies at which point we would expect a phased return to more normal levels of volumes, unencumbered by access concerns.  While we do expect to progress to normal pre-COVID-19 volumes by the beginning of the fourth quarter, a large portion of the impact in Q2 will carry to the full year. In Animal Health, we expect to experience a more protracted recovery timeline, given decreased demand for milk and protein due to the shutdown of restaurants and schools, reduced visits to veterinarians and the impact of reduced employment and incomes. Of course, our actual results could vary based on how the disease progresses, and how various countries respond. We now expect revenues of $46.1 billion to $48.1 billion, which reflects a decrease of $2.5 billion from our previous midpoint. This difference is comprised of approximately $2.1 billion of negative impact due to COVID-19 on an ex-exchange basis, made up of approximately $1.7 billion from Human Health and $400 million in Animal Health. We also now assume a negative impact from foreign exchange of roughly $750 million, or 2.5 percentage points using mid-April rates.  Finally, Human Health operational strength of roughly $300 million partially offsets the negative COVID-19 and foreign exchange impacts. We now expect gross margin to be roughly 75%. Operating expenses are expected to decline at a low-single-digit rate driven by lower SG&A. Our updated assumption anticipates lower promotional and selling expenses and clinical trial costs. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. We continue to expect other expense of roughly $200 million. We continue to anticipate 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Given the current environment and out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily paused our share repurchase activity, which will help ensure that we preserve our strong financial position to pursue our capital allocation priorities of investment in the business and ongoing business development. Taking together, we now expect our non-GAAP EPS to be between $5.17 to $5.37, which reflects a decrease of $0.43 from our previous midpoint. This range includes a roughly 3.5 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency equating to an approximately $0.11 FX headwind versus our prior assumptions. Importantly, the company's financial strength and conservatively positioned balance sheet is allowing us to execute our capital allocation priorities, which remain unchanged despite the currently challenging environment. As of the end of the quarter, we held $8 billion in cash and marketable securities and retained good access to the commercial paper markets.  In addition, our cash collections continue as expected, with no significant disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic impact to-date. As a reminder, our first priority is to invest in our existing R&D programs, as well as to support new programs aimed at COVID-19. This pandemic underscores our commitment to R&D now more than ever. We will continue to invest in manufacturing capacity expansion, and we remain firmly committed to the payment of our dividend.  In addition, as Ken noted, business development remains a priority, and we will continue to look for the best external sources of science to augment our pipeline. We will assess the environment on an ongoing basis and consider reactivating the repurchase program as warranted. In summary, our first quarter results demonstrate the strong demand we see for our innovative portfolio and the underlying fundamental strength in our business. While the pandemic will impact us in the short-term, we're well positioned financially to weather this storm and continue the investments we're making across our business to drive growth and importantly to bring additional innovations to the patients we serve. We also remain confident in the underlying demand of our products based on their competitive position and the benefits that they provide and fully expect to see our growth return once patient access normalizes. As a result, our expectations are unchanged regarding our ability to deliver sustainable long-term growth. We believe all of this continues to be a source of significant and sustainable long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Roger. With regard to maybe the second question first, the pharma guidance is, the majority of that will hit in the second quarter and the majority of it is in the United States. And maybe I'll turn it over to Frank to give you some of the more specifics on product detail before coming back to the first question. Thank you, Frank. And then on your question about share repurchase program, just to be clear, and I had it in the prepared remarks, but it's worth reinforcing. We really decided to temporarily stop the share repurchase program predominantly out of an abundance of caution. Our financial position continues to be strong. And as we said, it really was to make sure that we can continue to do all of the investments we want to do in R&D and CapEx to support our future growth, and in business development, as you asked. So it's really across all those areas that we want to make sure we can prioritize investment. And we will continue to look at it and very well could reinstate the share repurchase as we see the situation evolve in the marketplace. Thanks, Tim, for your question. So if you look at why we lowered guidance, and understand, again, the profile of our business, and I think it's really important that we just really hit this home, it is the fact that we are seeing reduced access is what's driving the reduction in guidance. Because of the fact as Frank said two-thirds of our products are physician administered and that is probably somewhat unique and is causing the impact. And as we said, while we expect to get back to normal by the time we get to the fourth quarter, because we're going to see a large impact mainly in the second quarter, a little bit in the third, that second quarter impact largely carries to the year and it's really what's driving it. The other thing to point out is our Human Health reduction is only a little over half of what's driving the reduction in our guidance. It's actually almost half of it is coming from foreign currency, and the fact that we have the impact in Animal Health. And if you look at it, the impact in Animal Health is actually more significant than it is in the Human Health business. So that is also a little bit of a differentiation relative to some of our peers.  And if you look then at how does that translate down to the bottom-line, what you see is actually for the full year, we're actually bringing down OpEx more than what is the impact of just COVID-19 reductions in spend. Some of that is also due to the way currency is flowing through our operating expense line, but then there is a little bit of incremental savings we also were assuming. I would say we didn't go harder at OpEx primarily because we don't see this as a demand driven issue and we want to be in a position that as the market normalizes we can come back fully with our products. So we're expecting to continue to invest in research and development, R&D will continue to grow and we will continue to make selective investments to be prepared to come back strong, as we see the market normalize. And that's why we've not pulled down OpEx further. But you shouldn't read anything more into this than the mix of our business and the fact that the access is impacting our ability to deliver what we originally expected for the year. Roger on TIGIT? So on a currency basis, if you look at what is driving the reduction, it is entirely just due to change in where we see rates as of mid-April. So basically, we took the mid-April exchange rates and assumed those held for the full year. And as a result of the fact that what you're seeing is that really versus almost every currency, the dollar has strengthened as there has been a flight back to the dollar -- as soon -- as the quality currency and as a defensive measure, that is impacting us. It's hitting us across all of our currencies. But importantly, what's happening as well -- and we're not able to hedge as much as we normally would is because we're also seeing a material impact in the emerging market currencies as well, where we don't hedge today. So it's really that is what's driving entirely the $750 million reduction that we talked about in our guidance. And then on your second question on the timing of the spin out. As Ken noted in his prepared remarks, we continue to expect to have the spin out completed in the first half of 2021. That is consistent with where we guided last quarter. And I would just add on the Animal Health front. It's a similar situation to Human Health. We are seeing the impact now in the quarter and we do expect that the second quarter will be the vast majority of the impact driving what is the full-year reduction. So it definitely will be most acute in the second quarter, but it will continue a little bit into the third and fourth and be a little bit more prolongated than what we expect from the Human Health business, driving a larger downside impact to our Animal Health business than it's having to our Human Health business."

            "name": "Roger Perlmutter",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. I will divide my commentary on our first quarter results into three parts. First, I will describe the current operational status of Merck Research Laboratories, focusing in particular on clinical research and our interactions with regulatory agencies. Second, I will highlight some of the important results that we achieved during the first quarter and will outline some of what we hope to achieve as the year progresses. Finally, I will comment specifically on the actions that we hope and what we have taken to help address the COVID-19 pandemic.  So let me begin with our operational status. As an early point, our global clinical operations team recognized the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 infections that were reported in Wuhan, China, and made advanced preparations to manage what became the COVID-19 pandemic. These preparations included prepositioning clinical supplies, strengthening our clinical supplies network, putting in place processes to enable virtual monitoring and over time developing processes for home deliveries, investigational agents, including in some cases, developing alternative infusion sites. Operating virtually the clinical operations team, including data management and our quality organization has been able to maintain our overall clinical trial schedule. We have in some cases reduced enrollment in certain jurisdictions. But we have not halted enrollment and are continuing to launch new clinical trials across most jurisdictions.  As examples, our team processed 36 database logs in the month of March, and enrolled more than 700 new patients across our Europe, Middle East, Africa sites. These numbers provide substantial reassurance that our clinical programs are moving forward. Indeed, although I cannot predict what the course of the pandemic will be in the future, for now, our 2020 MRL objectives are not in jeopardy. This progress is owed entirely to the extraordinary work of teams across our organizations spanning five continents, and a very broad set of government regulatory agencies with whom we interact.  Turning now to important research accomplishments. As noted previously, the first quarter began with FDA approval of KEYTRUDA as monotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, our 23rd KEYTRUDA indication and we continue to generate important data related to the ability of KEYTRUDA to improve cancer therapy.  An interim analysis of the pivotal Phase 3 KEYNOTE-355 studies demonstrated that KEYTRUDA in combination with standard chemotherapy improved progression-free survival versus chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a combined proportion score of greater than or equal to 10. This result complements the data from our KEYNOTE-522 study in which a combination of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy provided as neoadjuvant treatment versus chemotherapy alone improves the pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing surgery for triple-negative breast cancer. We expect to describe these results in detail at an upcoming medical meeting.  We also announced the results of our KEYNOTE-204 study which demonstrated that KEYTRUDA monotherapy improved progression-free survival in adult patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, as compared with brentuximab vedotin. These data strongly support our current indication in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. And the study will continue to permit evaluation of the dual primary overall survival endpoint. Also during the quarter, we announced the results of our KEYNOTE-177 trial, a Phase 3 study in which monotherapy with KEYTRUDA improved progression-free survival, as compared to standard chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer, whose tumors had demonstrated deficiency in mismatch DNA repair or evidence of DNA microsatellite instability, the so called MSI high phenotype. The study will continue as is customary to permit evaluation of an overall survival endpoint once the data are mature.  Most will recall that in 2017 we gained the very first approval of a tumor agnostic PD-1 directed therapy indication with the identification completed in collaboration with colleagues at Johns Hopkins University of MSI high status as a biomarker for tumor responsiveness. At the end of the first quarter, we also received priority review from the FDA for what we regard as a second potential tumor agnostic indication, the use of KEYTRUDA in certain patients whose tumors have a high mutational burden that is greater than equal to 10 mutations per megabase of DNA, irrespective of tumor type.  We look forward to presenting all of these data at upcoming scientific meetings and in peer reviewed journals. As I've indicated, we are also engaged in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding these data. Finally, we announced last week that based on discussions with the FDA, we have responded to their prior Complete Response Letter and have resubmitted our application for approval of the use of KEYTRUDA in a 400 milligram every six weeks dosage form across all indications in adults, based both upon modeling information and new data that have emerged from our KEYNOTE-555 study, which will be discussed in part at the American Association for Cancer Research Meeting later today.  We've also seen important progress in our partnership with AstraZeneca of Lynparza our leading PARP inhibitor. Just last week, we announced new results from a key secondary endpoint of our PROfound trial, which shows statistically significant improvement in overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose tumors have mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2 genes or the ATM gene, all of which are important for homologous recombination related DNA repair, following treatment of Lynparza as compared with abiraterone or enzalutamide therapy.  The result provides yet another example of the benefit of Lynparza therapy in patients whose tumors have defined DNA repair mutations. I'll remind you that we presented primary data from the PROfound studies at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting in October of 2019. We expect the details of the PROfound study, though not those just announced, will be published in the top tier medical journal in the very near future, perhaps this week.  I should also note with respect to Lynparza that our PAOLA-1 study, a Phase 3 trial examining the combination of Lynparza plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone in the first-line maintenance treatment of women with advanced overall -- ovarian cancer is under review by the FDA for the PDUFA date in the second quarter.  I cannot complete our survey of important results in tumor therapy without mentioning the approval two weeks ago of Koselugo known generically as selumetinib which is the first selected therapy approved for patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who are suffering from symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromis. The approval of Koselugo is part of our longstanding collaboration with colleagues at AstraZeneca, who first identified this important next signal transduction inhibitor.  Beyond oncology, we also advanced important programs in other therapeutic areas. Earlier in the quarter, we had the opportunity to present the results of our Phase 3 VICTORIA study performed in collaboration with colleagues at Bayer which demonstrated that vericiguat, an investigational soluble guanylate cyclase agonist provided benefit as judged by composite endpoints including heart failure hospitalization or cardiovascular death as compared with placebo, when given as add on therapy to well treated patients with established heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who had suffered a worsening event. This represents the first study of its kind in the population at very high risk for further cardiac complications. The data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented virtually at The American College of Cardiology Meeting just last month.  Also during the quarter we announced that in our Phase 3 program, gefapixant, our investigational P2X3 antagonist reduced the 24 hour cough frequency in patients with longstanding chronic cough. Details of these results will also be published and presented in the not too distant future.  Finally, in the metabolic disease area, we have just announced results for the Phase 3 VERTIS CV cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this study conducted jointly by Merck and Pfizer, compared administration of STEGLATRO an oral sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 or SGLT2 inhibitor versus placebo in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic vascular disease, and achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority for major adverse cardiovascular events. These events were defined as time to the first event of CV death non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke.  The key secondary endpoints of superiority for STEGLATRO versus placebo for time to the composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure, CV death alone and the composite of renal death, dialysis/transplant or doubling of serum creatinine from baseline were not met. While not a pre-specified hypothesis for statistical testing, a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure was observed with STEGLATRO. The safety profile of STEGLATRO was consistent with that reported in previous studies. Detailed results of VERTIS CV are scheduled to be presented on June 16th at the virtual American Diabetes Association's 80th Scientific Session.  I will now describe activities during the past quarter directed at developing treatments that could have an impact on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a leading vaccine manufacturer for more than 100 years, it is no surprise that we have embarked upon a broad-based development program for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Let me put these results in the proper context. Vaccine development is extraordinarily difficult and customarily requires many years of investigation. As others have noted during the past quarter century, despite enormous efforts, there have been only seven vaccines directed against previously unaddressed human pathogens that earned registration. Four of these seven were developed by Merck Research Laboratories. And so we have relevant experience in this area.  ERVEBO, our most recent vaccine, which has been demonstrated to provide protection from -- with the Zaire strain of Ebola virus, was developed rapidly and under emergency use authorization to help address outbreaks in West Africa. Nevertheless, there required a multiyear development program and involved building a factory that we're proud to say can produce 1 million doses of vaccine per year. The development and registration of ERVEBO required the efforts of hundreds of our employees as well as an extraordinary commitment from the World Health Organization and then from healthcare workers in Guinea, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and many other jurisdictions. With the COVID-19 pandemic, however, we are tasked with creating a completely new vaccine in 1/10th the time that we devoted to ERVEBO, and we must plan to manufacturer this vaccine at 1,000 times the scale. We approached this challenge with enthusiasm but also with humility. We know from long experience that creating safe and effective vaccines typically requires decades of efforts and investment. We're mindful of the imperative to act with speed indeed with urgency. Based on the progress that we have made, I will say that I am optimistic that a vaccine capable of inducing a potent neutralizing immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can be invented. But it's also critical to develop a comprehensive understanding of this particular coronavirus which will allow us to design, develop and ultimately to manufacture vaccine that can be deployed globally.  With this in mind, we have first supported efforts to characterize effective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. As we announced yesterday, we have partnered with scientists at the Institute for Systems Biology, Swedish hospital, and the Providence health system, all in Seattle, with Stanford University and numerous others to collect cells in sera over multiple time points from patients diagnosed with COVID-19.  Data derived from these analyses will be made available to researchers worldwide, and will position us to cipher correlates of immunity to this coronavirus. With respect to the vaccines themselves, we have been thoughtful in selecting proven platforms that we've used to generate vaccines with desirable qualities in the past. Of course, in light of my prior comments regarding the difficulty of developing successful vaccines, I cannot guarantee to you that any of these approaches will prove effective in the near-term.  However, you should have no doubt that scientists in our own laboratories and those of our collaborators are committed to this process. We've also worked to identify internal resources that can support the manufacture of these potential new vaccines at an appropriate scale. And we are in discussions with contract manufacturers who could assist in what would surely rank as the most challenging vaccine production initiative ever undertaken.  Beyond our search for vaccines, we are also engaged in studying potential antiviral drugs that could be deployed more rapidly. Here too we have evaluated compounds in our own laboratories, and have identified programs at other laboratories that could prove beneficial. Time does not permit me to describe these programs in detail. Instead, I would like to mention that the global community of biopharmaceutical companies has been very open to collaboration to address this challenge.  Within MRL, we are trying to help as many of our colleagues as we possibly can, both through the active consortium led by the National Institutes of Health and also through interactions with many companies large and small, that have contacted us for advice and assistance with their own programs.  I will close by emphasizing that at Merck our mission is to translate breakthrough research into medicines and vaccines that improve and extend life. This mission has never seemed more vital than it does today. I wish to express my gratitude to all of my colleagues here at Merck for working tirelessly in pursuit of a means to ameliorate the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll now return the call back to Peter. Right. Let me speak more generally to the combinations with KEYTRUDA. And it is the case that really since we began -- since I began working with the KEYTRUDA program back in 2013, we have been exploring a whole variety of different combinations with various agents and that's what led us of course to partner with AstraZeneca and Lynparza and partner with Eisai and Lenvima, and has led us to develop a whole set of programs internally that we are using in combination with KEYTRUDA in various clinical studies, including TIGIT, and numerous other biologicals that are well advanced in our program. I've indicated before that we have really quite impressive data in some of these combinations. Most importantly, of course, in our Lenvima combination where we have registration in endometrial cancer and have already presented data for the combination in renal cell carcinoma. But beyond that with the biologicals as well, we are looking for effects that are really meaningful and that will make a big difference from an efficacy standpoint, while preserving the very favorable profile that KEYTRUDA has already demonstrated. So we are making good progress. We're looking forward to developing some of these agents assuming that these play out. And of course, we'll be watching what others do. I think we're in a very good place. Right. Well, thanks. Thanks very much for the question. So first of all, we are interested in any and all approaches that could be helpful in reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we've been in discussion with most all of the organizations that are trying to do this in various different ways, whether that's using passive immunization with antibodies or trying to use alternative methods of active immunization that are -- can more rapidly be brought into the clinic like nucleic acids, mRNA in particular. And of course, we have a long history of collaboration with people who have done that kind of work.  Our sense, though, is that -- the task before us is one that requires a vaccine that will be quite stimulatory and that will yield neutralizing antibodies ideally with a single immunization. Of course, it must first be safe because you're talking about a vaccine that would in principle be given to much of the world's population in order to protect the world's population. And since we believe that virtually everyone is susceptible, these are all high bars. And that makes us want to return to proven platforms that have these kinds of characteristics. And that's where we have put our focus. My expectation is that over time, we will need more than one vaccine in order to actually protect the human population from SARS-CoV-2. So that's sort of thing that we've looked at.  Specifically with respect to the neutralizing antibodies being administered as passive vaccination, we've looked at a number of those. In the near term that may turn out to be a useful approach for individuals who -- perhaps in the treatment context and also for individuals who are at extraordinarily high risk and have a great susceptibility because of age and comorbidities. But it's a broadly based method to protect the human population I think, probably less likely to be used just for logistical reasons. That doesn't mean that we wouldn't be willing to work with others to help develop that if that proved to be the near term -- the most important thing that one could do.  Finally, I would say that just to put the cart back behind the horse, and the issue of selective pressure and mutation, we should recognize that while right now we're not seeing an enormous amount of variation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, when we put selective pressure on the virus either with an antiviral drug and some of those do indeed look fairly promising early on or with a vaccine it is possible that we will see variants emerge and those variants can prove to be important. And that's something else that we're paying quite a bit of attention to. Yes, David. So with respect to novel immuno-oncology agents, I mean I've mentioned some of this before in response to a prior question, but we have a stable of them. We're of course looking at our own CTLA-4 molecule, have been for some time in combination with KEYTRUDA. We are also looking at LAG-3, TIGIT and a whole variety of others. We have 20 or so agents that we have tested in the clinic and all of these are being tested versus monotherapy and thereafter as combination with KEYTRUDA. But I should emphasize that KEYTRUDA really is quite special. We've not seen anything of course that has characteristics that are like KEYTRUDA. If we did, that would be a very different story. And it's no surprise because we and many other investigators, university-based investigators, myself included, looked for these kinds of things for decades and never found anything that looked like KEYTRUDA. It's unlikely we're just going to kick one over now when we didn't have those in the past. That doesn't mean though that those things in combination with KEYTRUDA couldn't be beneficial and we're seeing some early signs that suggest that's possible and we'll have quite a lot more to say about that during the coming year. And the second question had to do with our conviction with respect to our 15-valent molecule V114 for invasive pneumococcal disease. We have a lot of conviction behind it. I think we've already reported our Phase 2 data that everyone has had a chance to see. The Phase 3 data will be available to us very, very soon. And as soon as those data become available, assuming the data Phase 3 recapitulate what we saw in Phase 2, which is certainly our hope and expectation, those -- the top-line of those data will be announced of course and we'll at that point provide more clarity with respect to our filing plans. But our expectation would be that filing could occur not long thereafter. So we're really very enthusiastic about this vaccine because of the important new serotypes in it and also the balance with respect to the immune response that we saw in our V114 studies in Phase 2. Yes, Steve. Thanks for the question. So first of all on vericiguat and the VICTORIA study, so the VICTORIA study address a patient population that typically is excluded from most studies and these are patients who have had a recent de-compensation in their status. These are patients with reduced ejection fraction, heart failure, who have typically undergone heart failure hospitalization as a result of some deterioration. And hence, this is a very brittle population if you looked at the data that were published. But what you saw with it was that these patients were really quite ill and had indices of heart failure, of heart stress that were much, much higher than what is typically found in a heart failure population. So the reason why the paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the reason why it was -- there was a plenary presentation at the American College of Cardiology on these results is precisely because this is a very different population, the therapy is given as add-on to existing heart failure therapies and improves outcomes. And so, that's a pretty important result and I think there is a lot of enthusiasm for it within the cardiovascular community and amongst those physicians who treat heart failure. So I think that's really important to recognize. This is really a -- quite a change in terms of how we think about these patients and it's an important patient population to treat. And then with respect to the gefapixant, well of course, we haven't presented the gefapixant data. We'll have a chance to do that. I think everyone should recognize two things; the first is that chronic cough is an extremely common complaint in the general population. So physicians are often called upon to try and help people who are interrupted by chronic cough and in our Phase 3 studies we had some individuals who have had chronic cough complaints, continuous chronic cough complaints for more -- for decades. So this is a pretty significant interruption in their lives.  On the other hand, I don't want to dismiss the difficulty of going into a completely new area, because there are no -- there hasn't been no drug registered for chronic cough. There's been no study of this kind previously. It's a completely novel area. It will take some time for this to develop and for people to understand it. Right, Okay. For TMB-High, so this -- the basis for seeking registration is a study done in a variety of different tumor types, the KEYNOTE-158 study in which their responses at the moment are currently inadequate. And so the goal was to look and see, well was there anything that we could do in these tumor types in which we could demonstrate that KEYTRUDA had an effect in certain patients, and we looked at a variety of different markers so that we could use. It turned out for us that a tumor mutational burden marker at greater than 10 mutations per megabase was associated with an improved overall response in certain of these tumors and that's what we've sought registration for and we are in the midst of having those discussions with the agency. So we'll see what happens. I frankly am not aware of off-label use and we wouldn't necessarily know anything about that in that population. And with regard to our KRAS program, it's actually quite a broad program looking at both GDP and GTP bound forms of KRAS and looking at the mutations beyond the cysteine mutation, codon 12 mutation, veiled cyst mutation which occurs in a fraction of patients, but there of course are many other mutations, aspartic acid substitution, valiant substitution et cetera. So we're looking quite broadly, but it will be a while before we have the opportunity to bring the first of those compounds into the clinic. Well Andrew, thank you -- thanks for the question. Again on TIGIT, different companies will have different perspectives on this. Our view really is still quite simple and it's not -- I wouldn't over think this. What we want to see is sufficient evidence of benefit in combination which is -- where you can unambiguously say that both elements, that is KEYTRUDA in our case and the anti-TIGIT antibody, both elements and that same is true for LAG-3 or CTLA-4 or any others are each contributing and so that there is at least additive effect and ideally better than that if one could get it. And so, we want to be absolutely sure of that and we want to be absolutely sure that we're addressing the right patient populations and of course we want to be sure that there is no deterioration in the favorable adverse experience profile of KEYTRUDA. So it's just a matter of reaching a conclusion about that. We could eventually reach the conclusion that you know we don't actually think it's good enough and there could be a whole variety of reasons for that or we could reach the conclusion, yes, we think this is really important, let's move forward. There are a number of programs in which we are sort of looking at that and we are going to find some data that's intriguing, but we just don't have enough data yet to make us feel comfortable about it. Other people might look at that data and say we need to go immediately. We are doing what we think is the right thing in that regard. Right. So Seamus that the -- we're quite data driven on this. We were enthusiastic about Lenvima initially from the monotherapy data that our colleagues at Eisai had obtained and we thought there was a chance that that could prove to be a good combination with KEYTRUDA. We had -- we did some experiments like that with them and then we signed our agreement with them. And when we signed our agreement, we thought let's do a signal detection study looking across a broad set of tumors. And as we've done that, we've seen a lot of really quite interesting signals. Those of course weren't the only combinations with multi-kinase inhibitors that we tried, but we've seen impressive signals in combination with KEYTRUDA. And as you know, every multi-kinase inhibitor is different. Each one hits a different range of molecules and their effects are different. So it's quite hard to describe why that's true and whether that reflects VEGF receptor-antagonism in the context of FGF receptor or whatever. But what you can say is that they're all different and the results that we've obtained with Lenvima have been very promising. So we are quite enthusiastic, obviously, first of all in endometrial, in other tumors, the data we presented for renal and there are many others besides. So we're moving forward with that program."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2021 has been a year of significant achievements and meaningful progress for Merck in the face of what has been a challenging environment for all of us. We delivered on our strategic priorities and took important steps to set a foundation for success in 2022 and beyond. We achieved strong operational performance, accelerated our broad pipeline, including molnupiravir, completed the spin-off of Organon, and acted on key strategic business development activities. We enter 2022 with strong momentum, and are pleased to reflect this in our initial revenue and EPS guidance. We continue to evolve with a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company, with an increased urgency to bring forward innovations to address critical unmet needs. This remains the core of our strategy to benefit the patients we serve, and in turn, create long-term value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. Our business achieved strong revenue and earnings growth. Total revenues increased 24% in the quarter and 17% for the full year. Commercially, we have executed extremely well across all of our key performance drivers, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. We delivered initial molnupiravir shipments to customers around the world, and following the FDA Emergency Use Authorization that was granted in late December, made meaningful progress towards our commitment to the U.S. government. Our dedicated teams worked diligently, including through the holiday season, to deliver 1.4 million courses of therapy to the United States, United Kingdom and other countries by year-end. Throughout 2021, we invested in the discovery, development, production and commercialization of medicines and vaccines, furthering the long-term sustainability of our business, all while delivering meaningful operating leverage and strong EPS growth. In total, 2021 was a year of strong execution of our strategic priorities across all fronts: operationally, commercially, clinically and financially. As we look at 2022 and out to 2025 and beyond, we expect to achieve continued strong growth. Our oncology portfolio will benefit from the uptake of numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains robust, and further growth will be realized through the investments we are making to increase manufacturing capacity. And, our Animal Health business remains very well positioned to grow faster than the market, well into the future. Overall, we expect another year of strong revenue growth in 2022. While we will continue to make investments in our pipeline, we are confident that we can achieve a leveraged P&L and significant long-term operating margin expansion. Longer term, we are intensely focused on successfully navigating the headwind created by likely biosimilar competition to KEYTRUDA at the end of the decade. We aspire to grow through and beyond this period. But, at the very least, we will look to minimize the headwind and shorten the time it takes to return to strong growth. We have multiple levers to achieve this task, driving sustained growth well into the next decade. First, we intend to strengthen our leadership in oncology broadly and leverage that position for sustained long-term success. We\u2019ve done an excellent job of establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational therapy, and we intend to maximize its opportunity and patient impact. In addition, we have an expanding portfolio of commercial and developmental oncology assets beyond KEYTRUDA, which offer meaningful growth opportunities beyond 2028. Second, we have many important franchises beyond oncology that we expect can drive durable growth into the next decade, including GARDASIL, which we believe can potentially double by 2030, as well as our pneumococcal portfolio and our Animal Health business, to name a few. Third, we expect to generate very strong cash flow, which we intend to deploy into value-enhancing business development to augment our pipeline and bring additional drivers of longer-term growth. And fourth, we will advance our internal pipeline and the opportunities we see in vaccines, cardiometabolic, neuroscience and other disease areas. We are making extensive investments in discovery research as well, which we believe will be the source of longer-term innovation. As part of our commitment to provide more transparency into these efforts, we will host an investor event focused on our cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline in the spring. In addition to accelerating our internal pipeline, as I noted, a key part of our strategy will be to deploy our cash flow towards the value-enhancing business development. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in pursuing compelling external innovation. And we will supplement our pipeline with an approach that is science-led, but portfolio informed. Last year\u2019s acquisitions of Pandion and Acceleron are good examples of our approach. We are taking calculated risks and we\u2019ll continue to focus on creating value in areas of unmet need. We have the operational capabilities, financial capacity, scientific prowess and sufficient runway before the end of the decade for business development to play an important role in our goal of achieving long-term sustainable growth. While we have a strong track record of business development, we know we need to do more. Finally, we\u2019ve taken further steps to integrate important environmental, social and governance goals into the core of our business. In December, we completed the inaugural issuance of a $1 billion sustainability bond. We intend to use the net proceeds to support projects and partnerships in the Company\u2019s priority ESG areas and to contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. We\u2019ve also acted to accelerate global access for molnupiravir through our groundbreaking access strategy, including a recent agreement with UNICEF for up to 3 million courses of therapy to supplement supply available for distribution in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, this morning, we announced plans to host our initial ESG investor event on February 23rd. We believe that strong performance across key ESG metrics aligns well with Merck\u2019s core values and mission. And we look forward to providing insights into our commitment to this space. Now, before I turn the call over to Caroline, I want to take a moment to recognize Frank Clyburn. Following 14 years of significant contributions, Frank will be leaving Merck to become CEO of IFF. I want to thank Frank for the strategic vision and operational excellence he\u2019s provided in helping establish Merck as a global leader in oncology and for his strong leadership of our Human Health business. We wish Frank and his family all the best as he embarks on his new endeavor. While Frank will be missed, we are well positioned to continue our strong momentum with the deep and talented team we have in place, and we expect to announce new leader shortly. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Caroline to provide details into the performance of our business as well as our financial results and outlook. Caroline?\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2021 was a year of exceptional performance for our business. We drove robust top line growth of 17% and bottom line growth of 33%. Our teams performed with agility and executed with excellence, despite challenges from the ongoing pandemic. We are also very proud of the significant efforts to bring molnupiravir to patients worldwide. These results reinforce the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for strong growth. We will continue to invest in our portfolio and pipeline as well as in business development to maximize growth over the near and long term and to create value for patients and shareholders. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.5 billion, an increase of 24% or 23% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. Molnupiravir contributed $952 million in revenue or 9 percentage points of growth. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum, growing 23%, driven by our key pillars and contribution from molnupiravir. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust performance with sales increasing 8%, driven by companion animal products. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 16% to $4.6 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors and is benefiting from the recent launches in neo-adjuvant and adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and in cervical cancer. KEYTRUDA continues to extend its strong IO class leadership and maintain its position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients, despite competition. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck and RCC. We continue to expand our reach into earlier lines. We were very pleased to receive two additional adjuvant approvals this quarter in RCC and in melanoma. With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has now received 5 indications in earlier-stage cancers. If approved, we also look forward to expanding into adjuvant lung cancer following the encouraging top line results from the KEYNOTE-091 trial. We are confident that along with strong clinical data, KEYTRUDA\u2019s reputation and familiarity among physicians will be a benefit as we move into early stage disease. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Growth of 33% was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including prostate. Our expected launch in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial represents a significant opportunity. Lenvima sales grew 31%, driven by RCC and endometrial cancer in the U.S. We have seen very encouraging early trends in new patient share following the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line RCC. We are also excited by the recent launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients and is off to a promising start. We expect to extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our Vaccines portfolio again delivered strong growth, driven by GARDASIL, which grew 50% to $1.5 billion and nearly 40% for the full year. Outside the U.S., he U.S., robust growth was driven by strong underlying demand across all key geographies and particularly China as well as increased supply. This growth more than offset the decline in the U.S. due to timing of CDC purchases as well as the replenishment of the CDC stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also impacting HPV immunization levels was the prioritization of COVID vaccinations in younger age cohorts. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains strong, as it is increasingly being recognized as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both, females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 24%, driven by increased usage of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and BRIDION\u2019s growing share within the class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales increasing 8%. Companion animal sales increased 26%, driven by global demand in parasiticide, including the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as vaccines. Recall that we experienced changes in distributor purchasing patterns, which negatively impacted last year\u2019s results. Livestock sales was flat, as strong global demand for poultry and swine products was offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the recording of an extra month of sales relating to Antelliq in the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.8%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points. As a reminder, we share profits from molnupiravir equally with our partner, Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin. This impact was largely offset by favorable mix and lower discards. Operating expenses increased 3% to $5.3 billion as we continued to invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $50 million. Our full year tax rate was 11.2%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to a more favorable mix of income and expense than previously estimated. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 4.3% reflects the impacts of the lower full year rate as well as foreign tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.80 per share. It is worth noting that our underlying operating results were towards the upper end of our expectations and the contributions from molnupiravir and the favorable tax rate resulted in EPS that exceeded our price guidance. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. We believe the strong underlying momentum in our business will continue, and we will also benefit from increased molnupiravir revenues. We expect revenue to be between $56.1 billion and $57.6 billion, representing growth of 15% to 18%, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, driven in part by the addition of R&D expenses related to the Acceleron acquisition. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.12 to $7.27, reflecting growth of 18% to 21%. This range includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% using mid-January rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on molnupiravir. We are excited by our regulatory authorizations to date and believe molnupiravir will be an important treatment option to combat the ongoing pandemic. We have announced a number of supply and purchase agreements, providing approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Based on agreements now in place, we are confident in our ability to achieve $5 billion to $6 billion in revenues in 2022, weighted to the first half of the year. Next, we expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, which would benefit from increased expansion in ex U.S. market and the continued ramp of recent launches globally. On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust demand along with increased supply to drive strong year-over-year growth, albeit not at the same pace as in 2021. In the U.S., increased uptake in the mid adult cohort as well as catch up from missed doses due to pandemic will drive growth. Outside the U.S. we continue to expect strong demand across regions, particularly in China and from a relaunch in Japan. Global HPV vaccination levels remain low, and we continue to believe GARDASIL\u2019s opportunity for growth is significant. In pneumococcal, we are excited by the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in adults and the potential opportunity for approval in pediatric, which represents a larger portion of the pneumococcal market. We expect some offset however from the impact to U.S. sales of PNEUMOVAX23 as the market continues to shift towards newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We also expect to experience modest LOE pressure on JANUVIA in the second half of 2022, as we lose exclusivity in some of the larger ex-U.S. markets. For Animal Health, given our broad and innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to again drive above-market growth in 2022 and beyond. Finally, as we look out to 2025, we remain confident in our ability to achieve strong revenue growth, driven largely by our derisked portfolio and operating margins in excess of 43%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We also continue to augment our internal pipeline through strategic business development. We were active in 2021, including the acquisitions of Acceleron and Pandion, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, our growth in the fourth quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and in the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength. And our continued execution will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. I will provide a brief summary of notable achievements in 2021 and then report on progress since the last earnings call. In 2021, we made meaningful advancements across our broader pipeline with approvals for new molecular entities, including VAXNEUVANCE, Verquvo and WELIREG, and an EUA for molnupiravir. We also made strides in women\u2019s cancers with U.S. regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA in cervical, endometrial and triple-negative breast cancer. In total, we received more than 30 approvals and filed more than 20 NDAs and sBLAs in the United States, EU, Japan and China. In 2022, we look to build on this progress and momentum. I will now cover notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates for our molnupiravir, oncology, pneumococcal, HIV and cardiovascular programs. As we enter the third year of the pandemic, the Omicron variant continues to wreak havoc on our communities and health care systems. In the United States alone, we are now seeing approximately 2,000 deaths a day. Vaccines and treatment options have the potential to help combat this pandemic. Since the first authorization for molnupiravir by the UK in November, we have received authorizations in 9 additional countries, including an Emergency Use Authorization in the United States and a special approval for emergency in Japan. In addition, other countries have provided authorizations to our voluntary license holders. Findings from the MOVe-OUT clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of last year showed molnupiravir significantly reduced hospitalization or death in adult patients most in danger of progressing to severe disease. Importantly, for physicians and patients, approximately 90% fewer deaths were seen in those taking molnupiravir. These results reinforce that molnupiravir can provide an important oral treatment option for certain adults at high risk for severe illnesses. The Director of the United States CDC has indicated the need to prioritize therapeutic interventions for people with the highest risk of progression, such as those with certain comorbidities. We believe molnupiravir\u2019s low propensity for drug-drug interactions make it a meaningful and important option for appropriate patients with COVID-19 who are receiving treatments for underlying conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, and for those with impaired liver or kidney function, consistent with local recommendations. To date, this pandemic has consisted of successive waves of SARS-CoV2 variants, most recently, Omicron. Last week, we announced data from multiple independent studies indicating that molnupiravir is active against the Omicron variant in vitro. Each surge comes with distinct public health and disease characteristics and corresponding treatment and prevention challenges. The potential threat of rapidly emerging variants reinforces the need for treatment options with high barrier to resistance that target evolutionarily conserved aspects of viral biology. Recognizing the importance of an oral antiviral, we committed to manufacturing molnupiravir and have it ready for supply to patients within the U.S. upon emergency use authorization. As Caroline noted, we were able to fulfill that promise and ensure delivery of this important treatment. We are working with governments and partners around the globe to stay ahead of the curve and to further Merck\u2019s contribution in fighting this pandemic. Next, we continue to fortify our position in oncology. Several recent milestones highlight our strategy of targeting earlier-stage cancers where there is potential for improved outcomes by reducing risk of recurrence. We received FDA and European Commission approval for KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for renal cell carcinoma and FDA approval for certain stages of melanoma. In RCC, approval was based on KEYNOTE-564. KEYTRUDA is the first and only immunotherapy treatment option for certain patients at intermediate, high or high risk of recurrence in the adjuvant setting. And in melanoma, the approval was based on KEYNOTE-716 and provides for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with stage IIB and IIC disease, following complete resection. Both approvals provide patients with important new options shown to help reduce the risk of recurrence. Similarly, we recently announced a positive finding from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARLS study, evaluating KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection. At an interim analysis, the trial met one of its dual primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival in all comers when treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo. The trial will continue to analyze DFS in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, the other dual primary endpoint, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis, as well as overall survival, a key secondary endpoint. We are continuing to make progress in women\u2019s cancer based on data from the Phase 3 OlympiA trial. The FDA granted priority review for Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative, high-risk early breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy, either before or after surgery. We anticipate FDA action during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the broader portfolio. The FDA issued a complete response letter for the new drug applications for gefapixant and have requested additional information related to the measurement of efficacy. There were no safety concerns for gefapixant. And we will continue with the FDA to discuss next steps as we look to address the significant unmet need in patients with chronic cough. In Japan, we are pleased to announce the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LYFNUA, the trademark for gefapixant for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Momentum continues in our pneumococcal disease program, following the U.S. approval in July 2021, the European Commission VAXNEUVANCE in individuals 18 years of age and older in December. Also in December, we announced the FDA granted priority review of our supplemental application for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting. Importantly, VAXNEUVANCE incorporates serotypes 22F and 33F up and provides robust response on other key disease-causing serotypes, like serotype 3, therefore, offering the potential to prevent additional invasive disease in children. We anticipate regulatory action in the spring of this year. Merck has a proud legacy of HIV research, and we remain committed to those impacted by this virus. Following the announcement of the FDA clinical hold for ongoing trials evaluating islatravir, we are working to understand the data and the principles of the finding. We believe in the potential of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase and translocation inhibitor mechanism for both the prevention and treatment of HIV. And we intend to share updates in the future. Looking across our broader pipeline. As Rob noted, in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Acceleron. Its lead candidate, sotatercept, is an excellent complement to our pipeline and has the potential to provide a novel approach to treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The integration is proceeding according to plan, and the Phase 3 program is on track. We plan to provide further details on our cardiovascular pipeline at an investor event in the spring. In closing, 2021 was a tremendous year where we demonstrated our ability to advance both our internal and external pipelines. We are well positioned to continue our momentum into 2022, with a dual focus: becoming the leading oncology company by 2025 and sustaining that position beyond 2028, while also extending our impact across other therapeutic areas. I look forward to providing further updates in the coming year. Now, I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Grace, would you please start the Q&A? And we\u2019d like to ask analysts to limit themselves to one question this morning, in order to get to as many questioners as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: I guess, one for Dean or for Rob. How strategically important is molnupiravir? Is the goal to maximize the revenue this year assuming that resistance doesn\u2019t emerge, or are you guys making investments in a potential combination to turn this business into maybe a longer contributor? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So, as we look at molnupiravir, we\u2019re obviously -- you heard from Caroline, the guidance we\u2019re giving for this year, but I think you\u2019ve hit upon an important point, which we do see the potential for molnupiravir beyond the current situation with COVID-19 and the pandemic, given the fact that it does have such good activity more broadly in mRNA viruses, and as we believe, it can be pan-coronavirus effective. And as we showed recently with six preclinical studies, working well against the Omicron variant, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to work against future variants. But maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Dean to expand upon what we\u2019re thinking about from a developmental perspective for longer term.\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. So, if I may, let\u2019s just frame how many deaths we have a day in the United States. I mean, it\u2019s quite staggering where we are at this point. Now, I would just emphasize molnupiravir is an oral drug as all know. It\u2019s effective in reducing hospitalization and death. And I really think when we think about the death rate in the United States and throughout, having access to medicines that can reduce mortality greater than 80%, 85%, 90% is going to be really important. And molnupiravir is one of such drugs that can do that. And I think that needs to be sort of emphasized throughout. Now, in relationship to molnupiravir directly, those people who we have to be concerned about drug-drug interactions or renal insufficiency or liver insufficiency are often those people at the highest risk. And the fact that molnupiravir has a profile that is really useful in those patients is important. I do want to emphasize that by first principle, the whole mechanism and the molecule is designed to be as variant proof as can be theoretically possible. And what we\u2019ve seen with the Omicron and potentially what we will see with other variants is that theoretical becomes real. With Omicron, for example, all of a sudden, there\u2019s a series of antibody treatments that are no longer effective. And then the other point that I would make is, when we sent our EUA in October, we also held hands that we would be able to produce, supply, distribute this drug immediately. And I think that\u2019s been shown that when we send our EUA in October, we were in that position. And we demonstrated when we got an EUA in late December how fast we could distribute. And I just want to emphasize that I think that when one looks at the death rate when we sent in our EUA and what the death rate now is, it\u2019s threefold higher. So, I just want to emphasize that. When you think about the future, I suppose there is different bookends with one can think through. And the different bookends would be, okay, maybe we could get a really lethal sub variant. Then that issue of us having a resistance profile that we\u2019re very confident about could be really important. The other possibility of a bookend is that this becomes sort of more endemic. So, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s getting it. It\u2019s not necessarily that lethal for healthy people. But in that situation, like in flu, it is the most vulnerable patients are the ones who need to get treated. And that most vulnerable population are often those people you have to worry about drug-drug interactions, renal and liver insufficiency. So, in that context with just COVID-19, that\u2019s how we think about molnupiravir. In relationship to your question about eventually, does the field have to really think about combination? I do think. And I do think it\u2019s important that we have an arsenal of multiple mechanism-of-actions, because in every viral disease that I know, the virus is pretty good at evading different mechanisms of action. And I think we may have to think about this combination issue that you\u2019ve talked about. And we have invested both in internal resources and other mechanisms of action. And we\u2019re in conversations with other people with different mechanism of action. So, the fundamental thing is I think we need to have a view that we need to be prepared that we\u2019re going to need multiple options, and molnupiravir is an important part of the arsenal that this -- the United States and globally will need to have.\nCaroline Litchfield: And if I may add, this is Caroline. We have guided to $5 billion to $6 billion of revenue this year. That\u2019s on the basis of approximately 10 million courses. To Dean\u2019s point, our company remains focused on ensuring there is enough supply depending on how things move forward. So, we are still committed to the 10 million courses we did manufacture in 2021 and more than double that in 2022. So, we will have in excess of 30 million courses to support how the pandemic and how the use of molnupiravir progresses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: On KEYTRUDA, important part of that leadership strategy is the adjuvant opportunity as both combinations with the adjuvant. Can you just comment a little bit more in terms of what you think you\u2019re seeing so far and how that\u2019s progressing? And with the combinations, it looks like the data is scheduled to read out more in the \u201824, \u201825 time frame. Dean perhaps, is there an opportunity that we might potentially be able to get a look earlier than then on any of the combination efforts? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Right. So, I just want to emphasize, there are two types of combinations that we have. We have an IO-IO combination, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to, in relationship to KEYTRUDA, whether it\u2019s with our TIGIT LAG3, CTLA-4 and that. And you\u2019re right, those readouts are event-driven and such. And that will be -- we\u2019ll see where it is, but I think your timing is a reasonable sort of timing in terms of Phase 3 readouts. In relationship to other combinations, I want to draw your attention to the combinations of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy, with other ADCs that we\u2019ve worked with other companies with. But I would also focus your attention also on the readouts of KEYTRUDA with Lenvima, that continue to spool up, [ph] and KEYTRUDA with Lynparza. And the reason why I think that\u2019s important is, we think about how to raise the immuno-oncology profile of KEYTRUDA with other I-O agents. But also, as we see Lynparza and Lenvima, they are -- they give us readouts of how to think about DNA repair and recombination in second and third generation of different sort of compounds in that place. And also, in relationship to Lenvima, where you\u2019re looking at blocking vascular endothelial growth factor, RTKs, it gives us a thought as to how to think of drugs such as WELIREG, which also plays in that sort of same sort of place. And so, we\u2019re very interested in seeing how WELIREG plays out in sporadic renal cell carcinoma. And then, we will ask ourselves outside of renal cell carcinoma where else should it play where an anti-angiogenesis agent has been shown to be effective.\nRob Davis: Yes. And maybe, Chris, just to answer the first part of your question, how are we seeing the adjuvant space? Obviously, we are very excited about moving into earlier lines of therapy. We think this is a real area of growth. Obviously, the strength we\u2019re seeing in KEYTRUDA is about how we\u2019re able to expand into new indications and continue to broaden. If you look, we had just in 2021 alone 21 approvals of new or expanded indications for KEYTRUDA. Three of those were in the adjuvant space, with adjuvant, triple-negative breast cancer, adjuvant renal cell carcinoma and moving into a stage 2 cancer in adjuvant melanoma. So, important growth there. And if you look at that combined with the remaining other indications we already have and the other ones in adjuvant mel and what we hope to have soon with KEYNOTE-091 in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer, we\u2019re looking at movement into the earlier spaces, driving approximately 50% of the growth for the drug for KEYTRUDA through 2025. And we think by 2025, it will be about 30% of our total revenue coming from the adjuvant indications we have. So, this is an area where we\u2019re starting to put runs on the board. And I think we\u2019re going to show that the breadth of what KEYTRUDA could do both in maintenance as well as in the metastatic space is going to be very important as we build the leadership for the long term.\nPeter Dannenbaum: And to be clear, Rob\u2019s referencing the U.S. markets.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: I\u2019d like to ask about a more obscure pipeline agent. Sanofi believes that there is no discernible evidence of benefit of the Merck RSV monoclonal antibody versus the Sanofi monoclonal antibody, and that Sanofi is so far ahead that Sanofi unquestionably will dominate. So, I\u2019m wondering what Merck thinks. And if you disagree with Sanofi, then why is your antibody better than theirs? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. I want to be a little bit careful that I\u2019m answering questions about another company\u2019s drug. I think that having monoclonal antibodies that can treat RSV in a really important patient population is critical. We have data that will be coming out, and we\u2019ll have to see what that data looks like. But we do think that there is opportunity to have a really effective drug that really is easier to provide to that patient population. So, I\u2019m a little bit hesitant to comment directly. But we are very confident in the profile of our RSV antibody studies, and we will just have to see what the clinical data looks like as the clinical data comes through.\nOperator: Next, we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nJon Miller: Hi, guys. This is Jon Miller on for Umer. Thanks so much for taking the question. On islatravir, is there -- obviously, the long duration and the long PK here is a major selling point. But is there any chance to avoid CD4 monitoring or maybe to get around some of the potential product issues that you\u2019ve been looking at or evaluating. If you stick to sub milligram daily dose rather than trying to push for the weekly or monthly doses, is that a potential path forward for islatravir in the HIV franchise?\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. So, let me take that. So, we are evaluating a considerable body of data. You mentioned trends of lymphocytes that have been observed in different trials that we\u2019ve had. I would point out that our Phase 3 with islatravir doravirine demonstrated the efficacy and just the highly efficacious nature of islatravir in that combination, which is QD. We will have a near-term evaluation of the future options, but we are still very committed to this longer acting sort of point of view as well. So to get to your question, we have data in relationship to QD islatravir, doravirine and it\u2019s highly efficacious. We are going to look at the body of data in relationship to are there ways to continue to make that long sort of resident time, be able to have a less frequent either prep or a treatment. And we\u2019re evaluating that data as we speak.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein from Mizuho.\nMara Goldstein: I\u2019m wondering, in the last couple of weeks, there have been a number of comments made by some of your competitors around valuations in M&A. And since you did discuss acquisitions as part of strategy, I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe opine as well as to where you think valuations are relative to the overall strategy of continuing to supplement the Company\u2019s pipeline?\nRob Davis: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mara. So, as you pointed out, we are seeing in the biotech space, valuations have pulled back quite a bit of late. I think it\u2019s too early to see whether or not this is a permanent rebasing in the market or if it is just a temporary change in the marketplace. We need to see how that plays out. And the other thing that\u2019s going to be important is what happens with the investment flows into the space. You are seeing IPOs start to slow. And it would be interesting to see if cash investments start to also slow down as people look to invest into the space with a lower valuation in the market, as you point out. Whether or not that drives to sellers being willing to see the restatement of value that will allow us to do deals at different levels, we\u2019ll have to see. But it doesn\u2019t change the importance we see of doing business development for the Company. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused, first and foremost, on driving and accelerating our own pipeline, but we know we have to augment it. And we are going to continue to focus in this area, and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019re going to find the opportunities where the scientific opportunity match to our capabilities and where we see good value, will allow us to do value-enhancing deals regardless of the market situation.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Adam on behalf of Tim Anderson. On your oral PCSK9 program, you say that you\u2019re going into Phase 2 in 2022. Assuming that this takes two years to wrap up, what would a Phase 3 trial look like in terms of length and comparator? Guessing that this might not take until the late 2020 to report out. Thanks.\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. Thank you for that question. So the question is about our oral PCSK9 drug. We presented the Phase 1 sort of readouts in relationship to that. The Phase 2 readouts will be very important. As everyone recognizes, cardiovascular risk is just a tremendous risk throughout. It\u2019s actually -- you could view it as an epidemic that continues. And there will be two sort of important considerations to take. One is, as we advance the oral PCSK9, the biomarker of reducing LDL is a powerful biomarker that has been established as an important biomarker that has provided a path for registration based on that, even prior to having sort of readouts in terms of cardiovascular outcomes in terms of death and heart patient end points. So, we believe that we\u2019re going to have to do both. But we\u2019re very eager to see how well this agent works in our Phase 2 trials in driving the levels of LDL down. And that will give us the confidence to really advance this for patients. But again, driving the LDL down will be an important registrational point that has been a path for other drugs as well. But we will also have to do outcome study in addition to that.\nOperator: Next up, we have Matt Harrison from Arris. [Ph]\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Charlie Young for Matthew. Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide, in terms of your launch expectation of VAXNEUVANCE this year and perhaps even next year, especially after the pediatric indication approval? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. So, obviously, we\u2019re very excited about what VAXNEUVANCE, the opportunity that this presents, starting with, as you point out, the adult indication, which we received. And as you probably know, we did do the MMWR come out and validate the ACIP recommendation. So we\u2019re at a point now where reimbursement is established in the marketplace, and we are beginning to ship product. As we look at this, we see a real opportunity, because if we look at what is the profile of VAXNEUVANCE in combination with PNEUMOVAX23, you\u2019re looking at an agent that has the broadest coverage. Between the two, we have 15 serotypes in VAXNEUVANCE. We\u2019re adding 9 additional serotypes, 4 which are unique to PNEUMOVAX23. And as we look at the coverage, obviously, in things like serotype 3, we showed with VAXNEUVANCE that we are very competitive, if not superior to competition in the marketplace. And we know that serotype 3 is an important contributor and driver of disease, as is serotypes 22F and 33F, which are in ours as well. So, as we look at it, you\u2019ve got very broad coverage. You\u2019ve got important coverage in high disease-causing serotypes. And we have important data showing how the drug works in at-risk and immunocompromised patients, which will be in the label -- is in the label. So, we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019re going to have to obviously fight it out at the commercial level, but we think we\u2019re well positioned to do that. And we already are starting to look forward to what we see in the pediatric space. Right now, hopefully, we\u2019re going to see -- with the PDUFA in April, we\u2019re going to see hopefully the opportunity to get that drug into the marketplace. But obviously, we\u2019re going to build on the momentum from the launch in adults to then carry that forward into the pediatric setting. So, so far, all started well, good contracting underway, and we\u2019re off to a good start. Thanks.\nOperator: We have Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A question on islatravir. Are you in a position to disprove mitochondrial toxicity as the cause for the lymphocyte compression, or would you file for approval for the once-a-day combination if you have no clear line of sight on a longer dosing period formulations?\nDr. Dean Li: You broke up just a little bit. In relationship to the mechanism by which the lymphocyte trend that we disclosed is going down, we\u2019re looking at the mechanism of action. I would say just two brief points. One is, there\u2019s a question of whether or not there are ways to get around it by looking at the dose that was provided. And then, the second sort of question is the mechanism. The mechanism, we\u2019re still evaluating. I believe your question was in relationship with mitochondrial toxicity. That does not list as the first place that we would go in relationship to the data that we have right now. But I don\u2019t want to rule out anything right now, as we\u2019re evaluating all the data as we speak.\nOperator: Next, we have Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So, I want to ask you if the headlines about the logistical obstacles for oral antivirals, how accurate are they? And if they are, how are you working through them? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. I appreciate the question, Louise. So, if you look at the situation, and I think you\u2019re probably focused mainly in the United States, we are in a situation where we did deliver to the United States doses of courses of therapy before the end of the year, a little over 900,000 courses of therapy were delivered to them. Since then, we continue to add to that. And by the end of this week, we should be to the full 3.1 million courses delivered to the distribution hubs that they have. Obviously, at that point, it\u2019s us working with the government. But it\u2019s up to the government on where and how they distribute it from the hubs out into the pharmacies and the local markets. I think, the real thing we\u2019re focusing on in discussions with the government is how do we increase the messaging to help people understand how they can find out where they can go to get to antivirals. And there\u2019s locator sites that the government has on the web. And we\u2019re trying to make sure as much as we can to help people know to go look there, because the drug is in the marketplace, you just have to be able to find out where to go find it. And we will continue to partner with the government any way they need to ensure we can get access as quickly and as affordably as possible. Obviously, we\u2019re very focused beyond the U.S. as well, and I feel very good about what we\u2019re doing. You probably saw we announced that we had a deal with UNICEF for 3 million courses. Now, that really us trying to help make sure we could accelerate access to the low and middle income countries as we wait for the generic manufacturers, so we have the licenses with as they ramp up production. So hopefully, that will help fill in the gap in those markets as we wait for the generics to be able to ultimately come on line.\nOperator: Next, we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink.\nDaina Graybosch: I\u2019m going to go back to KEYTRUDA in oncology and IO combination. So, we\u2019re going to see this year, I think, multiple randomized readouts of TIGIT from Roche. And I think as somebody mentioned earlier, you guys have multiple trials of TIGIT and LAG3 coming in the future. I wonder if you could talk to how your development strategy could be differentiating for these IO-IO combinations. In particular, can you highlight anywhere where your base position of KEYTRUDA may give you an advantage?\nDr. Dean Li: Let me take the scientific question in relationship to that. So, thanks for that question. I would emphasize just the general principle that we have, which is we believe that there are ways to improve the immuno-oncology sort of access of PD-1 by adding another checkpoint inhibitor. We believe that that is going to be potentially a different checkpoint inhibitor or a different addition to PD-1, given a different tumor cut. So, we\u2019re not so sure that there is one additional checkpoint inhibitor that you could add to PD-1 that would have as broad of a impact as P1 has itself. So, our strategy has been to invest in CTLA-4, to invest in TIGIT, to invest in LAG3, to invest in ILT4. I think the strategy of some of our other colleagues is to place a larger bet on each of those combinations more broadly. So I think that\u2019s something that I think is really important. The second point that I would also emphasize is you want to show contribution of components. And you want to show that what you\u2019re added on to the PD-1 is really better than the PD-1. And the reason I want to emphasize that is that one should also look at what the base of our PD-1 response is compared to others in relationships. So, it is my belief that targeting the PD-1 axis is, in general, more effective than, for example, a PD-L1. So, that gives us a distinguishing position as well. And then the third issue is, especially in lung, where physicians are very comfortable in relationship of where we stand in relationship with PD-1, with our PD-L1 monotherapy sort of differentiation as well as PD-1 plus chemo in relationship. And also, we\u2019re driving our PD-1 into earlier stages of cancer, for example, in lung and others. I think that gives us sort of a leg up as well. So, three things: One is, how we think strategically about IO-IO combinations; and then, the second sort of thing is, in relationship PD-1 versus a non-PD-1 sort of position, so PD-1 versus a PD-L1; and also, our ability to sort of paint the whole from adjuvant all the way to later stage is something that I think gives physicians enormous comfort in our base drug.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Dean. Thank you, Daina. And thank you all for your good questions today. We realize there is a peer call starting right now, so we want to be mindful of that. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to the IR team at any time, but we appreciate the good questions today and your interest. Thank you.\nRob Davis: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2021 was a year of exceptional performance for our business. We drove robust top line growth of 17% and bottom line growth of 33%. Our teams performed with agility and executed with excellence, despite challenges from the ongoing pandemic. We are also very proud of the significant efforts to bring molnupiravir to patients worldwide. These results reinforce the confidence we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for strong growth. We will continue to invest in our portfolio and pipeline as well as in business development to maximize growth over the near and long term and to create value for patients and shareholders. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.5 billion, an increase of 24% or 23% excluding the impacts of foreign exchange. Molnupiravir contributed $952 million in revenue or 9 percentage points of growth. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum, growing 23%, driven by our key pillars and contribution from molnupiravir. Our Animal Health business also delivered robust performance with sales increasing 8%, driven by companion animal products. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 16% to $4.6 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors and is benefiting from the recent launches in neo-adjuvant and adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and in cervical cancer. KEYTRUDA continues to extend its strong IO class leadership and maintain its position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients, despite competition. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck and RCC. We continue to expand our reach into earlier lines. We were very pleased to receive two additional adjuvant approvals this quarter in RCC and in melanoma. With these approvals, KEYTRUDA has now received 5 indications in earlier-stage cancers. If approved, we also look forward to expanding into adjuvant lung cancer following the encouraging top line results from the KEYNOTE-091 trial. We are confident that along with strong clinical data, KEYTRUDA's reputation and familiarity among physicians will be a benefit as we move into early stage disease. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Growth of 33% was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including prostate. Our expected launch in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial represents a significant opportunity. Lenvima sales grew 31%, driven by RCC and endometrial cancer in the U.S. We have seen very encouraging early trends in new patient share following the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line RCC. We are also excited by the recent launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients and is off to a promising start. We expect to extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our Vaccines portfolio again delivered strong growth, driven by GARDASIL, which grew 50% to $1.5 billion and nearly 40% for the full year. Outside the U.S., he U.S., robust growth was driven by strong underlying demand across all key geographies and particularly China as well as increased supply. This growth more than offset the decline in the U.S. due to timing of CDC purchases as well as the replenishment of the CDC stockpile in the fourth quarter of 2020. Also impacting HPV immunization levels was the prioritization of COVID vaccinations in younger age cohorts. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains strong, as it is increasingly being recognized as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both, females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 24%, driven by increased usage of neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and BRIDION's growing share within the class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales increasing 8%. Companion animal sales increased 26%, driven by global demand in parasiticide, including the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as vaccines. Recall that we experienced changes in distributor purchasing patterns, which negatively impacted last year's results. Livestock sales was flat, as strong global demand for poultry and swine products was offset by a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the recording of an extra month of sales relating to Antelliq in the fourth quarter of 2020. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.8%, a decrease of 0.2 percentage points. As a reminder, we share profits from molnupiravir equally with our partner, Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin. This impact was largely offset by favorable mix and lower discards. Operating expenses increased 3% to $5.3 billion as we continued to invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $50 million. Our full year tax rate was 11.2%, which is lower than our prior guidance due to a more favorable mix of income and expense than previously estimated. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 4.3% reflects the impacts of the lower full year rate as well as foreign tax credit. Taken together, we earned $1.80 per share. It is worth noting that our underlying operating results were towards the upper end of our expectations and the contributions from molnupiravir and the favorable tax rate resulted in EPS that exceeded our price guidance. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. We believe the strong underlying momentum in our business will continue, and we will also benefit from increased molnupiravir revenues. We expect revenue to be between $56.1 billion and $57.6 billion, representing growth of 15% to 18%, including a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 74%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, driven in part by the addition of R&D expenses related to the Acceleron acquisition. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13% and 14%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.12 to $7.27, reflecting growth of 18% to 21%. This range includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1% using mid-January rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on molnupiravir. We are excited by our regulatory authorizations to date and believe molnupiravir will be an important treatment option to combat the ongoing pandemic. We have announced a number of supply and purchase agreements, providing approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Based on agreements now in place, we are confident in our ability to achieve $5 billion to $6 billion in revenues in 2022, weighted to the first half of the year. Next, we expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, which would benefit from increased expansion in ex U.S. market and the continued ramp of recent launches globally. On GARDASIL, we continue to expect robust demand along with increased supply to drive strong year-over-year growth, albeit not at the same pace as in 2021. In the U.S., increased uptake in the mid adult cohort as well as catch up from missed doses due to pandemic will drive growth. Outside the U.S. we continue to expect strong demand across regions, particularly in China and from a relaunch in Japan. Global HPV vaccination levels remain low, and we continue to believe GARDASIL's opportunity for growth is significant. In pneumococcal, we are excited by the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in adults and the potential opportunity for approval in pediatric, which represents a larger portion of the pneumococcal market. We expect some offset however from the impact to U.S. sales of PNEUMOVAX23 as the market continues to shift towards newer pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We also expect to experience modest LOE pressure on JANUVIA in the second half of 2022, as we lose exclusivity in some of the larger ex-U.S. markets. For Animal Health, given our broad and innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to again drive above-market growth in 2022 and beyond. Finally, as we look out to 2025, we remain confident in our ability to achieve strong revenue growth, driven largely by our derisked portfolio and operating margins in excess of 43%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We also continue to augment our internal pipeline through strategic business development. We were active in 2021, including the acquisitions of Acceleron and Pandion, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, our growth in the fourth quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and in the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength. And our continued execution will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. And if I may add, this is Caroline. We have guided to $5 billion to $6 billion of revenue this year. That's on the basis of approximately 10 million courses. To Dean's point, our company remains focused on ensuring there is enough supply depending on how things move forward. So, we are still committed to the 10 million courses we did manufacture in 2021 and more than double that in 2022. So, we will have in excess of 30 million courses to support how the pandemic and how the use of molnupiravir progresses."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. 2021 has been a year of significant achievements and meaningful progress for Merck in the face of what has been a challenging environment for all of us. We delivered on our strategic priorities and took important steps to set a foundation for success in 2022 and beyond. We achieved strong operational performance, accelerated our broad pipeline, including molnupiravir, completed the spin-off of Organon, and acted on key strategic business development activities. We enter 2022 with strong momentum, and are pleased to reflect this in our initial revenue and EPS guidance. We continue to evolve with a more focused, more efficient and faster growing company, with an increased urgency to bring forward innovations to address critical unmet needs. This remains the core of our strategy to benefit the patients we serve, and in turn, create long-term value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. Our business achieved strong revenue and earnings growth. Total revenues increased 24% in the quarter and 17% for the full year. Commercially, we have executed extremely well across all of our key performance drivers, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. We delivered initial molnupiravir shipments to customers around the world, and following the FDA Emergency Use Authorization that was granted in late December, made meaningful progress towards our commitment to the U.S. government. Our dedicated teams worked diligently, including through the holiday season, to deliver 1.4 million courses of therapy to the United States, United Kingdom and other countries by year-end. Throughout 2021, we invested in the discovery, development, production and commercialization of medicines and vaccines, furthering the long-term sustainability of our business, all while delivering meaningful operating leverage and strong EPS growth. In total, 2021 was a year of strong execution of our strategic priorities across all fronts: operationally, commercially, clinically and financially. As we look at 2022 and out to 2025 and beyond, we expect to achieve continued strong growth. Our oncology portfolio will benefit from the uptake of numerous recent approvals and the expected launch of many additional indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Underlying global demand for GARDASIL remains robust, and further growth will be realized through the investments we are making to increase manufacturing capacity. And, our Animal Health business remains very well positioned to grow faster than the market, well into the future. Overall, we expect another year of strong revenue growth in 2022. While we will continue to make investments in our pipeline, we are confident that we can achieve a leveraged P&L and significant long-term operating margin expansion. Longer term, we are intensely focused on successfully navigating the headwind created by likely biosimilar competition to KEYTRUDA at the end of the decade. We aspire to grow through and beyond this period. But, at the very least, we will look to minimize the headwind and shorten the time it takes to return to strong growth. We have multiple levers to achieve this task, driving sustained growth well into the next decade. First, we intend to strengthen our leadership in oncology broadly and leverage that position for sustained long-term success. We've done an excellent job of establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundational therapy, and we intend to maximize its opportunity and patient impact. In addition, we have an expanding portfolio of commercial and developmental oncology assets beyond KEYTRUDA, which offer meaningful growth opportunities beyond 2028. Second, we have many important franchises beyond oncology that we expect can drive durable growth into the next decade, including GARDASIL, which we believe can potentially double by 2030, as well as our pneumococcal portfolio and our Animal Health business, to name a few. Third, we expect to generate very strong cash flow, which we intend to deploy into value-enhancing business development to augment our pipeline and bring additional drivers of longer-term growth. And fourth, we will advance our internal pipeline and the opportunities we see in vaccines, cardiometabolic, neuroscience and other disease areas. We are making extensive investments in discovery research as well, which we believe will be the source of longer-term innovation. As part of our commitment to provide more transparency into these efforts, we will host an investor event focused on our cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline in the spring. In addition to accelerating our internal pipeline, as I noted, a key part of our strategy will be to deploy our cash flow towards the value-enhancing business development. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in pursuing compelling external innovation. And we will supplement our pipeline with an approach that is science-led, but portfolio informed. Last year's acquisitions of Pandion and Acceleron are good examples of our approach. We are taking calculated risks and we'll continue to focus on creating value in areas of unmet need. We have the operational capabilities, financial capacity, scientific prowess and sufficient runway before the end of the decade for business development to play an important role in our goal of achieving long-term sustainable growth. While we have a strong track record of business development, we know we need to do more. Finally, we've taken further steps to integrate important environmental, social and governance goals into the core of our business. In December, we completed the inaugural issuance of a $1 billion sustainability bond. We intend to use the net proceeds to support projects and partnerships in the Company's priority ESG areas and to contribute to the advancement of the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals. We've also acted to accelerate global access for molnupiravir through our groundbreaking access strategy, including a recent agreement with UNICEF for up to 3 million courses of therapy to supplement supply available for distribution in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, this morning, we announced plans to host our initial ESG investor event on February 23rd. We believe that strong performance across key ESG metrics aligns well with Merck's core values and mission. And we look forward to providing insights into our commitment to this space. Now, before I turn the call over to Caroline, I want to take a moment to recognize Frank Clyburn. Following 14 years of significant contributions, Frank will be leaving Merck to become CEO of IFF. I want to thank Frank for the strategic vision and operational excellence he's provided in helping establish Merck as a global leader in oncology and for his strong leadership of our Human Health business. We wish Frank and his family all the best as he embarks on his new endeavor. While Frank will be missed, we are well positioned to continue our strong momentum with the deep and talented team we have in place, and we expect to announce new leader shortly. With that, I'll pass it over to Caroline to provide details into the performance of our business as well as our financial results and outlook. Caroline? Yes, Geoff. Thanks for the question. So, as we look at molnupiravir, we're obviously -- you heard from Caroline, the guidance we're giving for this year, but I think you've hit upon an important point, which we do see the potential for molnupiravir beyond the current situation with COVID-19 and the pandemic, given the fact that it does have such good activity more broadly in mRNA viruses, and as we believe, it can be pan-coronavirus effective. And as we showed recently with six preclinical studies, working well against the Omicron variant, and we believe we'll continue to work against future variants. But maybe I'll turn it over to Dean to expand upon what we're thinking about from a developmental perspective for longer term. Yes. And maybe, Chris, just to answer the first part of your question, how are we seeing the adjuvant space? Obviously, we are very excited about moving into earlier lines of therapy. We think this is a real area of growth. Obviously, the strength we're seeing in KEYTRUDA is about how we're able to expand into new indications and continue to broaden. If you look, we had just in 2021 alone 21 approvals of new or expanded indications for KEYTRUDA. Three of those were in the adjuvant space, with adjuvant, triple-negative breast cancer, adjuvant renal cell carcinoma and moving into a stage 2 cancer in adjuvant melanoma. So, important growth there. And if you look at that combined with the remaining other indications we already have and the other ones in adjuvant mel and what we hope to have soon with KEYNOTE-091 in adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer, we're looking at movement into the earlier spaces, driving approximately 50% of the growth for the drug for KEYTRUDA through 2025. And we think by 2025, it will be about 30% of our total revenue coming from the adjuvant indications we have. So, this is an area where we're starting to put runs on the board. And I think we're going to show that the breadth of what KEYTRUDA could do both in maintenance as well as in the metastatic space is going to be very important as we build the leadership for the long term. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mara. So, as you pointed out, we are seeing in the biotech space, valuations have pulled back quite a bit of late. I think it's too early to see whether or not this is a permanent rebasing in the market or if it is just a temporary change in the marketplace. We need to see how that plays out. And the other thing that's going to be important is what happens with the investment flows into the space. You are seeing IPOs start to slow. And it would be interesting to see if cash investments start to also slow down as people look to invest into the space with a lower valuation in the market, as you point out. Whether or not that drives to sellers being willing to see the restatement of value that will allow us to do deals at different levels, we'll have to see. But it doesn't change the importance we see of doing business development for the Company. Obviously, we're very focused, first and foremost, on driving and accelerating our own pipeline, but we know we have to augment it. And we are going to continue to focus in this area, and I'm confident that we're going to find the opportunities where the scientific opportunity match to our capabilities and where we see good value, will allow us to do value-enhancing deals regardless of the market situation. Yes. So, obviously, we're very excited about what VAXNEUVANCE, the opportunity that this presents, starting with, as you point out, the adult indication, which we received. And as you probably know, we did do the MMWR come out and validate the ACIP recommendation. So we're at a point now where reimbursement is established in the marketplace, and we are beginning to ship product. As we look at this, we see a real opportunity, because if we look at what is the profile of VAXNEUVANCE in combination with PNEUMOVAX23, you're looking at an agent that has the broadest coverage. Between the two, we have 15 serotypes in VAXNEUVANCE. We're adding 9 additional serotypes, 4 which are unique to PNEUMOVAX23. And as we look at the coverage, obviously, in things like serotype 3, we showed with VAXNEUVANCE that we are very competitive, if not superior to competition in the marketplace. And we know that serotype 3 is an important contributor and driver of disease, as is serotypes 22F and 33F, which are in ours as well. So, as we look at it, you've got very broad coverage. You've got important coverage in high disease-causing serotypes. And we have important data showing how the drug works in at-risk and immunocompromised patients, which will be in the label -- is in the label. So, we're well positioned. We're going to have to obviously fight it out at the commercial level, but we think we're well positioned to do that. And we already are starting to look forward to what we see in the pediatric space. Right now, hopefully, we're going to see -- with the PDUFA in April, we're going to see hopefully the opportunity to get that drug into the marketplace. But obviously, we're going to build on the momentum from the launch in adults to then carry that forward into the pediatric setting. So, so far, all started well, good contracting underway, and we're off to a good start. Thanks. Yes. I appreciate the question, Louise. So, if you look at the situation, and I think you're probably focused mainly in the United States, we are in a situation where we did deliver to the United States doses of courses of therapy before the end of the year, a little over 900,000 courses of therapy were delivered to them. Since then, we continue to add to that. And by the end of this week, we should be to the full 3.1 million courses delivered to the distribution hubs that they have. Obviously, at that point, it's us working with the government. But it's up to the government on where and how they distribute it from the hubs out into the pharmacies and the local markets. I think, the real thing we're focusing on in discussions with the government is how do we increase the messaging to help people understand how they can find out where they can go to get to antivirals. And there's locator sites that the government has on the web. And we're trying to make sure as much as we can to help people know to go look there, because the drug is in the marketplace, you just have to be able to find out where to go find it. And we will continue to partner with the government any way they need to ensure we can get access as quickly and as affordably as possible. Obviously, we're very focused beyond the U.S. as well, and I feel very good about what we're doing. You probably saw we announced that we had a deal with UNICEF for 3 million courses. Now, that really us trying to help make sure we could accelerate access to the low and middle income countries as we wait for the generic manufacturers, so we have the licenses with as they ramp up production. So hopefully, that will help fill in the gap in those markets as we wait for the generics to be able to ultimately come on line. Thank you."

            "name": "Dr. Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. I will provide a brief summary of notable achievements in 2021 and then report on progress since the last earnings call. In 2021, we made meaningful advancements across our broader pipeline with approvals for new molecular entities, including VAXNEUVANCE, Verquvo and WELIREG, and an EUA for molnupiravir. We also made strides in women's cancers with U.S. regulatory approvals for KEYTRUDA in cervical, endometrial and triple-negative breast cancer. In total, we received more than 30 approvals and filed more than 20 NDAs and sBLAs in the United States, EU, Japan and China. In 2022, we look to build on this progress and momentum. I will now cover notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates for our molnupiravir, oncology, pneumococcal, HIV and cardiovascular programs. As we enter the third year of the pandemic, the Omicron variant continues to wreak havoc on our communities and health care systems. In the United States alone, we are now seeing approximately 2,000 deaths a day. Vaccines and treatment options have the potential to help combat this pandemic. Since the first authorization for molnupiravir by the UK in November, we have received authorizations in 9 additional countries, including an Emergency Use Authorization in the United States and a special approval for emergency in Japan. In addition, other countries have provided authorizations to our voluntary license holders. Findings from the MOVe-OUT clinical trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the end of last year showed molnupiravir significantly reduced hospitalization or death in adult patients most in danger of progressing to severe disease. Importantly, for physicians and patients, approximately 90% fewer deaths were seen in those taking molnupiravir. These results reinforce that molnupiravir can provide an important oral treatment option for certain adults at high risk for severe illnesses. The Director of the United States CDC has indicated the need to prioritize therapeutic interventions for people with the highest risk of progression, such as those with certain comorbidities. We believe molnupiravir's low propensity for drug-drug interactions make it a meaningful and important option for appropriate patients with COVID-19 who are receiving treatments for underlying conditions, such as heart disease, hypertension and diabetes, and for those with impaired liver or kidney function, consistent with local recommendations. To date, this pandemic has consisted of successive waves of SARS-CoV2 variants, most recently, Omicron. Last week, we announced data from multiple independent studies indicating that molnupiravir is active against the Omicron variant in vitro. Each surge comes with distinct public health and disease characteristics and corresponding treatment and prevention challenges. The potential threat of rapidly emerging variants reinforces the need for treatment options with high barrier to resistance that target evolutionarily conserved aspects of viral biology. Recognizing the importance of an oral antiviral, we committed to manufacturing molnupiravir and have it ready for supply to patients within the U.S. upon emergency use authorization. As Caroline noted, we were able to fulfill that promise and ensure delivery of this important treatment. We are working with governments and partners around the globe to stay ahead of the curve and to further Merck's contribution in fighting this pandemic. Next, we continue to fortify our position in oncology. Several recent milestones highlight our strategy of targeting earlier-stage cancers where there is potential for improved outcomes by reducing risk of recurrence. We received FDA and European Commission approval for KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for renal cell carcinoma and FDA approval for certain stages of melanoma. In RCC, approval was based on KEYNOTE-564. KEYTRUDA is the first and only immunotherapy treatment option for certain patients at intermediate, high or high risk of recurrence in the adjuvant setting. And in melanoma, the approval was based on KEYNOTE-716 and provides for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with stage IIB and IIC disease, following complete resection. Both approvals provide patients with important new options shown to help reduce the risk of recurrence. Similarly, we recently announced a positive finding from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARLS study, evaluating KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection. At an interim analysis, the trial met one of its dual primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in disease-free survival in all comers when treated with KEYTRUDA compared to placebo. The trial will continue to analyze DFS in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, the other dual primary endpoint, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis, as well as overall survival, a key secondary endpoint. We are continuing to make progress in women's cancer based on data from the Phase 3 OlympiA trial. The FDA granted priority review for Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of patients with BRCA-mutated HER2-negative, high-risk early breast cancer, previously treated with chemotherapy, either before or after surgery. We anticipate FDA action during the first quarter of 2022. Moving to the broader portfolio. The FDA issued a complete response letter for the new drug applications for gefapixant and have requested additional information related to the measurement of efficacy. There were no safety concerns for gefapixant. And we will continue with the FDA to discuss next steps as we look to address the significant unmet need in patients with chronic cough. In Japan, we are pleased to announce the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved LYFNUA, the trademark for gefapixant for adults with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Momentum continues in our pneumococcal disease program, following the U.S. approval in July 2021, the European Commission VAXNEUVANCE in individuals 18 years of age and older in December. Also in December, we announced the FDA granted priority review of our supplemental application for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting. Importantly, VAXNEUVANCE incorporates serotypes 22F and 33F up and provides robust response on other key disease-causing serotypes, like serotype 3, therefore, offering the potential to prevent additional invasive disease in children. We anticipate regulatory action in the spring of this year. Merck has a proud legacy of HIV research, and we remain committed to those impacted by this virus. Following the announcement of the FDA clinical hold for ongoing trials evaluating islatravir, we are working to understand the data and the principles of the finding. We believe in the potential of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase and translocation inhibitor mechanism for both the prevention and treatment of HIV. And we intend to share updates in the future. Looking across our broader pipeline. As Rob noted, in the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Acceleron. Its lead candidate, sotatercept, is an excellent complement to our pipeline and has the potential to provide a novel approach to treating pulmonary arterial hypertension. The integration is proceeding according to plan, and the Phase 3 program is on track. We plan to provide further details on our cardiovascular pipeline at an investor event in the spring. In closing, 2021 was a tremendous year where we demonstrated our ability to advance both our internal and external pipelines. We are well positioned to continue our momentum into 2022, with a dual focus: becoming the leading oncology company by 2025 and sustaining that position beyond 2028, while also extending our impact across other therapeutic areas. I look forward to providing further updates in the coming year. Now, I turn the call back to Peter. Yes. So, if I may, let's just frame how many deaths we have a day in the United States. I mean, it's quite staggering where we are at this point. Now, I would just emphasize molnupiravir is an oral drug as all know. It's effective in reducing hospitalization and death. And I really think when we think about the death rate in the United States and throughout, having access to medicines that can reduce mortality greater than 80%, 85%, 90% is going to be really important. And molnupiravir is one of such drugs that can do that. And I think that needs to be sort of emphasized throughout. Now, in relationship to molnupiravir directly, those people who we have to be concerned about drug-drug interactions or renal insufficiency or liver insufficiency are often those people at the highest risk. And the fact that molnupiravir has a profile that is really useful in those patients is important. I do want to emphasize that by first principle, the whole mechanism and the molecule is designed to be as variant proof as can be theoretically possible. And what we've seen with the Omicron and potentially what we will see with other variants is that theoretical becomes real. With Omicron, for example, all of a sudden, there's a series of antibody treatments that are no longer effective. And then the other point that I would make is, when we sent our EUA in October, we also held hands that we would be able to produce, supply, distribute this drug immediately. And I think that's been shown that when we send our EUA in October, we were in that position. And we demonstrated when we got an EUA in late December how fast we could distribute. And I just want to emphasize that I think that when one looks at the death rate when we sent in our EUA and what the death rate now is, it's threefold higher. So, I just want to emphasize that. When you think about the future, I suppose there is different bookends with one can think through. And the different bookends would be, okay, maybe we could get a really lethal sub variant. Then that issue of us having a resistance profile that we're very confident about could be really important. The other possibility of a bookend is that this becomes sort of more endemic. So, it's everyone's getting it. It's not necessarily that lethal for healthy people. But in that situation, like in flu, it is the most vulnerable patients are the ones who need to get treated. And that most vulnerable population are often those people you have to worry about drug-drug interactions, renal and liver insufficiency. So, in that context with just COVID-19, that's how we think about molnupiravir. In relationship to your question about eventually, does the field have to really think about combination? I do think. And I do think it's important that we have an arsenal of multiple mechanism-of-actions, because in every viral disease that I know, the virus is pretty good at evading different mechanisms of action. And I think we may have to think about this combination issue that you've talked about. And we have invested both in internal resources and other mechanisms of action. And we're in conversations with other people with different mechanism of action. So, the fundamental thing is I think we need to have a view that we need to be prepared that we're going to need multiple options, and molnupiravir is an important part of the arsenal that this -- the United States and globally will need to have. Right. So, I just want to emphasize, there are two types of combinations that we have. We have an IO-IO combination, and I think that's what you're referring to, in relationship to KEYTRUDA, whether it's with our TIGIT LAG3, CTLA-4 and that. And you're right, those readouts are event-driven and such. And that will be -- we'll see where it is, but I think your timing is a reasonable sort of timing in terms of Phase 3 readouts. In relationship to other combinations, I want to draw your attention to the combinations of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy, with other ADCs that we've worked with other companies with. But I would also focus your attention also on the readouts of KEYTRUDA with Lenvima, that continue to spool up, [ph] and KEYTRUDA with Lynparza. And the reason why I think that's important is, we think about how to raise the immuno-oncology profile of KEYTRUDA with other I-O agents. But also, as we see Lynparza and Lenvima, they are -- they give us readouts of how to think about DNA repair and recombination in second and third generation of different sort of compounds in that place. And also, in relationship to Lenvima, where you're looking at blocking vascular endothelial growth factor, RTKs, it gives us a thought as to how to think of drugs such as WELIREG, which also plays in that sort of same sort of place. And so, we're very interested in seeing how WELIREG plays out in sporadic renal cell carcinoma. And then, we will ask ourselves outside of renal cell carcinoma where else should it play where an anti-angiogenesis agent has been shown to be effective. Yes. I want to be a little bit careful that I'm answering questions about another company's drug. I think that having monoclonal antibodies that can treat RSV in a really important patient population is critical. We have data that will be coming out, and we'll have to see what that data looks like. But we do think that there is opportunity to have a really effective drug that really is easier to provide to that patient population. So, I'm a little bit hesitant to comment directly. But we are very confident in the profile of our RSV antibody studies, and we will just have to see what the clinical data looks like as the clinical data comes through. Yes. So, let me take that. So, we are evaluating a considerable body of data. You mentioned trends of lymphocytes that have been observed in different trials that we've had. I would point out that our Phase 3 with islatravir doravirine demonstrated the efficacy and just the highly efficacious nature of islatravir in that combination, which is QD. We will have a near-term evaluation of the future options, but we are still very committed to this longer acting sort of point of view as well. So to get to your question, we have data in relationship to QD islatravir, doravirine and it's highly efficacious. We are going to look at the body of data in relationship to are there ways to continue to make that long sort of resident time, be able to have a less frequent either prep or a treatment. And we're evaluating that data as we speak. Yes. Thank you for that question. So the question is about our oral PCSK9 drug. We presented the Phase 1 sort of readouts in relationship to that. The Phase 2 readouts will be very important. As everyone recognizes, cardiovascular risk is just a tremendous risk throughout. It's actually -- you could view it as an epidemic that continues. And there will be two sort of important considerations to take. One is, as we advance the oral PCSK9, the biomarker of reducing LDL is a powerful biomarker that has been established as an important biomarker that has provided a path for registration based on that, even prior to having sort of readouts in terms of cardiovascular outcomes in terms of death and heart patient end points. So, we believe that we're going to have to do both. But we're very eager to see how well this agent works in our Phase 2 trials in driving the levels of LDL down. And that will give us the confidence to really advance this for patients. But again, driving the LDL down will be an important registrational point that has been a path for other drugs as well. But we will also have to do outcome study in addition to that. You broke up just a little bit. In relationship to the mechanism by which the lymphocyte trend that we disclosed is going down, we're looking at the mechanism of action. I would say just two brief points. One is, there's a question of whether or not there are ways to get around it by looking at the dose that was provided. And then, the second sort of question is the mechanism. The mechanism, we're still evaluating. I believe your question was in relationship with mitochondrial toxicity. That does not list as the first place that we would go in relationship to the data that we have right now. But I don't want to rule out anything right now, as we're evaluating all the data as we speak. Let me take the scientific question in relationship to that. So, thanks for that question. I would emphasize just the general principle that we have, which is we believe that there are ways to improve the immuno-oncology sort of access of PD-1 by adding another checkpoint inhibitor. We believe that that is going to be potentially a different checkpoint inhibitor or a different addition to PD-1, given a different tumor cut. So, we're not so sure that there is one additional checkpoint inhibitor that you could add to PD-1 that would have as broad of a impact as P1 has itself. So, our strategy has been to invest in CTLA-4, to invest in TIGIT, to invest in LAG3, to invest in ILT4. I think the strategy of some of our other colleagues is to place a larger bet on each of those combinations more broadly. So I think that's something that I think is really important. The second point that I would also emphasize is you want to show contribution of components. And you want to show that what you're added on to the PD-1 is really better than the PD-1. And the reason I want to emphasize that is that one should also look at what the base of our PD-1 response is compared to others in relationships. So, it is my belief that targeting the PD-1 axis is, in general, more effective than, for example, a PD-L1. So, that gives us a distinguishing position as well. And then the third issue is, especially in lung, where physicians are very comfortable in relationship of where we stand in relationship with PD-1, with our PD-L1 monotherapy sort of differentiation as well as PD-1 plus chemo in relationship. And also, we're driving our PD-1 into earlier stages of cancer, for example, in lung and others. I think that gives us sort of a leg up as well. So, three things: One is, how we think strategically about IO-IO combinations; and then, the second sort of thing is, in relationship PD-1 versus a non-PD-1 sort of position, so PD-1 versus a PD-L1; and also, our ability to sort of paint the whole from adjuvant all the way to later stage is something that I think gives physicians enormous comfort in our base drug."

Q3 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir?\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Grace. Good morning. Welcome to Merck's third quarter 2021 conference call. Speaking on today's call, we will be Rob Davis, Chief Executive Officer. Frank labor and president of human health. Caroline Litchfield and Chief Financial Officer. And Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items.  You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the U.S. Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020, 10K identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning, Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers prepared remarks. The presentation today's earnings release, as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis : Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm very pleased to report significant progress across our key growth and strategic priorities in Merck's first full quarter as a more agile and focused science-driven Company. We have strong momentum in our business. We've achieved notable clinical milestones, acted on a significant business development opportunity consistent with our strategy, and executed commercially to drive strong performance this quarter.  We're also working with diligence and urgency, which is reflected in the speed with which we were able to bring forward our investigational COVID-19 antiviral Molnupiravir and to rapidly file for emergency use authorization with the FDA. It's an exciting time at Merck, and we are determined to build on our recent successes as we pursue our mission to deliver innovations that save and improve lives and as we seek to create long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  Dean will speak to the significant pipeline advancements we are making in a minute. But I first want to congratulate him and our research colleagues, as well as our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on the meaningful clinical results we recently reported regarding the development of Molnupiravir. From the onset of the pandemic, Merck has sought out opportunities to apply its scientific expertise in the global fight against COVID-19, and we are very pleased to now be in a position to make a meaningful difference.  As you are aware, at a planned interim analysis of our Phase 3 trial in at-risk, non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Based on these results, and in consultation with the FDA, we stopped our trial early. We're now working with the FDA as the agency reviews our EUA application and we look forward to next month's advisory committee discussion.  I'm pleased with the progress we're making to enter supply and purchase commitments with numerous governments and healthcare systems around the world and with the success of our efforts to rapidly build supply. I'm also proud that we will be positioned to provide access to patients around the world through voluntary license agreements, tiered pricing based on country affordability, and to our agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool. We've also taken a meaningful step towards augmenting our pipeline through business development, a key strategic priority.  The announced acquisition of Acceleron is a perfect example of our efforts to identify and bringing the strongest external science to supplement our own work. Acceleron's lead product candidate, Sotatercept, has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease.  We look forward to the completion of our tender offer in the near future and to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals that will permit us to close the transaction. With its multi-billion-dollar peak sales potential and commercial exclusivity well into the next decade Sotatercept can contribute meaningful revenue growth in the KEYTRUDA LOE period, an important attribute of this and potential future targets. Dean and I will continue to work with our team to identify additional scientifically compelling business development opportunities, while also continuing to pursue our robust and growing internal pipeline.  Our business performed exceptionally well this quarter and the team continues to display superior and focused execution. We achieved very strong commercial and financial results with meaningful growth across our oncology, vaccines, and animal health businesses, and even greater growth in earnings. As expected, GARDASIL sales were particularly robust as we benefited from the sharp improvement in manufacturing output and availability of more doses to help address ongoing strong underlying demand.  We are confident that the momentum we are seeing will continue through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth over the next several years. We remain focused on our efforts to transform the way we work by evolving our operating model to be leaner, nimbler, and more digital-enabled. My leadership team is fully aligned behind the need for Merck to work with more speed, urgency, and agility across all aspects of our business.  We must stay ahead of the evolving external environment to ensure we are able to make the significant investments required to deliver future innovations that will address unmet medical needs across the globe. In doing so, we aim to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients while continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. Finally, I want to highlight the recent publication of Merck's environmental, social, and governance progress report.  This year's report highlights important updates on metrics and goals around our four ESG priority areas, which include access to health, our employees, including their health and safety, as well as engagement and diversity, environmental sustainability, and ethics and values. These ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission and support our business strategy. We look forward to providing ongoing updates on these important efforts. With that, I will pass it to Frank to review the details behind our human health performance.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter and we achieved 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We have continued to invest with urgency and patient activation programs that improve patient awareness and encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates.  These actions while aimed at benefiting patient health also meaningfully benefited our largely physician administered portfolio in the quarter. In U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures remain at mostly normal levels. In oncology, while screening rates and diagnosis continued to improve, they are unfortunately still below pre - COVID levels. And this is impacting new patient starts. Outside of the U.S., our business performance remains strong despite lingering impacts from the pandemic in certain markets.  Now turning to the Third quarter performance of our key brands, my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 21% to $4.5 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors, including growth from our recent launches, such as KEYNOTE-522, in neo adjuvant - adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer. KEYTRUDA is continuing to extend its very strong overall IO class leadership, improving new and total patient market share.  KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite continued competition. Outside of lung, key tumors contributing to growth include renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast, MSI High, esophageal, and head and neck. We're also excited by the recent approval, an upcoming launch of Keynote 826, which is a first anti PD-1 combination approved as a first-line treatment of cervical cancer. Outside of the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head-neck and renal cell carcinoma.  We are continuing to see the opportunity to expand our reach into earlier lines of therapy materialize. We are very excited about the potential upcoming adjuvant launches of KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-716 in melanoma. In fact, in the U.S. we expect over half of KEYTRUDA's growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 30% of total KEYTRUDA sales by that time. Lynparza sales grew 25% and it remains the leading PARP inhibitor.  Growth was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including ovarian and prostate, and we look forward to the potential launch next year in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial. LENVIMA sales grew 30%. In the U.S., growth was driven by renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. We're seeing very encouraging early trends from the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line renal cell carcinoma.  Outside the U.S., growth is reflective of increased demand following NRDL listing in China in March of this year. We're also excited by the recent approval WELIREG, for patients with certain VHL associated tumors. We've received very positive feedback from scientific leaders, providers, and patients about the benefits of WELIREG, which is off to a promising start and we are hopeful to extend the reach of WELIREG to broader RCC indications in the future.  Our vaccines portfolio continued to deliver strong growth from GARDASIL, which grew 63% to $2 billion, and has grown 35% year-to-date. In the U.S., the increase in year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the timing of CDC purchases, which helped us overcome a below normal back-to-school season. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remained strong and we're seeing some benefits from recovery of missed doses due to the pandemic.  Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by strong under the outline demand in China, as well as increased supply and our ability to reallocate doses. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15% driven by our ability to capture increased market share within the growing neuromuscular blockade reversal class. Turning to our outlook, the robust underlying demand for our products paired with our continued excellent commercial execution gives us confidence in the outlook for our business.  Merck has shown increased urgency and agility across our organization that has resulted in improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. On GARDASIL. We continue to expect robust ex-U.S. demand and increased supply to drive fourth-quarter performance. We expect to see more normal seasonality for GARDASIL with the third quarter reflecting the highest in sales. Our teams have been working to ensure we have the right processes in place to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly COVID variance continue to impact certain geographies.  These dynamics will drive very strong year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the fourth quarter, driven by ex-U.S. markets such as China. Given global HPV vaccination levels remain low, we continue to believe long-term growth opportunity for GARDASIL remains significant. And oncology, we are encouraged by our strong performance throughout the pandemic, with new launches more than offsetting the headwinds seen from reduced new patient starts.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA, and we'd expect to drive sustained growth across key tumor types and in earlier stages of disease. Next, let me provide a few comments on the outlook for Molnupiravir. As Rob mentioned, we are very excited about the potential to offer the first oral treatment option to at risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in an effort to help combat the pandemic.  Merck is committed to providing widespread access to Molnupiravir globally and is implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria. We have announced a number of supply and purchase commitments to date, and we continue to have discussions on similar agreements with customers around the world. We are also encouraged by the recent unanimous vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  Upon adoption, as a final recommendation by the CDC, this sequence would offer patients the broadest coverage with a strong immune response against 0 types responsible for about 2/3 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults. As we think about our pneumococcal portfolio more broadly, we're excited about the potential opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, which represents a larger market segment.  To conclude, there is continued momentum in our business driven by demand and strong commercial execution and we are well-positioned as we move through the end of the year. The growth in the third quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and global demand for innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to driving that growth long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield : Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter. The investments we are making in our strong portfolio and pipeline, as well as in business development, are helping us deliver outstanding near-term performance, while also positioning us to continue to deliver important innovations and long-term value to patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third-quarter results.  Tesla Company revenues was $13.2 billion, an increase of 20% or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, as Human Health business achieved improving momentum, growing 17%. Our animal health business also delivered robust growth with sales increasing 14% driven by strong global demand across both companion animal and livestock. Companion animal sales increased 18% driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of product, as well as companion animal vaccine.  Livestock sales increased 12%, reflecting strong global demand for ruminant and poultry products, including our animal health intelligence products. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, reflecting the favorable effect of product mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 11% to $4.7 billion.  This was driven by investments in our key growth pillars, particularly in supportive returns care activities and in our early and late-stage pipeline, including Molnupiravir. Other expense increased by approximately $200 million, reflecting higher pension settlement costs. The effective tax rate was 13%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points driven by discrete items. Taken together, we earned $1.75 per share, an increase of 26%. Turning now to our 2021 non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic continued to impact many regions around the world, health systems and patients have largely adapted and we assume this trend will continue.  Our guidance assumes the Acceleron transaction will close during the fourth quarter, subject to the successful completion of the tender offer and regulatory approvals. And does not include potential sales or earnings from Molnupiravir. The underlying strength of our business enabled us to narrow and raise our expected revenue range to 47.4 to $47.9 billion, representing growth of 14 to 15%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1.5% using mid-October rates.  Adverse margin is expected to be approximately 76.5%. We continue to expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $450 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We assume 2.5 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are raising and narrowing our EPS range to $5.65 to $5.70, reflecting significant growth of 25% to 26%. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-October rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on, starting with Molnupiravir revenue.  We expect the global opportunity to be approximately $5 billion to $7 billion through 2022 including 0.5 to $1 billion expected to be realized this year. This assumes emergency use authorization in December. As a reminder, we will share any profit equally with our partner Ridgeback. Market responsible for recording global revenues and costs and will reflect the profit share with same cost of sales. For GARDASIL, we have had excellent momentum, driven by strong demand and benefits from the step function increase in supply we are achieving this year.  Fourth quarter sales will be lower than the third quarter due to normal seasonality and timing effects. However, we expect the growth in the quarter to remain very robust. Animal Health has had exceptional growth in the first three quarters of the year, driven in part by the pandemic effect on pet adoption and pet spending. In the fourth quarter, we will [Indiscernible] as we said, and we expect a more normalized year-over-year growth rate as a result. Our operating margin in the third quarter benefited from very strong revenue performance, including the normal seasonality of our vaccine business.  As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect operating margins to normalize due to this seasonality and phasing of spend. More broadly as we look out to 2024, we remain confident in our revenue potential and continue to believe it is underappreciated. And, we remain on track to achieve our 2024 operating margin target of greater than 42%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive the many significant net and long-term growth opportunities we see in our safe risk portfolio and rich pipeline. We also continue to execute on our business development strategy, including our announced acquisition of Acceleron.  We will pursue additional value enhancing and strategic business development opportunity. And we retained significant Balance Sheet capacity to do so. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, Merck continues to make exceptional progress on its commitment to drive growth and value for patients and shareholders. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength, which will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral anti-viral candidate Molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisition, spotlight some recent progress with [Indiscernible] and finish with this synopsis of notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates from across the pipe block. The need for additional treatment options remains key and combating the COVID-19 pandemic.  Interim analysis from MOVe-OUT, our Phase 3 study evaluating Molnupiravir and at-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo. [Indiscernible] grew day 29, no deaths were reported and patients who received Molnupiravir compared to 8 deaths on placebo. This is the first oral antiviral for respiratory virus to demonstrate benefit based on robust clinical outcome and the first to show a meaningful five-day window for therapeutic intervention after symptom onset.  Based on these positive results and as the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee and in consultation with the FDA, recruitment into the study was stopped early. In light of these findings and given the urgency to address the pandemic, our teams work tirelessly to submit a robust package to the FDA for EUA within 10 days of receiving data. We look forward to discussing the EUA submission at an upcoming meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committees scheduled for November 30th and [Indiscernible] Korlym, we continue to engage with the FDA to support its review.  Applications have also been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies around the world. I do wish to take a moment to thank the investigators, patients, and their families for their participation in the move-out study. I'm also grateful to our collaborators at Emory University Ridgeback, and Merck's internal teams with incredible work done in conducting this program during a very challenging time. A comprehensive vaccination strategy remains the best sustainable means to confront this COVID-19 pandemic.  Timely intervention following symptoms onset with an oral agent that can be self-administered at home may provide an additional meaningful option for patients, healthcare systems, and public health, which could make a significant and positive impact on the pandemic. Based on available viral sequence data, Molnupiravir showed consistent efficacy against the Gamma, Delta, and new COVID-19 variants. As a reminder, we continue to actively recruit participants in the MOVe-AHEAD trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households as a post-exposure prophylactic with a planned readout in the spring of 2022.  Now, turning to the proposed Acceleron acquisition. Acceleron has an excellent scientific category, which had yielded an important treatment for Anemia and adult patients with certain rare blood disorder. Their lead clinical candidate [Indiscernible] has the potential to be a foundational asset as an add-on therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a complementary addition to our growing cardiovascular pipeline. As such, following the close of the deal, our strategy would be to advance the wide-ranging Phase 3 clinical program.  Now onto the portfolio and pipeline starting with HIV. We continued to generate clinical data that reinforces the foundational potential is it's [Indiscernible] in HIV. At the European aids Conference in London this week, we presented data from the Phase II study evaluating the [Indiscernible] in previously untreated adults with HIV infections, which demonstrated continued maintenance of viral suppression through 144 weeks.  We also recently reported positive top-line results from two pivotal trials evaluating a once-daily oral regimen of [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible], and a switch setting, and adults with HIV infection who are virologically suppressed on other HIV therapy regimen. At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint for percentage of the participants with levels of HIV RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per milliliter, demonstrating comparable efficacy with those receiving the comparator antiretroviral therapy.  We plan to present these findings in an upcoming medical congress and incorporate the data into global regulatory of medicine. This week we also announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating a once weekly oral combination of the launch of beer and Molnupiravir Atlanta cap and people living with HIV who are for logically suppressed on an antiretroviral therapy. We have made great progress in our collaboration with Gilead and look forward to reporting our future development, including our long-acting injectable coal formulation.  Next, onto VAXNEUVANCE. We received a positive opinion for VAXNEUVANCE from the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in individuals 18 years of age and older. And more recently in the US, the CDC's ACIP voted unanimously to provisionally recommend VAXNEUVANCE, followed by PNEUMOVAX as an option for pneumococcal vaccination in adults 65 years and older, as well as for adults aged 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions with both patient population being studied in our clinical trial.  Vaccine performance is multi-dimensional and includes the listening a strong immune response, as well as providing coverage for important disease serotype. Our 2-dose regimen accomplishes the best of both by [Indiscernible] a robust immune response across the 15 sero -types VAXNEUVANCE, including serotype 3 as well as providing the broadest serotype coverage among current pneumococcal vaccine options of which 4 that are unique to PNEUMOVAX. Furthermore, VAXNEUVANCE as the most extensive clinical development program of the newly licensed PPV.  This includes completed or ongoing evaluation among those with certain chronic or an immune compromised conditions that increase affectability too, and severity of pneumococcal disease. We also announced positive top-line results for VAXNEUVANCE from the pivotal new [Indiscernible] study, evaluating immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability in the pediatric setting. NF submitted an application to the FDA. Evidence indicates the incorporation of serotypes 22F and 33F, as well as strong immunogenicity against serotype 3, has the potential to play an important role in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children.  These 3 serotypes represent more than a quarter of all cases of invasive disease in children under the age of 5. We will present full results at an upcoming scientific congress. And finally, to oncology. The rich flow of data from our clinical development programs across tumor type continue. We maintain momentum in the development of new treatment options for women's cancer with the approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without Bevacizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on data from KEYNOTE-826. This study showed a meaningful 36% reduction in the risk of death.  This is the first anti-PD-1 combination treatment option for patients in the first-line setting and together with our industry-leading Human Papilloma Virus vaccine, GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, we are uniquely positioned to address certain unmet needs in cervical cancer with a focus on both prevention and treatment. At ESMO in September, we presented final results from KEYNOTE-355, 355, our study of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which showed a reduction in the risk of death by 27%.  KEYTRUDA is the only immuno -oncology agent approved in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This along with additional data presented across endometrial and ovarian cancers reinforces the remarkable progress being made in our broad women's cancer portfolio. We are also making inroads in new cancer types, including prostate cancer. With our partners at AstraZeneca, we announced positive results from the Phase 3 PROpel study for the frontline treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  This study demonstrated the Lynparza in combination with abiraterone significantly delayed disease progression regardless of biomarker status. Lynparza is a first PARR inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit and radio-graphic progression-free survival in combination with a new hormonal agent in this study. We are encouraged by this study and the potential to help the increasing number of men diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities globally.  Next, to renal cell carcinoma, which represents an important area of expansion. In August, we received FDA approval for [Indiscernible] a first-in-class HIF -2alpha inhibitor therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Bon FIFO Lindahl disease who required therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system, and Angio blastoma while pancreatic neuro -endocrine tumor not requiring immediate surgery. This approval provides a beachhead as we evaluate WELIREG potential in broader RCC indications and beyond.  Also, in RCC in partnership with A5, following FDA priority review, we received approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA LENVIMA and the front-line setting based on results from a [Indiscernible] 518 trial. This brings forth an important new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced RCC. We are also rapidly expanding programs into earlier lines of therapy. During the quarter the FDA granted priority review for application for KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RCC at intermediate high or high risk of occurring following the effectively, or following nephrectomy in resection metastatic regions from the KEYNOTE-564 studies.  Additionally, we received priority review for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with surgically resected high-risk stage 2 melanoma, based on results from the KEYNOTE-716 studies that showed an improvement in recurrent pre -survival compared to placebo. Both of these studies demonstrate the benefit of expanding the use of KEYTRUDA to earlier stages of disease, allowing us to extend treatment benefits to more patients sooner. We look forward to decision on both studies by the end of the year. To conclude, I am proud of the progress across our broad pipeline, and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future. Now, I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Grace, can you please start the Q&A portion of the call?\nOperator: Absolutely.\nPeter Dannenbaum : And I'd like to ask the questioners to limit themselves to one question today in order to get to as many different questions as possible.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Umer Raffat of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nUmer Raffat : So, I will just ask on KEYTRUDA and adjuvant lung instead. Have you had an interim and does the stat plan allow for hierarchy where PD - L1 positives is first, and do you expect the benefit to show in patients that did and did not get adjuvant chemo? Thank you very much.\nDean Li : Yes, thank you very much. I appreciate the question. First, I get want to elevate for just a second, we are excited by the emerging data, the role of PD-1 and PD - L1 in the early treatment in adjuvant space. For us, we are gratified that in renal melanoma, breast cancer is just [Indiscernible], there appears to be great effect and these are cancers where there are frequently employed methods for early screening.  In relationship to lung specifically, we enjoy a dominant position in lung cancer and in lung cancer, the treatment of latter stage cancer is the predominant stage. As the data and you somewhat alluded to from other companies indicate that in lung cancer, the PD-1, PD - L1 class could be effective in early and adjuvant. In specific and relationship to, then we have a number of early and adjuvant stage lung cancers, and it was a [numerated then applied] (ph).  KEYNOTE-091 is also known as the PEARLS trial. KEYNOTE-091 PEARLS is a collaborative study with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Merck is a collaborator on this trial. This is an event-driven study and we are in active communication with EORTC, and together, we are awaiting data from the [Indiscernible] before the end of the year. And I would hazard a guess that any public announcement from Merck would be announced at the beginning of the New Year.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you. Umer. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink, your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch : Hi, kind of maybe a 2-part question on Molnupiravir and how you're moving forward. The first is there's been some concerns publicly about the genotoxicity and I wonder if you could address the data you have that makes you not concerned about that and then the second concern is maybe with resistance and I wonder how you're thinking about the future and combinations and whether that will be needed to prevent any resistance, maybe from low compliance to Molnupiravir?\nDean Li : Yes. Thank you for that question. This is Dean. I would just emphasize we are very confident in the safety profile of Molnupiravir based on our pre -clinical and clinical data. In relationship to the clinical data, I think most people recognize that in the interim analysis, we had a profound reduction in hospitalization and death -- or death compared to placebo. It was stopped early in -- by the guidance of the DSMB and in consultation with the FDA.  In that interim analysis, the inter -- the incidents of any adverse effect was comparable in both Molnupiravir and placebo. And actually, if you look, there were fewer subjects in the Molnupiravir group who discontinue therapy due to an adverse event compared with the placebo group. In relationship to our confidence in the safety profile based on our extensive pre -clinical evaluation I think it's important to recognize that Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue that functions by creating [errors] (ph) in the genetic material of RNA viruses.  These nucleoside analogue are often used in many other antiviral treatments, including HIV and hepatitis. And we have done a comprehensive non-clinical program to characterize the safety profile of Molnupiravir. It's been written by other people. It's actually been written into scientific journals as well, and we will be presenting all of this data I believe in the AdCom that the FDA will be holding.  But, probably the most important pieces of information is that 2 distinct in vivo rodent mutagenicity assays, commonly called the Big Blue and the Big A, which are well-characterized and considered to provide a robust measure of the ability of a drug or chemical to induce mutations in vivo, in these studies we're administering Molnupiravir for longer and higher doses than those employed in the human clinical trial, and the totality of the data from these studies indicate that Molnupiravir is not mutagenic or genotoxic in these in vivo mammalian systems. Now, we have shared these results throughout with the regulatory agencies worldwide, and will continue to provide additional data as this process continues.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Daina. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum : Questions for Frank on Molnupiravir. Just in relation to supply, it strikes me given some of the published improvements in manufacturing and full gram per patient dose. The 20 million looks like a very conservative estimate, given particularly the inclusion of third parties, what could be achieved given the dosing and the API. I'd like a comment, please, on where you think the 2022 real supply could be and second, perhaps you could just comment on the appetite of Merck to use direct-to-consumer advertising or other promotion on Molnupiravir. I understand that promotion and advertising is allowed under an EUA, if you could confirm or deny that would be great. Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn : Hey, Andrew, this is Frank. So, a couple of things that I want to highlight is first, we have a line-of-sight and we will produce 10 million of course this year, Andrew, in 2021. And as we have mentioned that we have line of sight and we will at a minimum double that in 2022. So, to your question, no, we're going to do everything we can to increase the supply for this product. In addition, we have voluntary license partners, you have seen, and we also have a number of partners that we're working with to provide global supply.  So, rest assured, Andrew, we're going to try to do everything on the supply front. On direct-to-consumer -- I think it's a little bit early for us on that. We have not made a decision around that. We are really focused on doing everything we can to sign up agreements with governments, get the product available globally. And we'll be providing additional information as we go forward, on Molnupiravir, but this is our number 1 priority for the Company and it's something that we're really looking forward to trying to help address the pandemic going forward.\nRob Davis : Andrew, this is Rob and I just want to make sure because as I listen to your question, I think Frank hit it but just to emphasize in case others on the phone aren't catching this, the 20 million [Indiscernible] more than doubling what we can do next year. That is Merck's production. We are not including in any of those numbers the 8 voluntary licensed partners in India, nor anyone who the Medicines Patent Pool signs up. So obviously, global production of Molnupiravir will be significantly more next year, we were just speaking to what volumes we will produce within Merck.\nDean Li : Let me just add one thing because I recognize that this question is also somewhat linked to the other question that -- and it relates to how we think about Molnupiravir scientifically in the pandemic's phase, and there's going to be an endemic phase. And potentially, there could be other phases after that. But for the pandemic phase, I just want to emphasize we have the move out trial, and then we'll have to see the potential in the move ahead to see whether we both have a treatment and a prophylaxis.  In the endemic phase, when the pandemic and what received, it's highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic infection, and we all have to recognize and that's related to the previous question during this phase, there will be a large reservoir of individual across the globe, with high copy numbers of virus -- viruses in many of these individuals that may lead to a constant brewing of variants. So, this question of resistance becomes very important. It is important to emphasize that Molnupiravir has an extremely high barrier to resistance. It has broad efficacy across all SARS-CoV-2 variants to-date and in our pre -clinical study and pre -clinical studies of others, it not only has a broad efficacy across SARS-CoV-2 variants, but a broad variety of RNA viruses. And probably the broadest than other -- than all other current mechanisms that we know being developed.  I should emphasize, this high barrier to resistance is critically important, both in the pandemic and the endemic phase, as has been highlighted. And I need to emphasize, for this reason, we prioritized Molnupiravir over other programs, including an internal protease inhibitor given the paramount importance we place on ensuring the highest barrier to resistance, given where we are in the world right now.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. First -- next we have Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould : Hey, guys. I -- good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Unsurprisingly, I'm going to focus on Molnupiravir too. I guess maybe for Frank and Caroline. I'm just trying to understand exactly kind of what's baked into that guidance in terms of what's being distributed for next year between your supply crossing that with the -- to your point, the supplying sort of low and middle-income countries with through the MPP. I acknowledge that there's going to be tiered pricing, but it seems like you'd still becoming far short of distributing your full capacity. So, any color on that front would be helpful.\nFrank Clyburn : Yeah Carter, this is Frank. I'll start and see if Caroline wants to add anything. So, in our assumptions and in -- appreciate this is a very fluid situation. We do assume an early use authorization in December this year, and we are including the contracts that we already have in place as well as those that are underway.  So, we are comfortable with that $5 to $7 billion range through '22. And just to reemphasize, the number's based on the agreements we've signed, those in line of sight, and others that have high probability of execution. Couple of other things is we've mentioned, and Rob reiterated, we will produce 10 million courses of therapy by the end of '21 and are committed to at least doubling that in '22. Our focus initially for important that it's on treatment with COVID-19. You mentioned the broad global access which does come with global tiered pricing around the world.  That's an important aspect, that the pricing will be tiered based on affordability measures. If our post-exposure prophylactic trial is successful as Dean was highlighting with an expected readout in spring, there is potential outside to these estimates. Furthermore, throughout 2022, we do not assume to your question in all of the suppliers use. As such, we have the ability to fulfill additional demand. We also do assume that there will be other oral anti - viral in the market and we'll have to see how that unfolds and we'll look forward to providing you some additional detail and clarity is we want to earn more over the next couple of months.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Carter, next question, please, Grace.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala : Thank you. Merck views its competitive position in Pneumococcal vaccines as strong, but ACIP did not appear to agree, viewing the cost benefit of the 20 valent as superior, even when assuming it was ineffective against 0-type 3. So where does Merck think ACIP errored, and how does Merck change that narrative? Thank you.\nDean Li : First, we're very confident of our V1 for maximum events. There\u2019re 2 places that we're advancing. It's in adult and pediatric. As you know, the pediatric market and I'll let Frank speak to it is quite robust market and we're advancing our program. We have submitted to the FDA, and we hope to hear back from them in short order so we're very focused in the pediatric. In relationship to the adult, the critical issue for us in relationship to GARDASIL is that we -- as I said in the prepared comments,  I think it's very important to give the best coverage in terms of serotypes, but not just by immunogenicity, by actually studying clinical events, especially in those patients who are compromised or at risk or have some other condition that might increase their susceptibility to have invasive pneumococcal disease. And we think that clinical data and the way that we've studied it in these patient populations directly, we have not extrapolated from immunogenicity. We've actually studied it. It's something that's critically important as one looks at the true efficacy about vaccine. Frank, did you want to answer?\nFrank Clyburn : The only thing I'll add is actually we were very pleased that it was unanimous approval for the sequence of that events and PNEUMOVAX.A nd we need to feel as though that the sequence offers patients really with the broadest coverage with strong immune responses against several types that are responsible for 2/3 of Pneumococcal disease in adults, as well as the ACIP did highlight that the regimen was both cost effective as well as cost saving in the 65+ patient population. And then as Dean mentioned, we're also really excited about the opportunity for VAC events in the pediatric segment, which we believe is the larger market opportunity. So overall from our perspective, we feel really good about the ACIP recommendation.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Steve. Next question, please Operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham : Morning, guys. Thank s for the question. You touched on a little bit with Molnupiravir during the first oral, but how do you expect play out commercially versus the booster strategy for vaccines? Would you expect any more formal guidelines from CDC or other [Indiscernible] about how Molnupiravir fits into the algorithm? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn : I'll maybe try this. Geoff, I apologize. You were kind of garbled. I'll repeat what I think your question was, and then you can clarify if I got it wrong. I think your question was, this is the first oral antiviral. But obviously, we continue to have out there vaccines that are important as really the first line, and do we think there is any discussion on how this will fit into the regimen. I don't think we can really comment on how advisory committees, the FDA or others, and the CDC would look at that.  But what I will tell you from our perspective, that first and foremost, people should be vaccinated. That it continues to believe what we think is the right answer. We see our therapy as something that is an important addition to the armamentarium. And obviously, there are places where people cannot get the vaccine or unfortunately as people get vaccinated and have breakthrough virus. So, there's definitely a need for this, but it is in collaboration as a complement to the vaccine and not in place of it. That's our perspective. We'll let the government speak to their own.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great. Thank you, Geoff. Next question, please, Grace.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I'm just trying to get my hands around GARDASIL and the results in the quarter. So, can you clarify or quantify a little bit how much of the $2 billion in sales this quarter was stocking versus underlying demand? And maybe more broadly, are we still in a position where demand is exceeding supply, I guess on a global basis as we think about the recent capacity expansion?  And I guess I'm trying to get my hands around, will there be another step-up in sales for this franchise as we look out to 2023 and beyond with the new facility coming online or is the capacity efforts you've made so far addressing most of the demand that's out there? Thanks so much.\nCaroline Litchfield : So, Chris this is Caroline. I'll start and I'll hand over to Frank. So, in the quarter, as you note, we've had an exceptional quarter and that's driven by strong global demand and the step-up we have in supply. We also did benefit from CDC timing, and that was approximately 125 million of buy-in in the third quarter of this year. And that can trough to a buyout actually, in the third quarter of 2020. So, year-over-year, we feel we've benefited by approximately a 180 million to the results. Now in terms of how we see this going forward, we're very excited about the opportunity, We see opportunity for increased supply through '22 and beyond as we see the other capacity come online, but let me hand over to Frank to talk about the demand that we have.\nFrank Clyburn : Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. A couple of other things that I do want to highlight as you think about GARDASIL, and this is something we've been discussing for a while, is that both the near-term results, as you mentioned, with the long-term prospects. First, I want to highlight that only 9% of the -- we see the eligible cohort globally has been vaccinated. So, Chris, I'll start there and say this, we still have significant opportunity.  And if you think about markets such as China, if you think about the approval in Japan, if you think about the gender-neutral opportunities that we have in Europe, as well as other age cohorts in adult, mid-adult in the U.S. because we feel that there is significant opportunity for continued GARDASIL growth. As you saw, a step-up in our supply, we will continue to see that. It'll be a little bit more modest pace in next year, but rest assured as we bring on the 2 new bulk manufacturing facilities in '23. This is why we feel that the long-term growth prospects for GARDASIL, are very significantly. It'll to be a key growth driver for the Company going forward.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Chris, next question, please. Grace.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson : Thank you. Question on additional M&A. So maybe for Rob. On the Acceleron Investor Clay you held, I asked whether Merck would do more M&A even if it meant taking a rating debt downgrade. And you were very frank in your answer and you said yes. But the Company has not been willing to quantify what debt, additional debt that would potentially be that would trigger downgrade. My understanding is that another $10 billion cash deal would be enough to trigger a one notch downgrade. And if there's something like a $30 billion cash deal, that could be a two-notch downgrade. So, my new question here is, would Merck actually do the deal big enough to cause a two-notch rating downgrade? Thank you.\nRob Davis : I appreciate the question. I would start more high level. Do we continue to pursue additional business development? The answer is yes. It will be driven as it has always been, based on what we see as a compelling scientific opportunity, where we see science addressing an unmet need that is strategically aligned with us and where we can bring value. So that is unchanged. As we look at capacity, I would just say, we believe we have the firepower to do, and frankly, any deal that's out there that we would have strategic interest in doing.  The balance sheet will not be a brake limiter for us; we have very strong balance sheet capacity. I don't think we want to get into trying to get specifics. Some of your numbers frankly, we're quite a bit off actually, but I don't want to start getting into those kinds specifically because it depends on rating agencies that depends on the target. Cash flow is coming from the target. So, with that, I think the important messages, Balance Sheet capacity is not going to build it 100 for us.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Tim, next question, please Grace.\nOperator: Next up we have Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nSeamus Fernandez : Great. Thanks for the question. So just a quick one on the earlier stage pipeline, I'm a little surprised you guys are presenting your first oral PCSK9 inhibitor in a late breaker at AHA in 2 weeks. But it isn't included in your pipeline summary. Could you just help us understand why not? And just as a follow-up to that. When might we hear more about the earlier stage pipeline? Will it be at an R&D day in 2022? What's the right time to start showing a little bit more of the earlier stage pipeline that Merck's been building over the last 3 to 4 years via acquisition and then internally? Thanks.\nRob Davis : This is Rob. Maybe I'll let Dean just comment specifically on the oral CPF, the oral PCSK9 than I can give a comment on the additional transparency question-and-answer.\nDean Li : Specifically in relationship to the PCSK9, it is going to American Heart Association. It is slipping into Phase 2 and that's why we opening our pipeline leave it at Phase 2, but we're trying to demonstrate increased transparency by showing something that's about to enter that, the presentation at the American Heart Association, I think will be well attended.  I think trying to create an oral PCSK9 has been a holy grail in the Cardiovascular field for some time and has not been achieved, and we believe we have achieved it. It is about that product, but it's also about the ability of Merck to do things that other people can't do. And when one looks at how we created that molecule, one can immediately ask yourself, wow, what is their capacity? What's that technology that allows them to do that for PCSK9? What other targets could they be doing as well? Rob?\nRob Davis : Thank you, and as Dean highlighted, we turned our views as things move from Phase 1 into Phase 2. That's when we will start discussing it. So, this is just in that process and I would highlight what Dean did get into, but there's a lot of -- we've other assets and Cardiovascular space that are also either have moved or are moving into Phase 2. That's why we really see our Cardiovascular pipeline as a growing area of excitement and strength and why we were so excited about the complementary nature that Acceleron is to that pipeline.  And as you asked about the transparency, our intention, the next area we'd like to highlight is Cardiovascular, because I can tell you I'm excited about what we have. We've got a lot going on, but I don't think it's appreciated. Obviously, we would like to wait to see the Acceleron deal completed so we can include their assets in that discussion. And that'll come as soon as we can figure out when that will happen, either later this year or early next year. Beyond that, I was very pleased with what we did when we gave added visibility to our HIV pipeline, the excitement we have around [Indiscernible].  That's a foundational drug. oncology continues to have just multiple shots on goal, both with KEYTRUDA and a growing number of new mechanisms. We've highlighted that. And once we get past the Cardiovascular, I assume we will start to talk about our CNS portfolio because we also have a lot in the neurology space. I think it's pretty exciting. So, our view is to do it area by area as things start to move into the space to a realm. And we'll bring it forward as quickly as I can with the Cardiovascular being first once Acceleron has done.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Seamus. It's a little past 9. I think we have time for 1 more question. Next question, please. Grace.\nOperator: All right. Your last question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my question here. So, there are several players trying to bring lower-price checkpoint inhibitors to the market. Do you believe that these discounted pricing strategies will have any traction, why or why not? Thank you.\nFrank Clyburn : Hey Louise, this is Frank. I'll take that from a couple of different angles. I know there's been discussion there and I first want to make sure that we really continue to emphasize that oncology we see, is really data-driven, and the importance of strong clinical data, and I think you have seen that position as well, and also the wall of data that we've established with a product like KEYTRUDA, with 33 indications right now, and just the familiarity and the growth that we're seeing across so many different cancer types that I was highlighting, we feel we're very well-positioned.  We also think that the regulatory hurdle for new entrants increases with additional KEYTRUDA approval., And is positioned to contain you to gain experience. We think that also you would have to have a broader structural change would be required in the U.S. to adopt broadly. So, our view is we'll continue to monitor the competitive landscape as we always do, but we feel very confident in contributed and our growth prospects going forward.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Great, thanks, Louise. Rob, any final points?\nRob Davis : Maybe just a couple of points. First, I want to thank and recognize our Merck employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication. With the pandemic the way we've been able to execute that really. I think shows the best of who we are and I couldn't be more proud across all elements of our business, clinically, commercially, manufacturing, it's really phenomenal, so I do want to first recognize them because I think that's important. And hopefully what you took from the call is this is an exciting time at Merck.  We really have growing momentum and I can tell you growing confidence that we have the ability to grow not only in the near-term, but a growing portfolio of assets that set us up to sustainably be an important contributor to human health and to continue to deliver significant value for our shareholders. We're more focused Company or a faster growing Company. We're working with urgency to achieve our mission and over for patients and shareholders. So hopefully that came through.  And I'm also quite pleased with the amount of progress we've made in a short period of time. You've heard today good developments across businesses, but development, good developments in delivering an incredibly strong quarter, moving fast with what we're doing with Molnupiravir. Great results coming with Islatravir and our broader oncology portfolio. So, we're firing on all cylinders and I am confident and proud of where we are and I thank you for your time\nOperator: Thank you, presenters.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here to provide a summary of progress made since our last quarter call. I will provide an update on our oral anti-viral candidate Molnupiravir, highlight the proposed Acceleron acquisition, spotlight some recent progress with [Indiscernible] and finish with this synopsis of notable regulatory milestones and clinical updates from across the pipe block. The need for additional treatment options remains key and combating the COVID-19 pandemic.  Interim analysis from MOVe-OUT, our Phase 3 study evaluating Molnupiravir and at-risk, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed an approximately 50% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death compared to placebo. [Indiscernible] grew day 29, no deaths were reported and patients who received Molnupiravir compared to 8 deaths on placebo. This is the first oral antiviral for respiratory virus to demonstrate benefit based on robust clinical outcome and the first to show a meaningful five-day window for therapeutic intervention after symptom onset.  Based on these positive results and as the recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee and in consultation with the FDA, recruitment into the study was stopped early. In light of these findings and given the urgency to address the pandemic, our teams work tirelessly to submit a robust package to the FDA for EUA within 10 days of receiving data. We look forward to discussing the EUA submission at an upcoming meeting of the Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committees scheduled for November 30th and [Indiscernible] Korlym, we continue to engage with the FDA to support its review.  Applications have also been submitted to multiple regulatory agencies around the world. I do wish to take a moment to thank the investigators, patients, and their families for their participation in the move-out study. I'm also grateful to our collaborators at Emory University Ridgeback, and Merck's internal teams with incredible work done in conducting this program during a very challenging time. A comprehensive vaccination strategy remains the best sustainable means to confront this COVID-19 pandemic.  Timely intervention following symptoms onset with an oral agent that can be self-administered at home may provide an additional meaningful option for patients, healthcare systems, and public health, which could make a significant and positive impact on the pandemic. Based on available viral sequence data, Molnupiravir showed consistent efficacy against the Gamma, Delta, and new COVID-19 variants. As a reminder, we continue to actively recruit participants in the MOVe-AHEAD trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Molnupiravir in preventing the spread of COVID-19 within households as a post-exposure prophylactic with a planned readout in the spring of 2022.  Now, turning to the proposed Acceleron acquisition. Acceleron has an excellent scientific category, which had yielded an important treatment for Anemia and adult patients with certain rare blood disorder. Their lead clinical candidate [Indiscernible] has the potential to be a foundational asset as an add-on therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and provide a complementary addition to our growing cardiovascular pipeline. As such, following the close of the deal, our strategy would be to advance the wide-ranging Phase 3 clinical program.  Now onto the portfolio and pipeline starting with HIV. We continued to generate clinical data that reinforces the foundational potential is it's [Indiscernible] in HIV. At the European aids Conference in London this week, we presented data from the Phase II study evaluating the [Indiscernible] in previously untreated adults with HIV infections, which demonstrated continued maintenance of viral suppression through 144 weeks.  We also recently reported positive top-line results from two pivotal trials evaluating a once-daily oral regimen of [Indiscernible] and [Indiscernible], and a switch setting, and adults with HIV infection who are virologically suppressed on other HIV therapy regimen. At 48 weeks, both trials met their primary efficacy endpoint for percentage of the participants with levels of HIV RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies per milliliter, demonstrating comparable efficacy with those receiving the comparator antiretroviral therapy.  We plan to present these findings in an upcoming medical congress and incorporate the data into global regulatory of medicine. This week we also announced the start of a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating a once weekly oral combination of the launch of beer and Molnupiravir Atlanta cap and people living with HIV who are for logically suppressed on an antiretroviral therapy. We have made great progress in our collaboration with Gilead and look forward to reporting our future development, including our long-acting injectable coal formulation.  Next, onto VAXNEUVANCE. We received a positive opinion for VAXNEUVANCE from the European Medicine Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in individuals 18 years of age and older. And more recently in the US, the CDC's ACIP voted unanimously to provisionally recommend VAXNEUVANCE, followed by PNEUMOVAX as an option for pneumococcal vaccination in adults 65 years and older, as well as for adults aged 19 to 64 with certain underlying medical conditions with both patient population being studied in our clinical trial.  Vaccine performance is multi-dimensional and includes the listening a strong immune response, as well as providing coverage for important disease serotype. Our 2-dose regimen accomplishes the best of both by [Indiscernible] a robust immune response across the 15 sero -types VAXNEUVANCE, including serotype 3 as well as providing the broadest serotype coverage among current pneumococcal vaccine options of which 4 that are unique to PNEUMOVAX. Furthermore, VAXNEUVANCE as the most extensive clinical development program of the newly licensed PPV.  This includes completed or ongoing evaluation among those with certain chronic or an immune compromised conditions that increase affectability too, and severity of pneumococcal disease. We also announced positive top-line results for VAXNEUVANCE from the pivotal new [Indiscernible] study, evaluating immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability in the pediatric setting. NF submitted an application to the FDA. Evidence indicates the incorporation of serotypes 22F and 33F, as well as strong immunogenicity against serotype 3, has the potential to play an important role in the prevention of pneumococcal disease in infants and children.  These 3 serotypes represent more than a quarter of all cases of invasive disease in children under the age of 5. We will present full results at an upcoming scientific congress. And finally, to oncology. The rich flow of data from our clinical development programs across tumor type continue. We maintain momentum in the development of new treatment options for women's cancer with the approval of KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy with or without Bevacizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer based on data from KEYNOTE-826. This study showed a meaningful 36% reduction in the risk of death.  This is the first anti-PD-1 combination treatment option for patients in the first-line setting and together with our industry-leading Human Papilloma Virus vaccine, GARDASIL and GARDASIL 9, we are uniquely positioned to address certain unmet needs in cervical cancer with a focus on both prevention and treatment. At ESMO in September, we presented final results from KEYNOTE-355, 355, our study of KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast cancer, which showed a reduction in the risk of death by 27%.  KEYTRUDA is the only immuno -oncology agent approved in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. This along with additional data presented across endometrial and ovarian cancers reinforces the remarkable progress being made in our broad women's cancer portfolio. We are also making inroads in new cancer types, including prostate cancer. With our partners at AstraZeneca, we announced positive results from the Phase 3 PROpel study for the frontline treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  This study demonstrated the Lynparza in combination with abiraterone significantly delayed disease progression regardless of biomarker status. Lynparza is a first PARR inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit and radio-graphic progression-free survival in combination with a new hormonal agent in this study. We are encouraged by this study and the potential to help the increasing number of men diagnosed with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities globally.  Next, to renal cell carcinoma, which represents an important area of expansion. In August, we received FDA approval for [Indiscernible] a first-in-class HIF -2alpha inhibitor therapy for the treatment of adult patients with Bon FIFO Lindahl disease who required therapy for associated renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system, and Angio blastoma while pancreatic neuro -endocrine tumor not requiring immediate surgery. This approval provides a beachhead as we evaluate WELIREG potential in broader RCC indications and beyond.  Also, in RCC in partnership with A5, following FDA priority review, we received approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA LENVIMA and the front-line setting based on results from a [Indiscernible] 518 trial. This brings forth an important new first-line treatment option for patients with advanced RCC. We are also rapidly expanding programs into earlier lines of therapy. During the quarter the FDA granted priority review for application for KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant therapy for patients with RCC at intermediate high or high risk of occurring following the effectively, or following nephrectomy in resection metastatic regions from the KEYNOTE-564 studies.  Additionally, we received priority review for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with surgically resected high-risk stage 2 melanoma, based on results from the KEYNOTE-716 studies that showed an improvement in recurrent pre -survival compared to placebo. Both of these studies demonstrate the benefit of expanding the use of KEYTRUDA to earlier stages of disease, allowing us to extend treatment benefits to more patients sooner. We look forward to decision on both studies by the end of the year. To conclude, I am proud of the progress across our broad pipeline, and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific progress in the future. Now, I turn the call back to Peter. Yes, thank you very much. I appreciate the question. First, I get want to elevate for just a second, we are excited by the emerging data, the role of PD-1 and PD - L1 in the early treatment in adjuvant space. For us, we are gratified that in renal melanoma, breast cancer is just [Indiscernible], there appears to be great effect and these are cancers where there are frequently employed methods for early screening.  In relationship to lung specifically, we enjoy a dominant position in lung cancer and in lung cancer, the treatment of latter stage cancer is the predominant stage. As the data and you somewhat alluded to from other companies indicate that in lung cancer, the PD-1, PD - L1 class could be effective in early and adjuvant. In specific and relationship to, then we have a number of early and adjuvant stage lung cancers, and it was a [numerated then applied] (ph).  KEYNOTE-091 is also known as the PEARLS trial. KEYNOTE-091 PEARLS is a collaborative study with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Merck is a collaborator on this trial. This is an event-driven study and we are in active communication with EORTC, and together, we are awaiting data from the [Indiscernible] before the end of the year. And I would hazard a guess that any public announcement from Merck would be announced at the beginning of the New Year. Yes. Thank you for that question. This is Dean. I would just emphasize we are very confident in the safety profile of Molnupiravir based on our pre -clinical and clinical data. In relationship to the clinical data, I think most people recognize that in the interim analysis, we had a profound reduction in hospitalization and death -- or death compared to placebo. It was stopped early in -- by the guidance of the DSMB and in consultation with the FDA.  In that interim analysis, the inter -- the incidents of any adverse effect was comparable in both Molnupiravir and placebo. And actually, if you look, there were fewer subjects in the Molnupiravir group who discontinue therapy due to an adverse event compared with the placebo group. In relationship to our confidence in the safety profile based on our extensive pre -clinical evaluation I think it's important to recognize that Molnupiravir is a nucleoside analogue that functions by creating [errors] (ph) in the genetic material of RNA viruses.  These nucleoside analogue are often used in many other antiviral treatments, including HIV and hepatitis. And we have done a comprehensive non-clinical program to characterize the safety profile of Molnupiravir. It's been written by other people. It's actually been written into scientific journals as well, and we will be presenting all of this data I believe in the AdCom that the FDA will be holding.  But, probably the most important pieces of information is that 2 distinct in vivo rodent mutagenicity assays, commonly called the Big Blue and the Big A, which are well-characterized and considered to provide a robust measure of the ability of a drug or chemical to induce mutations in vivo, in these studies we're administering Molnupiravir for longer and higher doses than those employed in the human clinical trial, and the totality of the data from these studies indicate that Molnupiravir is not mutagenic or genotoxic in these in vivo mammalian systems. Now, we have shared these results throughout with the regulatory agencies worldwide, and will continue to provide additional data as this process continues. Let me just add one thing because I recognize that this question is also somewhat linked to the other question that -- and it relates to how we think about Molnupiravir scientifically in the pandemic's phase, and there's going to be an endemic phase. And potentially, there could be other phases after that. But for the pandemic phase, I just want to emphasize we have the move out trial, and then we'll have to see the potential in the move ahead to see whether we both have a treatment and a prophylaxis.  In the endemic phase, when the pandemic and what received, it's highly likely that SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic infection, and we all have to recognize and that's related to the previous question during this phase, there will be a large reservoir of individual across the globe, with high copy numbers of virus -- viruses in many of these individuals that may lead to a constant brewing of variants. So, this question of resistance becomes very important. It is important to emphasize that Molnupiravir has an extremely high barrier to resistance. It has broad efficacy across all SARS-CoV-2 variants to-date and in our pre -clinical study and pre -clinical studies of others, it not only has a broad efficacy across SARS-CoV-2 variants, but a broad variety of RNA viruses. And probably the broadest than other -- than all other current mechanisms that we know being developed.  I should emphasize, this high barrier to resistance is critically important, both in the pandemic and the endemic phase, as has been highlighted. And I need to emphasize, for this reason, we prioritized Molnupiravir over other programs, including an internal protease inhibitor given the paramount importance we place on ensuring the highest barrier to resistance, given where we are in the world right now. First, we're very confident of our V1 for maximum events. There're 2 places that we're advancing. It's in adult and pediatric. As you know, the pediatric market and I'll let Frank speak to it is quite robust market and we're advancing our program. We have submitted to the FDA, and we hope to hear back from them in short order so we're very focused in the pediatric. In relationship to the adult, the critical issue for us in relationship to GARDASIL is that we -- as I said in the prepared comments,  I think it's very important to give the best coverage in terms of serotypes, but not just by immunogenicity, by actually studying clinical events, especially in those patients who are compromised or at risk or have some other condition that might increase their susceptibility to have invasive pneumococcal disease. And we think that clinical data and the way that we've studied it in these patient populations directly, we have not extrapolated from immunogenicity. We've actually studied it. It's something that's critically important as one looks at the true efficacy about vaccine. Frank, did you want to answer? Specifically in relationship to the PCSK9, it is going to American Heart Association. It is slipping into Phase 2 and that's why we opening our pipeline leave it at Phase 2, but we're trying to demonstrate increased transparency by showing something that's about to enter that, the presentation at the American Heart Association, I think will be well attended.  I think trying to create an oral PCSK9 has been a holy grail in the Cardiovascular field for some time and has not been achieved, and we believe we have achieved it. It is about that product, but it's also about the ability of Merck to do things that other people can't do. And when one looks at how we created that molecule, one can immediately ask yourself, wow, what is their capacity? What's that technology that allows them to do that for PCSK9? What other targets could they be doing as well? Rob?"

            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, the momentum in our Human Health business continued in the third quarter and we achieved 17% growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We have continued to invest with urgency and patient activation programs that improve patient awareness and encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates.  These actions while aimed at benefiting patient health also meaningfully benefited our largely physician administered portfolio in the quarter. In U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures remain at mostly normal levels. In oncology, while screening rates and diagnosis continued to improve, they are unfortunately still below pre - COVID levels. And this is impacting new patient starts. Outside of the U.S., our business performance remains strong despite lingering impacts from the pandemic in certain markets.  Now turning to the Third quarter performance of our key brands, my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 21% to $4.5 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate durable momentum across all key tumors, including growth from our recent launches, such as KEYNOTE-522, in neo adjuvant - adjuvant triple-negative breast cancer. KEYTRUDA is continuing to extend its very strong overall IO class leadership, improving new and total patient market share.  KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients despite continued competition. Outside of lung, key tumors contributing to growth include renal cell carcinoma, triple-negative breast, MSI High, esophageal, and head and neck. We're also excited by the recent approval, an upcoming launch of Keynote 826, which is a first anti PD-1 combination approved as a first-line treatment of cervical cancer. Outside of the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head-neck and renal cell carcinoma.  We are continuing to see the opportunity to expand our reach into earlier lines of therapy materialize. We are very excited about the potential upcoming adjuvant launches of KEYNOTE-564 in renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-716 in melanoma. In fact, in the U.S. we expect over half of KEYTRUDA's growth to come from indications in early-stage treatment settings through 2025 and to represent roughly 30% of total KEYTRUDA sales by that time. Lynparza sales grew 25% and it remains the leading PARP inhibitor.  Growth was driven by our breast cancer indication and continued uptake of the most recent indications, including ovarian and prostate, and we look forward to the potential launch next year in a broader prostate population based on the PROpel trial. LENVIMA sales grew 30%. In the U.S., growth was driven by renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer. We're seeing very encouraging early trends from the launch of KEYNOTE-581 in first-line renal cell carcinoma.  Outside the U.S., growth is reflective of increased demand following NRDL listing in China in March of this year. We're also excited by the recent approval WELIREG, for patients with certain VHL associated tumors. We've received very positive feedback from scientific leaders, providers, and patients about the benefits of WELIREG, which is off to a promising start and we are hopeful to extend the reach of WELIREG to broader RCC indications in the future.  Our vaccines portfolio continued to deliver strong growth from GARDASIL, which grew 63% to $2 billion, and has grown 35% year-to-date. In the U.S., the increase in year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the timing of CDC purchases, which helped us overcome a below normal back-to-school season. Underlying demand for GARDASIL remained strong and we're seeing some benefits from recovery of missed doses due to the pandemic.  Outside of the U.S., growth was largely driven by strong under the outline demand in China, as well as increased supply and our ability to reallocate doses. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 15% driven by our ability to capture increased market share within the growing neuromuscular blockade reversal class. Turning to our outlook, the robust underlying demand for our products paired with our continued excellent commercial execution gives us confidence in the outlook for our business.  Merck has shown increased urgency and agility across our organization that has resulted in improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. On GARDASIL. We continue to expect robust ex-U.S. demand and increased supply to drive fourth-quarter performance. We expect to see more normal seasonality for GARDASIL with the third quarter reflecting the highest in sales. Our teams have been working to ensure we have the right processes in place to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly COVID variance continue to impact certain geographies.  These dynamics will drive very strong year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the fourth quarter, driven by ex-U.S. markets such as China. Given global HPV vaccination levels remain low, we continue to believe long-term growth opportunity for GARDASIL remains significant. And oncology, we are encouraged by our strong performance throughout the pandemic, with new launches more than offsetting the headwinds seen from reduced new patient starts.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and LENVIMA, and we'd expect to drive sustained growth across key tumor types and in earlier stages of disease. Next, let me provide a few comments on the outlook for Molnupiravir. As Rob mentioned, we are very excited about the potential to offer the first oral treatment option to at risk adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 in an effort to help combat the pandemic.  Merck is committed to providing widespread access to Molnupiravir globally and is implementing a tiered pricing approach based on World Bank country income criteria. We have announced a number of supply and purchase commitments to date, and we continue to have discussions on similar agreements with customers around the world. We are also encouraged by the recent unanimous vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  Upon adoption, as a final recommendation by the CDC, this sequence would offer patients the broadest coverage with a strong immune response against 0 types responsible for about 2/3 of invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults. As we think about our pneumococcal portfolio more broadly, we're excited about the potential opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting, which represents a larger market segment.  To conclude, there is continued momentum in our business driven by demand and strong commercial execution and we are well-positioned as we move through the end of the year. The growth in the third quarter underscores our confidence in the underlying strength of our business and global demand for innovative medicines and vaccines, and we look forward to driving that growth long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Hey, Andrew, this is Frank. So, a couple of things that I want to highlight is first, we have a line-of-sight and we will produce 10 million of course this year, Andrew, in 2021. And as we have mentioned that we have line of sight and we will at a minimum double that in 2022. So, to your question, no, we're going to do everything we can to increase the supply for this product. In addition, we have voluntary license partners, you have seen, and we also have a number of partners that we're working with to provide global supply.  So, rest assured, Andrew, we're going to try to do everything on the supply front. On direct-to-consumer -- I think it's a little bit early for us on that. We have not made a decision around that. We are really focused on doing everything we can to sign up agreements with governments, get the product available globally. And we'll be providing additional information as we go forward, on Molnupiravir, but this is our number 1 priority for the Company and it's something that we're really looking forward to trying to help address the pandemic going forward. Yeah Carter, this is Frank. I'll start and see if Caroline wants to add anything. So, in our assumptions and in -- appreciate this is a very fluid situation. We do assume an early use authorization in December this year, and we are including the contracts that we already have in place as well as those that are underway.  So, we are comfortable with that $5 to $7 billion range through '22. And just to reemphasize, the number's based on the agreements we've signed, those in line of sight, and others that have high probability of execution. Couple of other things is we've mentioned, and Rob reiterated, we will produce 10 million courses of therapy by the end of '21 and are committed to at least doubling that in '22. Our focus initially for important that it's on treatment with COVID-19. You mentioned the broad global access which does come with global tiered pricing around the world.  That's an important aspect, that the pricing will be tiered based on affordability measures. If our post-exposure prophylactic trial is successful as Dean was highlighting with an expected readout in spring, there is potential outside to these estimates. Furthermore, throughout 2022, we do not assume to your question in all of the suppliers use. As such, we have the ability to fulfill additional demand. We also do assume that there will be other oral anti - viral in the market and we'll have to see how that unfolds and we'll look forward to providing you some additional detail and clarity is we want to earn more over the next couple of months. The only thing I'll add is actually we were very pleased that it was unanimous approval for the sequence of that events and PNEUMOVAX.A nd we need to feel as though that the sequence offers patients really with the broadest coverage with strong immune responses against several types that are responsible for 2/3 of Pneumococcal disease in adults, as well as the ACIP did highlight that the regimen was both cost effective as well as cost saving in the 65+ patient population. And then as Dean mentioned, we're also really excited about the opportunity for VAC events in the pediatric segment, which we believe is the larger market opportunity. So overall from our perspective, we feel really good about the ACIP recommendation. I'll maybe try this. Geoff, I apologize. You were kind of garbled. I'll repeat what I think your question was, and then you can clarify if I got it wrong. I think your question was, this is the first oral antiviral. But obviously, we continue to have out there vaccines that are important as really the first line, and do we think there is any discussion on how this will fit into the regimen. I don't think we can really comment on how advisory committees, the FDA or others, and the CDC would look at that.  But what I will tell you from our perspective, that first and foremost, people should be vaccinated. That it continues to believe what we think is the right answer. We see our therapy as something that is an important addition to the armamentarium. And obviously, there are places where people cannot get the vaccine or unfortunately as people get vaccinated and have breakthrough virus. So, there's definitely a need for this, but it is in collaboration as a complement to the vaccine and not in place of it. That's our perspective. We'll let the government speak to their own. Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. A couple of other things that I do want to highlight as you think about GARDASIL, and this is something we've been discussing for a while, is that both the near-term results, as you mentioned, with the long-term prospects. First, I want to highlight that only 9% of the -- we see the eligible cohort globally has been vaccinated. So, Chris, I'll start there and say this, we still have significant opportunity.  And if you think about markets such as China, if you think about the approval in Japan, if you think about the gender-neutral opportunities that we have in Europe, as well as other age cohorts in adult, mid-adult in the U.S. because we feel that there is significant opportunity for continued GARDASIL growth. As you saw, a step-up in our supply, we will continue to see that. It'll be a little bit more modest pace in next year, but rest assured as we bring on the 2 new bulk manufacturing facilities in '23. This is why we feel that the long-term growth prospects for GARDASIL, are very significantly. It'll to be a key growth driver for the Company going forward. Hey Louise, this is Frank. I'll take that from a couple of different angles. I know there's been discussion there and I first want to make sure that we really continue to emphasize that oncology we see, is really data-driven, and the importance of strong clinical data, and I think you have seen that position as well, and also the wall of data that we've established with a product like KEYTRUDA, with 33 indications right now, and just the familiarity and the growth that we're seeing across so many different cancer types that I was highlighting, we feel we're very well-positioned.  We also think that the regulatory hurdle for new entrants increases with additional KEYTRUDA approval., And is positioned to contain you to gain experience. We think that also you would have to have a broader structural change would be required in the U.S. to adopt broadly. So, our view is we'll continue to monitor the competitive landscape as we always do, but we feel very confident in contributed and our growth prospects going forward."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our team drove exceptional financial performance in the third quarter. The investments we are making in our strong portfolio and pipeline, as well as in business development, are helping us deliver outstanding near-term performance, while also positioning us to continue to deliver important innovations and long-term value to patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third-quarter results.  Tesla Company revenues was $13.2 billion, an increase of 20% or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. As Frank highlighted, as Human Health business achieved improving momentum, growing 17%. Our animal health business also delivered robust growth with sales increasing 14% driven by strong global demand across both companion animal and livestock. Companion animal sales increased 18% driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of product, as well as companion animal vaccine.  Livestock sales increased 12%, reflecting strong global demand for ruminant and poultry products, including our animal health intelligence products. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.8%, an increase of 0.3 percentage points, reflecting the favorable effect of product mix, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 11% to $4.7 billion.  This was driven by investments in our key growth pillars, particularly in supportive returns care activities and in our early and late-stage pipeline, including Molnupiravir. Other expense increased by approximately $200 million, reflecting higher pension settlement costs. The effective tax rate was 13%, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points driven by discrete items. Taken together, we earned $1.75 per share, an increase of 26%. Turning now to our 2021 non-GAAP guidance. While the pandemic continued to impact many regions around the world, health systems and patients have largely adapted and we assume this trend will continue.  Our guidance assumes the Acceleron transaction will close during the fourth quarter, subject to the successful completion of the tender offer and regulatory approvals. And does not include potential sales or earnings from Molnupiravir. The underlying strength of our business enabled us to narrow and raise our expected revenue range to 47.4 to $47.9 billion, representing growth of 14 to 15%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 1.5% using mid-October rates.  Adverse margin is expected to be approximately 76.5%. We continue to expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate. In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $450 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We assume 2.5 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are raising and narrowing our EPS range to $5.65 to $5.70, reflecting significant growth of 25% to 26%. This range includes a positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-October rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on, starting with Molnupiravir revenue.  We expect the global opportunity to be approximately $5 billion to $7 billion through 2022 including 0.5 to $1 billion expected to be realized this year. This assumes emergency use authorization in December. As a reminder, we will share any profit equally with our partner Ridgeback. Market responsible for recording global revenues and costs and will reflect the profit share with same cost of sales. For GARDASIL, we have had excellent momentum, driven by strong demand and benefits from the step function increase in supply we are achieving this year.  Fourth quarter sales will be lower than the third quarter due to normal seasonality and timing effects. However, we expect the growth in the quarter to remain very robust. Animal Health has had exceptional growth in the first three quarters of the year, driven in part by the pandemic effect on pet adoption and pet spending. In the fourth quarter, we will [Indiscernible] as we said, and we expect a more normalized year-over-year growth rate as a result. Our operating margin in the third quarter benefited from very strong revenue performance, including the normal seasonality of our vaccine business.  As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect operating margins to normalize due to this seasonality and phasing of spend. More broadly as we look out to 2024, we remain confident in our revenue potential and continue to believe it is underappreciated. And, we remain on track to achieve our 2024 operating margin target of greater than 42%. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to invest in the business to drive the many significant net and long-term growth opportunities we see in our safe risk portfolio and rich pipeline. We also continue to execute on our business development strategy, including our announced acquisition of Acceleron.  We will pursue additional value enhancing and strategic business development opportunity. And we retained significant Balance Sheet capacity to do so. We remain committed to the dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, Merck continues to make exceptional progress on its commitment to drive growth and value for patients and shareholders. We remain in a position of financial and operational strength, which will enable us to deliver on that promise now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. So, Chris this is Caroline. I'll start and I'll hand over to Frank. So, in the quarter, as you note, we've had an exceptional quarter and that's driven by strong global demand and the step-up we have in supply. We also did benefit from CDC timing, and that was approximately 125 million of buy-in in the third quarter of this year. And that can trough to a buyout actually, in the third quarter of 2020. So, year-over-year, we feel we've benefited by approximately a 180 million to the results. Now in terms of how we see this going forward, we're very excited about the opportunity, We see opportunity for increased supply through '22 and beyond as we see the other capacity come online, but let me hand over to Frank to talk about the demand that we have."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm very pleased to report significant progress across our key growth and strategic priorities in Merck's first full quarter as a more agile and focused science-driven Company. We have strong momentum in our business. We've achieved notable clinical milestones, acted on a significant business development opportunity consistent with our strategy, and executed commercially to drive strong performance this quarter.  We're also working with diligence and urgency, which is reflected in the speed with which we were able to bring forward our investigational COVID-19 antiviral Molnupiravir and to rapidly file for emergency use authorization with the FDA. It's an exciting time at Merck, and we are determined to build on our recent successes as we pursue our mission to deliver innovations that save and improve lives and as we seek to create long-term value for both our patients and our shareholders.  Dean will speak to the significant pipeline advancements we are making in a minute. But I first want to congratulate him and our research colleagues, as well as our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on the meaningful clinical results we recently reported regarding the development of Molnupiravir. From the onset of the pandemic, Merck has sought out opportunities to apply its scientific expertise in the global fight against COVID-19, and we are very pleased to now be in a position to make a meaningful difference.  As you are aware, at a planned interim analysis of our Phase 3 trial in at-risk, non-hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, Molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by approximately 50% compared with placebo. Based on these results, and in consultation with the FDA, we stopped our trial early. We're now working with the FDA as the agency reviews our EUA application and we look forward to next month's advisory committee discussion.  I'm pleased with the progress we're making to enter supply and purchase commitments with numerous governments and healthcare systems around the world and with the success of our efforts to rapidly build supply. I'm also proud that we will be positioned to provide access to patients around the world through voluntary license agreements, tiered pricing based on country affordability, and to our agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool. We've also taken a meaningful step towards augmenting our pipeline through business development, a key strategic priority.  The announced acquisition of Acceleron is a perfect example of our efforts to identify and bringing the strongest external science to supplement our own work. Acceleron's lead product candidate, Sotatercept, has the potential to become foundational as an add-on therapy in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension where there is a strong need for a new agent that can potentially address the underlying illness and not just the symptoms of this grievous disease.  We look forward to the completion of our tender offer in the near future and to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals that will permit us to close the transaction. With its multi-billion-dollar peak sales potential and commercial exclusivity well into the next decade Sotatercept can contribute meaningful revenue growth in the KEYTRUDA LOE period, an important attribute of this and potential future targets. Dean and I will continue to work with our team to identify additional scientifically compelling business development opportunities, while also continuing to pursue our robust and growing internal pipeline.  Our business performed exceptionally well this quarter and the team continues to display superior and focused execution. We achieved very strong commercial and financial results with meaningful growth across our oncology, vaccines, and animal health businesses, and even greater growth in earnings. As expected, GARDASIL sales were particularly robust as we benefited from the sharp improvement in manufacturing output and availability of more doses to help address ongoing strong underlying demand.  We are confident that the momentum we are seeing will continue through the end of the year, setting us up for continued growth over the next several years. We remain focused on our efforts to transform the way we work by evolving our operating model to be leaner, nimbler, and more digital-enabled. My leadership team is fully aligned behind the need for Merck to work with more speed, urgency, and agility across all aspects of our business.  We must stay ahead of the evolving external environment to ensure we are able to make the significant investments required to deliver future innovations that will address unmet medical needs across the globe. In doing so, we aim to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients while continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for all of our stakeholders. Finally, I want to highlight the recent publication of Merck's environmental, social, and governance progress report.  This year's report highlights important updates on metrics and goals around our four ESG priority areas, which include access to health, our employees, including their health and safety, as well as engagement and diversity, environmental sustainability, and ethics and values. These ESG efforts are grounded in the core values that have always guided our mission and support our business strategy. We look forward to providing ongoing updates on these important efforts. With that, I will pass it to Frank to review the details behind our human health performance. Andrew, this is Rob and I just want to make sure because as I listen to your question, I think Frank hit it but just to emphasize in case others on the phone aren't catching this, the 20 million [Indiscernible] more than doubling what we can do next year. That is Merck's production. We are not including in any of those numbers the 8 voluntary licensed partners in India, nor anyone who the Medicines Patent Pool signs up. So obviously, global production of Molnupiravir will be significantly more next year, we were just speaking to what volumes we will produce within Merck. I appreciate the question. I would start more high level. Do we continue to pursue additional business development? The answer is yes. It will be driven as it has always been, based on what we see as a compelling scientific opportunity, where we see science addressing an unmet need that is strategically aligned with us and where we can bring value. So that is unchanged. As we look at capacity, I would just say, we believe we have the firepower to do, and frankly, any deal that's out there that we would have strategic interest in doing.  The balance sheet will not be a brake limiter for us; we have very strong balance sheet capacity. I don't think we want to get into trying to get specifics. Some of your numbers frankly, we're quite a bit off actually, but I don't want to start getting into those kinds specifically because it depends on rating agencies that depends on the target. Cash flow is coming from the target. So, with that, I think the important messages, Balance Sheet capacity is not going to build it 100 for us. This is Rob. Maybe I'll let Dean just comment specifically on the oral CPF, the oral PCSK9 than I can give a comment on the additional transparency question-and-answer. Thank you, and as Dean highlighted, we turned our views as things move from Phase 1 into Phase 2. That's when we will start discussing it. So, this is just in that process and I would highlight what Dean did get into, but there's a lot of -- we've other assets and Cardiovascular space that are also either have moved or are moving into Phase 2. That's why we really see our Cardiovascular pipeline as a growing area of excitement and strength and why we were so excited about the complementary nature that Acceleron is to that pipeline.  And as you asked about the transparency, our intention, the next area we'd like to highlight is Cardiovascular, because I can tell you I'm excited about what we have. We've got a lot going on, but I don't think it's appreciated. Obviously, we would like to wait to see the Acceleron deal completed so we can include their assets in that discussion. And that'll come as soon as we can figure out when that will happen, either later this year or early next year. Beyond that, I was very pleased with what we did when we gave added visibility to our HIV pipeline, the excitement we have around [Indiscernible].  That's a foundational drug. oncology continues to have just multiple shots on goal, both with KEYTRUDA and a growing number of new mechanisms. We've highlighted that. And once we get past the Cardiovascular, I assume we will start to talk about our CNS portfolio because we also have a lot in the neurology space. I think it's pretty exciting. So, our view is to do it area by area as things start to move into the space to a realm. And we'll bring it forward as quickly as I can with the Cardiovascular being first once Acceleron has done. Maybe just a couple of points. First, I want to thank and recognize our Merck employees across the globe for their hard work and dedication. With the pandemic the way we've been able to execute that really. I think shows the best of who we are and I couldn't be more proud across all elements of our business, clinically, commercially, manufacturing, it's really phenomenal, so I do want to first recognize them because I think that's important. And hopefully what you took from the call is this is an exciting time at Merck.  We really have growing momentum and I can tell you growing confidence that we have the ability to grow not only in the near-term, but a growing portfolio of assets that set us up to sustainably be an important contributor to human health and to continue to deliver significant value for our shareholders. We're more focused Company or a faster growing Company. We're working with urgency to achieve our mission and over for patients and shareholders. So hopefully that came through.  And I'm also quite pleased with the amount of progress we've made in a short period of time. You've heard today good developments across businesses, but development, good developments in delivering an incredibly strong quarter, moving fast with what we're doing with Molnupiravir. Great results coming with Islatravir and our broader oncology portfolio. So, we're firing on all cylinders and I am confident and proud of where we are and I thank you for your time"

Second Quarter 2021 Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Mary, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2021 conference call. With me today are Rob Davis, our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs, Frank Clyburn, President of Human Health, and Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I'd like to point to a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.  I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor Provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020 10-K, identified certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning.  Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings today's earnings release and an Investor Presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on Merck.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. And good morning, everyone. I'm deeply honored to speak to you today in my new role as CEO. Merck is a special Company, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by talented and dedicated colleagues who are intently focused on bringing important life-enhancing and life-saving medicines and vaccines to people and animals around the world.  This longstanding and unwavering commitment to our mission is real, is tangible, and is what drives us to perform every day. The prioritization of investment in research and development under Ken's leadership, and the focus of resources behind key growth drivers, has put us in a position of strength that I intend to build upon.  As I consider Merck's future, I continue to believe investment in the Research and Development, with patients at the center of everything we do, is core to who Merck is, and is our best path to sustainable, ongoing success and value creation.  However, how we go about both delivering the best external and internal scientific opportunities, as well as how we bring those innovations to patients, must evolve. As I transition to the role of CEO, I solicited candid feedback from colleagues and external stakeholders.  What I heard reaffirms my convictions. There's a broad agreement that investment in R&D should remain our highest strategic priority. Employees are confident that we're on the right path. We have rebuilt and reinvigorated our discovery research engine and have a growing and robust pipeline.  We're successfully executing on clinical development And we're delivering strong commercial growth across both our human and animal health businesses now and will continue to do so, well into the future.  While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency, and agility, more closely matching the pace of change in the broader environment. We need to accelerate the delivery of our innovations to the patients who need them, and to be leaner, nimbler, and more digitally-enabled.  We need to leverage the scale and reach we have as a global biopharmaceutical leader, while also embracing in commitment to evolve to address new challenges. And, we need to move with focus and intentionality, which is a priority for both me and my management team.  I know that it's not about promising, it's about performing. Actions speak louder than words. With that understanding, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that Merck remains a global biopharmaceutical leader long into the future, delivering value to current and future patients, and growth and value for our shareholders.  Now, turning to the quarter, we had very good performance with strong growth. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic on our business is lessening. Patient access to healthcare providers has improved, and we expect continued strong growth in the remainder of the year.  We're also making meaningful clinical advancements, which Dean will speak to in just a few moments. Our seamless execution during a period in which we successfully completed a complex spin-off, without business interruption, underwent leadership transitions and delivered accelerated growth only increases my confidence in what our organization can achieve in the future.  Organon is now an independent Company, an important milestone in our Company's history. And this transaction is a meaningful catalyst to Merck becoming a more focused, more efficient, and faster growing Company.  Let me spend a moment speaking about KEYTRUDA, which again experienced very strong growth this quarter. I'm confident that KEYTRUDA will continue to be a foundational cancer therapy and achieve strong growth for years to come. We are a leader in immuno-oncology, and are determined to leverage this into sustained success.  We are rapidly advancing a diverse set of oncology assets, many of which we highlighted in our recent ASCO investor presentation. Across our oncology portfolio, we expect over 90 potential new indications by 2028, more than tripling our current base.  We have a wide array of clinical partnerships, providing valuable insights into the biology of disease and into important potential external innovation. With our expanding oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA, we will extend our leadership in cancer long into the future.  I also strongly believe we will successfully navigate the eventual KEYTRUDA loss of exclusivity, given the breadth of opportunity in areas both within, as well as outside of oncology. Internally, our leaders are intensely focused on this period and efforts are underway.  Externally, I understand the importance of providing investors with increased transparency into the breadth of opportunities we see in our pipeline that will help us do this.  As we've done recently in highlighting islatravir, our broader HIV portfolio, and our next-generation oncology assets, we're planning deep dive investor events with our scientific and commercial leaders, focused on other areas of our pipeline, that we believe, are underappreciated, yet hold great promise, such as our suite of vaccine candidates, our cardiometabolic assets, as well as others.  Business development plays an important role, and we are putting increased emphasis on ensuring we are appropriately aggressive and accessing the best external science. Executing value-enhancing BD is the top priority, and we intend to add to our pipeline through acquisitions, partnerships, licensing deals and collaborations.  We will be unbounded by therapeutic area, though we are mindful of the need to have a balanced portfolio over time. We'll seek new products, modalities, and platforms that allow us to establish beachheads in important areas. Our recent acquisition of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset is a good example of this.  We will look at both early and late-stage opportunities, and we have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes, particularly given the $9 billion distribution from the Organon spinoff.  And given our strong operational momentum, we are most interested in transactions that are easily integrated and less disruptive, where value is principally derived by the introduction of innovative new products that address patient needs instead of through cost energies.  Before I turn the call over to Frank to discuss second quarter performance in our Human Health business, I want you to know that I appreciate and applaud the increasing societal and investor demands in corporations to act responsibly.  In fact, I believe our strong performance across environmental, social, and governance issues, has and will continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Merck has a long track record and history of strong corporate citizenship, and I'm committed to remaining a leader in this area. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank.\nFrank Clyburn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange.  Across our business, we've been engaging in investing with urgency to encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates, including catch-up for missed doses.  The agility demonstrated by our teams around the world, to quickly reallocate resources to drive these patient activation programs, has benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio. In the U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures have returned to more normal levels.  And on Oncology, we're seeing screening rates continue to improve. We're confident that these favorable trends, and the strong underlying demand for our products, will drive accelerated underlying business momentum in the second half of the year. Now, I'll turn to the second quarter performance of our key brands.  My comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 20% to $4.2 billion, reflecting continued strong global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth, and over the course of the pandemic, has increased its market share of new patients within the immuno-oncology class. KEYTRUDA also maintains its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients.  We continue to see strong growth across all key tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma, and our MSI high indication. Additionally, we are off to a very strong start with our launch of KEYNOTE-355 in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and we look forward to adding overall survival to the label.  We're also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-522 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Outside the U.S., growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza grew 34% in the quarter, and remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth continues to be driven by approvals of recent indications, and we look forward to a potential future launch in adjuvant breast cancer based on the OlympiA data presented at ASCO this year.  LENVIMA grew 15% in the quarter, reflecting increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma following the NRGL listing in China. We're also excited to launch the recently approved combination of LENVIMA plus KEYTRUDA in endometrial carcinoma.  And in the near future, to potentially launch in renal cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-5 KEYNOTE 581. Our vaccines portfolio recovered sharply due to the return to more normal level of wellness visits.  GARDASIL had a very strong quarter, growing 78%. In the U.S., higher sales were driven by a recovery from the negative impact of last year's lockdowns. Outside the U.S., growth was driven by increased demand in China.  Sales also benefited from increased supply due to improved manufacturing, which I'll provide additional details on in a moment. Our hospital business continued its recovery. BRIDION sales grew 67% year-over-year, driven by increased surgeries as patient's access to hospitals improved from last year.  Turning to our outlook. the recovery we saw in the quarter gives us confidence that we will have a very strong second half resulting from both market recovery and strong commercial execution.  Over the quarter, Merck quickly pivoted it's focus and resources to patient activation campaigns to ensure that patients are putting their health first and recognize the importance of returning to physicians offices for screenings, early detection, and routine visits.  Our efforts in partnership with public health constituent groups, paired with the continued rollout of COVID -19 vaccinations, has resulted in meaningful improvements in patients accessing healthcare providers.  And in adolescents, we've seen more than one-third of teens in the U.S. vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least 1 dose. We assume that these rapidly growing vaccination rates and continued commercial execution will help to drive a near-normal back-to-school season.  Merck has also shown increased agility and efficiency across our organization. And importantly, we've made improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. Of note, we expect GARDASIL to significantly benefit from increases in productivity across our supply chain, which will allow us to fulfill demand that we were previously unable to supply.  Furthermore, as global demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply, our teams have been working to ensure we have the right regulatory approvals, and lead time to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as the pandemic continues to force lockdowns in many geographies.  These improvements alone will drive very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the back half of the year, especially in ex-U.S. markets such as China. In oncology, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen to-date, and our overall performance throughout the pandemic.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio,, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, LENVIMA, and if approved, belzutifan, and expect to drive strong and sustained growth across key tumor types and stages of disease.  Overall, the improvements in patient access we are seeing in major markets gives us increased confidence as we look to the second half of the year. Before I conclude, I would like to mention the strong execution of our commercial colleagues around the world that enabled our Company to drive strong growth in the first half of the year.  All the while, we're working to successfully complete the spin-off of Organon. We are confident that the spin-off results in meaningful benefits to the commercial organization, including the ability to drive even stronger growth through more focused commercial execution.  To close, our business has regained momentum, and we are well-positioned to achieve strong growth in the third and fourth quarters. Our portfolio has rebounded with strength, and demonstrated not only its resiliency, but its value to patients globally. [Indiscernible] confidence in the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines.  And we look forward to a return to robust long-term demand-driven growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improved.  As we exit the quarter, we are confident that our position of financial and operational strength, will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, creating value for our shareholders by delivering on our mission to improve the health and wellness to people and animals worldwide.  Now, turning to our second quarter results which reflect Merck on a continuing operations basis. Total Company revenues were $11.4 billion, an increase of 22%, or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange.  Further adjusting for the estimated impact of the pandemic, total revenues grew 8% year-over-year, evidence of the underlying strength of our business. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis.  As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business showed improving momentum, growing 18%, or 6% when adjusted for the estimated impact of the pandemic. Animal Health had an outstanding quarter, increasing 27% driven by very strong global demand across Companion Animal and Livestock, which increased to 38% and 20% respectively.  Animal Health sales grew 19% when adjusted for the estimated pandemic impact. In Companion Animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for vaccines as well as parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products.  Performance in livestock reflects increased global demand across ruminant, swine, and poultry products, along with higher demand for our Animal Health intelligence products. I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis.  Gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6%, reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, pricing pressure, and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix.  Operating expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by higher clinical development costs, increased investment in our early stage pipeline, and high er promotion costs in support of return ed care activities for our key growth drivers.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.6%, an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, driven by these three items last year. Taken together, we are at $1.31 per share, an increase of 27%. Before turning to our 2021 guidance, I want to remind you briefly of the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off of Organon.  With the spin completed, Merck is now a more focused Company and better positioned to unlock the full potential of our growth pillars and drive accelerated profitable growth. We're very excited about our future. And as we look out to 2024, we continue to believe that our revenue potential is underappreciated. Now, for 2021.  Health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the pandemic and we assume this trend will continue. We are narrowing and raising our expected revenue range to $46.4 billion to $47.4 billion, representing growth of 12% to 14%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 2% using mid-July rate.  The underlying demand for our growth pillars and our strong commercial execution provides us with confidence that we will continue to see strong momentum throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we expect total revenues to be sequentially higher in each consecutive quarter.  Our gross margin is expected to be between 76% and 77%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate, driven by increased investment in promotion, and patient activation programs to accelerate our near-term business momentum, and by increased R&D investment, to advance our exciting pipeline to support sustainable long-term revenue growth.  As a reminder, our operating margin from continuing operations will be lower than what they were as a combined Company, as our guidance range implies significant operating leverage in 2021. In addition, we continue to expect operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, driven by our accelerated revenue growth and disciplined investment in our business.  In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $300 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect non - GAAP EPS to between -- excuse me, to be between $5.47 and $5.57, reflecting growth of 21% to 23%.  This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-July rates. As you consider your models and the allocation of revenues to various products, there were two areas to focus on: GARDASIL and Animal Health.  Frank described the strong acceleration in growth expected in GARDASIL, and we also expect continued momentum in our Animal Health business. Our updated guidance also reflects the benefits of the approval of KEYNOTE-522, and as a reminder, does not include revenues from the potential launch of molnupiravir.  Turning to capital allocation. We received a $9-billion cash distribution from Organon, which we intend to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities that align with the parameters Rob outlined. In the absence of meaningful business development, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.  We remain committed to investing in support of our key brands, and progressing our innovative pipeline, and we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. To conclude, as a leaner, more focused, and agile Company, Merck is prepared to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities that lie ahead, and is better equipped to succeed in an ever-changing landscape.  Merck remains in a position of financial and operational strength, which we will leverage to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our patients and shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones in clinical updates, initially on oncology, and then across the broader pipeline.  As Rob highlighted, we continue to show strong momentum in our oncology pipeline, which positions us well. And it's worth reiterating our goal; to potentially deliver 90 plus approvals and new indications by 2028.  A recent report from the American Cancer Society noted that there has been a rapid decrease in lung cancer and melanoma death from 2014 to 2018. One factor attributed in this -- to this decline is advancements in research, including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The report also notes there is an urgent need to accelerate a decline in death rates for breast, prostate, and other cancers, where Merck is just beginning to make an impact. We are hopeful that our contributions, and the advances being made industry-wide, will continue to fuel this decline.  Notably, during the last quarter, we achieved several milestones for treatments targeting women's cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, which, historically, treatment options have been limited, I am pleased to announce several advancements which will improve options for patients.  The first is FDA approval for a new indication in high-risk, early stage triple-negative breast cancer based on results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-522 study, or KEYTRUDA, was evaluating combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then as monotherapy adjuvant treatment post-surgery.  These practice-changing event-free survival results were presented just 2 weeks ago, which demonstrated a remarkable 37% reduction in the risk of progression precluding definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death from any cause compared to chemotherapy alone in patients.  Now additionally, we announced positive clinically meaningful top-line overall survival results, from the Phase III KEYNOTE-355 study, evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined proportion score greater than or equal to 10.  This positions KEYTRUDA to be the first anti-PD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy to show statistically significant overall survival in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We will work with regulators to expand the existing indication to include survival benefits and we'll aim to share full results soon.  Also for early stage breast cancer, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we presented results at ASCO from the Phase III OlympiA trial, evaluating Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA high-risk HER2 negative early-stage breast cancer.  These findings clearly demonstrated that Lynparza reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, or death, by 42%. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial continues to evaluate overall survival.  Now, also at ASCO, with our partners at Seagen, we presented additional encouraging data from the HER2CLIMB studying to Kaiser in patients with early stage HER2 - positive breast cancers. It is clear that Merck is establishing an [Indiscernible] check in breast cancer with multiple agents.  The progress we are making in this area of significant unmet patient need is one example of our strategy to expand into earlier lines of therapy and our strong conviction that our oncology assets have the potential to change the way early stage cancers are treated.  We are also making progress across women's cancer more broadly. We received an approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the combination of KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma, where along with our partners at Eisai, we showed results from the confirmatory Phase III KEYNOTE-775 study earlier this year.  And finally, we have positive results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-826 trial, investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic, cervical cancer, regardless of their PD-L1 status.  The trial met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authority. Additional FDA approvals this quarter included 2 new indications for KEYTRUDA.  The first is in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the Phase III KEYNOTE KEYNOTE-811 study.  The second approval was an expanded indication for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for patients with locally advanced disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This was granted under accelerated approval based on a Phase II KEYNOTE-629 study.  The FDA also granted priority review, based on Phase 3 data from KEYNOTE-581, and first-line treatment, advanced renal cell carcinoma. And we expect a decision in the third quarter. Now, outside the U.S., the European Commission approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA, plus chemotherapy, in certain patients with esophageal cancer or HER2-negative gastro esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, based on results from KEYNOTE-590.  And in China, Lynparza was granted conditional approval for certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who progressed following prior treatment with certain new hormonal agents.  This is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for advanced prostate cancer in China. Now, also at the ASCO virtual meeting, new data supporting the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-564 trial for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma was presented.  KEYTRUDA given after surgery demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence, or death, by 32% compared to placebo. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival.  We are making progress on our strategy to extend the benefit of KEYTRUDA to more patients. This includes the initiation of a Phase III trial, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We believe this new formulation could be an important additional option for patients.  This study will be unrolling soon with a readout expected in early 2023. And finally, belzutifan continues to make good progress with additional Phase Two data presented at ASCO and an expected FDA action date in September, and a development program with 3 Phase III studies in renal cell carcinoma that are gaining momentum. Now, turning to our broader pipeline.  In response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in India, we made the decision to enable access to molnupiravir in low and middle income countries through voluntary license agreements with several Indian generic manufacturers.  While the ongoing studies in India are recruiting a different patient populations, we are encouraged by the data being generated and we look forward to continuing to help with the crisis.  We remain excited by the progress in molnupiravir and the data we've seen to date. Along with our partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced the presentation of full results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease 2021.  We look forward to the readout from the Phase III portion of this study in the October timeframe. Additionally, we posted a new Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option, and look forward to a readout in the first half of 2022.  In HIV, we continue to progress our islatravir development program, our investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Phase II data presented at the International AIDS Society meeting a few weeks ago continued to support the safety and tolerability profile of oral once monthly islatravir in the PrEP setting.  We are continuing to enroll patients across diverse populations and geographies in the Phase III empower trials, and are moving forward with studies evaluating islatravir in treatment and prevention settings. In vaccines.  I am pleased to note the FDA approval of VAXNEUVANCE, the first in a suite, a promising pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 18 years and older caused by 15 serotypes.  Along with immune response data showing that VAXNEUVANCE can maintain progress achieved to date, based on non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCVs 13, VAXNEUVANCE also induced superior immune response to PCV13 for shared serotypes 3 and for the 2 serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F.  These immunogenicity data position this vaccine to offer an important new option and protection of adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. We look forward to further engagement with the ACIP, including discussing the positive results we achieved through our robust development program studying a broad range of adult populations and clinical circumstances, including adults at increased risk.  Building on our clinical evidence for VAXNEUVANCE, we also announced that 2 of our Phase III pediatric study met their primary immunogenicity and safety endpoints in supporting potential use in healthy infants who may have previously started a pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13, and in the catch-up setting for healthy children who have either not received pneumococcal vaccines, or have received a full or partial regimen with lower valency pediatric PCVs.  We continue to anticipate data from our Phase I/II program, evaluating V116, our adult focused vaccine to read out later this year. To conclude, I remain excited about the progress in our broader pipeline, and efforts stemming from Merck Research Labs, that contribute to improving options and treatments for diseases that affect people globally.  We continue to deliver on our strategy with speed and urgency to harness the benefits of our cancer therapies for as many patients as possible, while advancing a broad pipeline of promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates. Now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Mary, will you please start the question-and-answer session? And to help to get to more questioners today, we ask that each analyst limit themselves to 1 question. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question. For my 1 question here, just a bigger picture one for Rob. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the business development environment? If not your post the Organon transaction that you're highlighting, R&D is a priority, bringing more innovation to the Company is a priority.  But how are you thinking about deals that would accelerate the Company's investment in oncology where they obviously have a competitive strength versus more therapeutic area diversification? And can you maybe just walk through the pros and cons as you consider and think about larger transactions versus a series of smaller deals?  I know you're looking at everything, but I'm just trying to get -- since if all else equal, is there a bias one way or the other at this point? Thanks so much.\nRob Davis: Sure. Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Chris, and good morning. As we -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development, and it's something that we recognize we need to do. We need to augment the pipeline.  But I also just want to reinforce, and I think hopefully you heard it through what Dean just walked through, we also have a strong internal pipeline, and I don't want to lose sight of that. And we really do have a lot of confidence in what we can bring forward across the breadth of both oncology assets, as well as assets outside of oncology and vaccines. Obviously in HIV, all the areas that Dean touched upon. But with that said, we know we need to add more and build upon that, and we're very focused there. Clearly, we see ourselves, and I made a comment about this in the prepared remarks, with the strength in oncology.  And we want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a Company that, over time, can be a broad player across oncology, really leveraging the foundational position we have with KEYTRUDA to going well beyond KEYTRUDA, and we're already starting to do that.  As we think about business development, I always will look at that because if you look right now in the space of where there's still one of the largest unmet needs, despite the advances we've made with KEYTRUDA and other new agents, which are phenomenal in what they're delivering for patients, the truth is the majority of patients still don't have a solution yet for the cancers they face.  This is still an area of unmet need. There's a ton of science being done in this area -- focused in this area. And as I said, we have the strength to leverage the position of KEYTRUDA and the data we have within our oncology space, to really be a differentiated, and I think unique observer of the space to be able to select the best opportunity.  So that will be a focus. But I also recognize we have to do more than that, we need to be balanced, and we are looking to areas outside of oncology as well. And I would like to see us do things in both. Build the strong foundation, continue to lead in oncology, leverage the data we have there, but look to where can we balance that, and augment the portfolio on outside areas.  On the second part of the question, on the pros and cons between large and small deals, in a perfect world we would -- where we think we bring the greatest value, is if you get assets that are a little bit earlier in development where we can bring the prowess we have from a clinical side to bring those through and really add value.  Those are the deals we've been doing historically. But we're not foreclosed to doing larger deals. And as we've always said, and I continue to believe, it's more about finding the right science. Driven first was science as the key component, informed by the portfolio impact where we believed we had value.  And if we can find those deals, we will move on them, whether they are large or small. But clearly one of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go, is to the very large synergy-driven deals.  I think we have enough firepower on our own pipeline. And through what we can add across the portfolio with deals focused on the science, we don't need to go to those large type of deals at this time.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Chris. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys, thanks so much for taking my question. I thought I'd focus a little bit on molnupiravir, since that's the trial that's coming up. And presumably, it's also the biggest needle mover on numbers for next year as we think about it.  My question is this, the 0.5 to 0.7 log antiviral benefit that you're seeing, what feedback are you hearing on that magnitude of viral load drop? And what's the feedback on the clinical benefit observed with that in the mobile trial?  And I ask because it looks like even though you are limiting your primary analysis to patients enrolled in less than five days, I still think there's a fair amount of seropositives embedded within the way you're looking at the data. And I almost wonder, if seronegative is probably that population where you've probably see n the most cleanest signal. I'd be very curious. Thank you.\nDean Li: Yeah, this is Dean. Let me take that question. We are advancing molnupiravir in a Phase III clinical trial. It is focused on the outpatient setting, and we are focusing it on high-risk patients. The reason I emphasize that is, your observations in relationship to viral load and as such are important observations.  But I would just call out that, at least with -- on the U.S. regulatory framework, the viral load is not the critical issue for the regulatory framework; it is whether or not we can affect clinical events. And so the need to focus on high-risk patients is the critical issue that we want to focus on.  In relationship to that trial, it has a primary completion date that's listed as October. And we are very enthusiastic of how this trial is progressing, and we hope to see data over the coming months for the trial.  I would emphasize that this is a blinded global study and it is focused on high risk and many of the -- the pandemic keeps shifting, and so it's not just within the U.S. and the EU, but important countries like South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, those countries are extremely important for our ability to show not just the reduction of viral load, but a big impact on clinical effect. That's what we need to look for in this trial.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great, thanks, Umer, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question for you is just how we should think about your margin expansion opportunities. I know you've given some longer term guidance. But let's say over the next 12 months, how would that progress? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: Louise, this is Caroline. Thank you for your question. First, I'll start with our pipeline is rich. And therefore as a Company, we are focused in growing expenses to support the near-term and long-term opportunities that we have, which will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth.  That said, we are also expecting to drive margin expansion. And that margin expansion will come from a few different factors. It will come through from the revenue growth. It will also come from a change in our product mix.  And it will also come through efficiencies across our business and our commitment to deliver $1.5 billion of operating efficiencies over the 3-year period. Finally, we do expect an increase in margin in 2024 as a result of the step-down of royalties, specific to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL.  So as I think about margin expansion, our guidance for this year at the midpoint of the range assumes that 2 percentage point increase in margin. And I expect that margin expansion to continue to grow as you look out to the coming year.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Louise. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terrence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nTerrence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two-parter: I guess, Rob, just curious if you're setting any internal timelines for use of the Organon proceeds and would welcome your latest view of asset valuations.  And then for Dean, there's obviously been a tremendous amount of progress with new platforms over the last 12 to 18 months. And Rob, you touched on some of these, but any of that particularly stand out to you as having the potential to be as transformative as antibodies were 20 years ago? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Terrence, thanks for the question. As we look forward, we're actively looking and want to move with speed. I don't want to put a time limit on how fast because, obviously, some of it is based on market factors, and where assets are in their own lifecycle, and in discussions we're having.  Right now, we're focused on trying to find the ways to deliver to the pipeline through BD, but it's not timed down. I think what Caroline's really trying to say is, eventually, if we don't find those opportunities, we're not going to sit on the cash forever. But I want to make sure that we put the priority on BD first before we make that determination.\nDean Li: In relationship to your second question, it's almost -- there's such a laundry list of advancements in data and technology that whatever I say, I'm going to miss saying something. And I will just focus not so much in platforms.  There's a lot of movement in data platforms that I think are critically important, but also in what I would call it technology platforms that are important for making molecules, as you said, such as antibodies. Clearly, there's a lot of movement in protein engineering. Clearly, there's movement in protein degradation.  Clearly, there's movement in antibody-drug conjugates. And we are interested in all of them. I think one of the critical questions that often people think about, especially in relationship to us as a vaccine Company, is in relationship to mRNA.  And really the success of a monovalent SARS -CoV-2 vaccine is something that's demonstrated the speed which we've always recognized, but also scalability. And we were one of the first to invest in mRNA for vaccines, for ID, and for oncology. And so we're taking some of those lessons and we're prioritizing programs where we believe that mRNA will be implored.  I do want to emphasize that those programs -- that said, programs such as pneumococcal vaccines, I don't think is a place where mRNA vaccines is a place to take it. And complex multivalent vaccines with profound and proven clinical benefits such as GARDASIL. I'm not so sure that that's where I would drive an mRNA vaccine.  Outside of infectious disease, we continue to have a very productive partnership with Moderna on oncology. Where we're a little bit more careful is outside of the use of vaccines. We watch with interest the progression of that technology.\nRob Davis: And Terrence, my apologies. I recognized I didn't answer the last part of your question on valuations. What we are seeing in the marketplace are things tend to still be fully valued. And as we know, there's a lot of capital flowing into the biotech space.  That obviously presents a challenge, but I would just point to you that we recognize we need to be appropriately aggressive as we go after these opportunities. And I continue to believe that if we apply where we see differential opportunity, based on our scientific read of what's out there, we can still create value while we're strategically adding to the pipeline. And that's really where we're focused.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Terence. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: The market doesn't credit the pipeline that you're doing, including growth such as islatravir. Without stating [Indiscernible], I'm focused on [Indiscernible] at the end of the decade. The reason I say that is previously, Rob, you have highlighted Merck recognizes need to raise the curtains on a pipeline axis to a great degree with -- shown historically.  You have very large safe spaces [Indiscernible] among others. When should we expect to see that curtain being raised? And then just an add on. Yes, [Indiscernible] question. Merck has a program of islatravir they're taking in to committ. Do you believe it infringes your intellectual property? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Andrew, we will try to answer the question. To be honest with you, you came through very, very garbled. I think your question -- the first part of the question was about pipeline transparency and when are we going to be showing more information if we're on that. As I said, that is an area of focus.  We did that with what -- when we showed you the broader HIV Portfolio and the work we did recently to give some insights to our broader early-stage oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA. Our thought and thinking is probably, as we approach probably closer to the end of the year, I think we're going to plan to have another session.  And then, obviously, we'll think about as we move into next year. But areas we want to highlight as we move forward, clearly, as I mentioned, cardiometabolic is an area where we have growing conviction and interest.  We're very interested in our broader vaccines portfolio and we see a lot of opportunity there. So those will be some areas where we'll be focusing in the future. And then I think you were asking if we saw a pro-drug IP issue with islatravir. I'll turn that over to Dean if he's aware of -- if I got the question right.\nDean Li: Right. So first of all, Islatravir is a foundational element that one could build on and that's what our strategy is built on, monotherapy for prevention and combination in terms of treatment. So the interest in Islatravir, I kind of take it as validation of how strong we believe in Islatravir and this mechanism.  In terms of the, the Legal status, we're very comfortable in where we fit in relationship with islatravir. I don't want to speak directly to freedom to operate and all of that in relationship to other people's compounds, until we see the details of the structure in all of this. But we are very confident in our investment and our patent position in relationship to Islatravir.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daina Graybosch with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: All right. Thanks for the question. I just want to ask one on pneumococcal. I wonder if you could give us your base and best case for the October AICP meeting, given the June preview analysis. Didn't it consider some of the strengths of your vaccine around Serotec 3 and other strongs?\nDean Li: Let me first take it and then I'll pass it on to Frank. We're very confident in the clinical program of our V114 vaccine event and the strength of the data that serves as the basis for the filing, which showed broad protection against disease-causing serotypes and improved immune performance for serious serotypes that persist.  This will be an important point. Not all serotypes are equal. There are certain serotypes that are far more important than others. And so, I think it will be very important at the ACIP to understand the epidemiology and how one thinks through that.  Now, we've demonstrated that the immune response data really shows that we have non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCV13, and that we have superior for 3 that are quite important from an epidemiologic standpoint.  I think the other issue that I just want to also elevate is that we also are advancing V114, or VAXNEUVANCE, not just in relationship to adults, but we're advancing it aggressively in relationship to the pediatrics. And we are also advancing a more bespoke adult - focused vaccine V116 that we hope to share data on over the next year or so. Frank?\nFrank Clyburn: And what I would say is, one, we're very -- we're excited about the opportunity we have overall for a pneumococcal franchise. To your question on the ACIP, we are waiting to better understand the future recommendations, really, of all the vaccines, PNEUMOVAX, VAXNEUVANCE, and PREVNAR 20.  You saw some of the information that came out in June. At this time, there may be a shift and some preference towards some of the newer pneumococcal vaccines, that they go with an age based recommendation, there are number of populations that they're looking at in their recommendations.  And right now we're focused on really making sure they understand our data and the benefits of our offerings across some are both PNEUMOVAX 23 and VAXNEUVANCE. So if there is some risk to Pneumovax, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how that plays out, but I would also highlight that this is for us expressively VAXNEUVANCE as being talked about in the beginning.  We think we have a very competitive offering in adults. We're very excited about the opportunity we have for pediatrics and you heard being mentioned our 2 Phase III trials in pediatrics as well, as we're continuing to develop V116 aimed for adults and also V117.  When we look at the overall pneumococcal franchise and, I would say, vaccines as a growth pillar for our Company, we're very confident in the continued growth for vaccines for the Company both near-term and in the long-term.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Daina. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Rob, I want to ask another strategy question just coming off the completion of the spin, and to see what the guardrails are when you think about BD.  So the question is, would diversifying the revenue mix away from oncology take priority over the up margin expansion you're expected to have. And then to put a finer point on therapeutic areas.  I know you lead whereever the science takes you, but what are your thoughts on the orphan drug arena or expanding the footprint of neuroscience, now that there's apparently a more favorable FDA environment? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Geoff, I appreciate the question. As we think about business development and how we think about that relative to our margin goals we have for the Company, a couple of comments. One, it's important to say we do believe over time, as I said, we need to have a balanced -- more balanced portfolio, and we'd like to bring that diversification.  I would make 1 clarification to your point. I see a difference in diversification away from KEYTRUDA versus diversification away from oncology. Obviously, oncology is a broad field. And as I said it earlier, with huge unmet needs still -- still rests there.  That's an area where we can leverage the strength that we have with KEYTRUDA, the foundational position we have, the data we have, the insights we get from basically being tested, either combined with, or against pretty much every agent out there. And so I see expansion and diversification across broader oncology as an important goal for us future -- into the future.  And then I do believe we also should look for other therapeutic areas. We have a strong position in vaccines. We are looking there. We've mentioned cardiometabolic as an area. And in fact, Dean can make a comment on neuroscience, where we actually have several ongoing early stage programs in the neuroscience space, so we're excited about that.  To your question on what do we prioritize. First and foremost, I prioritize long-term sustainable growth. And that, in our business, is about innovation and investment in science. And so we always will prioritize that. I believe we can both deliver that and bring operating margin expansion to the business. But if it's a matter of driving cost reduction or investing in growth, I always will invest in growth.\nDean Li: Let me take a shot at that question that you had in relationship to orphan disease and neuroscience. I would highlight that if we're looking at rare diseases, I do like rare diseases because it's a very quick way to understand proof-of-concept and can move quickly.  And then once you're at that situation, the ability to expand from that beach head is very important. And the reason I want to emphasize that is deals [Indiscernible], although an oncology, is really a rare disease play with the possibility of expanding into broader cancers.  Whether we see that in cancer or in non-cancer assets and pathways and possibilities, that's something that we're very interested to replicate. In relationship to neurosciences, you're right. There has been movement recently of the FDA and the important biomarkers.  But I do want to level set that the importance of biomarkers must also be balanced by the importance of being able to show changes in important clinical events for patients. It has changed and we're very anxious to understand how we can best utilize that movement for biomarkers, and especially for example, our phospho Tau program, which we're very enthusiastic of advancing. How that should navigate, and how we should think about, for example, biomarkers such as Tau biomarkers in that clinical strategy is of intense interest to us, giving the shifting landscape. We have other neuroscience programs, MK MK-8189 is in Phase II for Schizophrenia, we have MK-1942 that we're advancing for treatment-resistant depression.  The regulatory landscape changing in neuroscience is important. It is something that we've taken in account and it is affecting how we navigate the field and accelerate the programs that we have. And it also changes how we look at business development as well.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Geoff. We realize it's 9 o'clock. We're going to go a few minutes late to get to more questions. Next question, please, Mary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nRonny Gal: Good morning, and thank you for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about -- more about using mRNA on a multivalent approach. You notice that it's a hard problem. Is this a theoretically impossible issue, or just an engineering issue of getting messenger RNA vaccines to be multivalent?\nDean Li: I'll take that question. The issue with multivalency is, it's the more valence that you have in any vaccines, it becomes a more complicated issue. The other issue is the dose that you need, and what we would call the reactogenicity every time that you add something.  I don't -- it would be remiss for me to say that anything's impossible. Science and technology changes. But the framework that I was trying to lay out is that there are places where I think the field would race in relationship to mRNA to have an impact clinically.  And then there are other parts of the field where I think more discovery and development of the technology, there will be an intense interest to overcome some of those initial barriers.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Ronny. Next question,please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nMara Goldstein: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I had a question on pricing, as we came into the beginning of this year, one of the things that Merck had commented on, was that pricing was a potentially a major -- continue to be a major issue for the pharmaceutical industry and that pressure is only going to increase.  We saw a few days ago, a little bit of hand waving, I think on the part of the Biden administration, about something about settled government being able to negotiate pricing in Medicare systems. So I'm just wondering, as rounding out of 2021, and into 2022, what the Company's thoughts around pricing are?\nRob Davis: Yeah. Thank you. I'll take that question. Clearly, we continue to expect to see ongoing pressure on pricing and I think the dialogue that you're pointing to the tapping right now with Congress. And then, also, with the Biden administration only reinforces that that threat continues to be there. But I think as we focus on it, a couple of points.  One, as we look forward, all of the expectations we have for our growth as a Company that we've communicated in the past does assume we face meaningful price pressure. So we continue to believe our growth will be driven more by volumes than price.  And I think that's important as you think about the long-term risk position of the Company. As we look out over the next 5 plus years, we're largely be risked to our revenue goals. And I think we can achieve it regardless of price.  Putting that aside, as you think about it from a policy perspective, we're very willing to engage with the U.S. government in discussions about how best to achieve a goal of reducing the out-of-pocket costs for patients. That is our foremost goal. We actually recognize that need and are willing, and want, to work with them around that goal.  Understanding, we want to protect innovation, because we also want to be able to ensure we can bring the innovations for the next generation of patients that need them. I think the whole situation with COVID has shown why you want a robust and innovative industry because at the moment, you need it.  It's important that it's here in our country and we can invest and drive it. So that's our focus. But again, it's really about where it is that we can see reductions in out-of-pocket cost areas where they look either legislatively or otherwise, that don't shift any kind of savings to the patient in their pocketbook, we\u2019re opposed to.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Mara. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays, your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on the performance in China, you had a very nice quarter there. Was hoping to get a little bit more color on exactly what drove that -- the performance with GARDASIL, with LENVIMA.  I ask really in the context of your messaging around the GARDASIL performance you expect in the second half and the additional supply capacity coming online. So some color on those fronts would be helpful. Thank you. \nFranklin Clyburn: Yeah. Hi, Carter, it\u2019s Frank. Yeah, China grew very strong this quarter, I think it was 42% if you exclude foreign exchange. It was really driven by GARDASIL. Very strong growth as we mentioned and we anticipate that will continue as we move forward because of the significant number of patients and still the relatively small penetration that we have for GARDASIL in China.  So clearly we see opportunities there. I'd also like to highlight that we did see very strong growth, again within oncology, LENVIMA, Lynparza, KEYTRUDA grew very strong this quarter. So a number of our growth drivers, and in addition to that, we also are still seeing strong growth for Januvia in diabetes in China as well.  So we anticipate that we'll continue to see growth. I think this ties very well to our strategy where we pivoted and focused more on our innovative portfolio of products for China and that\u2019s why we are very confident in the future growth within China.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Carter. We have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala, with Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much. Can you provide an update on the anti-IoT4 antibody? A number of new trials have been initiated recently. What is it that Merck sees in this target that is interesting? Thank you.\nDean Li: Yeah, this is the -- IoT4 is a program that we\u2019re watching very carefully in our own pipeline. It is a program that was initiated by us looking at patient data from clinical trials with Pembrolizumab, and looking at those patients who are responsive, but more importantly, those patients who are not responsive and understanding what are possible mechanisms.  The other point that I would just empathize is IoT4 in some sense is a checkpoint inhibitor, but it is not a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor. And there's always been a discussion of whether another class of immune cells, such as myeloid cells, could be really important and so that's the second reason why we're very interested.  But quite frankly, the third point that I would make is all of that is interesting science and is a great hypothesis, but fundamentally, we have to have clinical trials that show that. We are advancing clinical trials for IoT4.  And I think that the interest in other companies to follow our lead in IoT4 is based on the fact that they see us advancing it, and we believe that our data will support us advancing it. And we'll just have to see what that benefit is, but it is a highly differentiated first-in-class mechanism, not just in the molecule, but in the cellular approach of how we're attacking cancer broadly.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you Steve, and thank you all for your really good questions today. I\u2019ll turn it to Rob for some closing remarks.\nRob Davis: Great, Thanks Peter. As we discussed today, hopefully what you get a sense of is that we do have significant opportunities for growth and value creation. I'm committed to make it happen and I know my team is as well, and importantly, we're confident we'll be able to do so.  Merck is a Company that matters. And as we think about that, we know we need to evolve, that we hold a special place in the world and we're committed to delivering for the patients who are counting on us.  And frankly to deliver the sustainable growth that I know our shareholders want to see and I'm confident we will do so. So I look forward to giving you updates on our progress as we move forward, and I wish you all to have a great rest of your day.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes this conference call, thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. I'm delighted to be here today to provide an overview of progress made over the past quarter. I will cover key regulatory milestones in clinical updates, initially on oncology, and then across the broader pipeline.  As Rob highlighted, we continue to show strong momentum in our oncology pipeline, which positions us well. And it's worth reiterating our goal; to potentially deliver 90 plus approvals and new indications by 2028.  A recent report from the American Cancer Society noted that there has been a rapid decrease in lung cancer and melanoma death from 2014 to 2018. One factor attributed in this -- to this decline is advancements in research, including targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The report also notes there is an urgent need to accelerate a decline in death rates for breast, prostate, and other cancers, where Merck is just beginning to make an impact. We are hopeful that our contributions, and the advances being made industry-wide, will continue to fuel this decline.  Notably, during the last quarter, we achieved several milestones for treatments targeting women's cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer, which, historically, treatment options have been limited, I am pleased to announce several advancements which will improve options for patients.  The first is FDA approval for a new indication in high-risk, early stage triple-negative breast cancer based on results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-522 study, or KEYTRUDA, was evaluating combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment, and then as monotherapy adjuvant treatment post-surgery.  These practice-changing event-free survival results were presented just 2 weeks ago, which demonstrated a remarkable 37% reduction in the risk of progression precluding definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death from any cause compared to chemotherapy alone in patients.  Now additionally, we announced positive clinically meaningful top-line overall survival results, from the Phase III KEYNOTE-355 study, evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, whose tumors express PD-L1 with a combined proportion score greater than or equal to 10.  This positions KEYTRUDA to be the first anti-PD1 therapy in combination with chemotherapy to show statistically significant overall survival in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. We will work with regulators to expand the existing indication to include survival benefits and we'll aim to share full results soon.  Also for early stage breast cancer, along with our partners at AstraZeneca, we presented results at ASCO from the Phase III OlympiA trial, evaluating Lynparza for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA high-risk HER2 negative early-stage breast cancer.  These findings clearly demonstrated that Lynparza reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence, second cancers, or death, by 42%. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial continues to evaluate overall survival.  Now, also at ASCO, with our partners at Seagen, we presented additional encouraging data from the HER2CLIMB studying to Kaiser in patients with early stage HER2 - positive breast cancers. It is clear that Merck is establishing an [Indiscernible] check in breast cancer with multiple agents.  The progress we are making in this area of significant unmet patient need is one example of our strategy to expand into earlier lines of therapy and our strong conviction that our oncology assets have the potential to change the way early stage cancers are treated.  We are also making progress across women's cancer more broadly. We received an approval from the FDA for an expanded indication for the combination of KEYTRUDA and LENVIMA for the treatment of certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma, where along with our partners at Eisai, we showed results from the confirmatory Phase III KEYNOTE-775 study earlier this year.  And finally, we have positive results from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-826 trial, investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic, cervical cancer, regardless of their PD-L1 status.  The trial met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival and progression-free survival. Results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authority. Additional FDA approvals this quarter included 2 new indications for KEYTRUDA.  The first is in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on results from the Phase III KEYNOTE KEYNOTE-811 study.  The second approval was an expanded indication for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for patients with locally advanced disease that is not curable by surgery or radiation. This was granted under accelerated approval based on a Phase II KEYNOTE-629 study.  The FDA also granted priority review, based on Phase 3 data from KEYNOTE-581, and first-line treatment, advanced renal cell carcinoma. And we expect a decision in the third quarter. Now, outside the U.S., the European Commission approved a new indication for KEYTRUDA, plus chemotherapy, in certain patients with esophageal cancer or HER2-negative gastro esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, based on results from KEYNOTE-590.  And in China, Lynparza was granted conditional approval for certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, who progressed following prior treatment with certain new hormonal agents.  This is the first PARP inhibitor to be approved for advanced prostate cancer in China. Now, also at the ASCO virtual meeting, new data supporting the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy from the pivotal Phase III KEYNOTE-564 trial for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma was presented.  KEYTRUDA given after surgery demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease recurrence, or death, by 32% compared to placebo. Results will be submitted to global regulatory authorities and the trial will continue to evaluate overall survival.  We are making progress on our strategy to extend the benefit of KEYTRUDA to more patients. This includes the initiation of a Phase III trial, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We believe this new formulation could be an important additional option for patients.  This study will be unrolling soon with a readout expected in early 2023. And finally, belzutifan continues to make good progress with additional Phase Two data presented at ASCO and an expected FDA action date in September, and a development program with 3 Phase III studies in renal cell carcinoma that are gaining momentum. Now, turning to our broader pipeline.  In response to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in India, we made the decision to enable access to molnupiravir in low and middle income countries through voluntary license agreements with several Indian generic manufacturers.  While the ongoing studies in India are recruiting a different patient populations, we are encouraged by the data being generated and we look forward to continuing to help with the crisis.  We remain excited by the progress in molnupiravir and the data we've seen to date. Along with our partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced the presentation of full results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease 2021.  We look forward to the readout from the Phase III portion of this study in the October timeframe. Additionally, we posted a new Phase III study evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option, and look forward to a readout in the first half of 2022.  In HIV, we continue to progress our islatravir development program, our investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Phase II data presented at the International AIDS Society meeting a few weeks ago continued to support the safety and tolerability profile of oral once monthly islatravir in the PrEP setting.  We are continuing to enroll patients across diverse populations and geographies in the Phase III empower trials, and are moving forward with studies evaluating islatravir in treatment and prevention settings. In vaccines.  I am pleased to note the FDA approval of VAXNEUVANCE, the first in a suite, a promising pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 18 years and older caused by 15 serotypes.  Along with immune response data showing that VAXNEUVANCE can maintain progress achieved to date, based on non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCVs 13, VAXNEUVANCE also induced superior immune response to PCV13 for shared serotypes 3 and for the 2 serotypes unique to VAXNEUVANCE, 22F and 33F.  These immunogenicity data position this vaccine to offer an important new option and protection of adults from invasive pneumococcal disease. We look forward to further engagement with the ACIP, including discussing the positive results we achieved through our robust development program studying a broad range of adult populations and clinical circumstances, including adults at increased risk.  Building on our clinical evidence for VAXNEUVANCE, we also announced that 2 of our Phase III pediatric study met their primary immunogenicity and safety endpoints in supporting potential use in healthy infants who may have previously started a pneumococcal vaccination series with PCV13, and in the catch-up setting for healthy children who have either not received pneumococcal vaccines, or have received a full or partial regimen with lower valency pediatric PCVs.  We continue to anticipate data from our Phase I/II program, evaluating V116, our adult focused vaccine to read out later this year. To conclude, I remain excited about the progress in our broader pipeline, and efforts stemming from Merck Research Labs, that contribute to improving options and treatments for diseases that affect people globally.  We continue to deliver on our strategy with speed and urgency to harness the benefits of our cancer therapies for as many patients as possible, while advancing a broad pipeline of promising vaccines and therapeutic candidates. Now I will turn the call back to Peter. Yeah, this is Dean. Let me take that question. We are advancing molnupiravir in a Phase III clinical trial. It is focused on the outpatient setting, and we are focusing it on high-risk patients. The reason I emphasize that is, your observations in relationship to viral load and as such are important observations.  But I would just call out that, at least with -- on the U.S. regulatory framework, the viral load is not the critical issue for the regulatory framework; it is whether or not we can affect clinical events. And so the need to focus on high-risk patients is the critical issue that we want to focus on.  In relationship to that trial, it has a primary completion date that's listed as October. And we are very enthusiastic of how this trial is progressing, and we hope to see data over the coming months for the trial.  I would emphasize that this is a blinded global study and it is focused on high risk and many of the -- the pandemic keeps shifting, and so it's not just within the U.S. and the EU, but important countries like South Africa, Brazil, Colombia, those countries are extremely important for our ability to show not just the reduction of viral load, but a big impact on clinical effect. That's what we need to look for in this trial. In relationship to your second question, it's almost -- there's such a laundry list of advancements in data and technology that whatever I say, I'm going to miss saying something. And I will just focus not so much in platforms.  There's a lot of movement in data platforms that I think are critically important, but also in what I would call it technology platforms that are important for making molecules, as you said, such as antibodies. Clearly, there's a lot of movement in protein engineering. Clearly, there's movement in protein degradation.  Clearly, there's movement in antibody-drug conjugates. And we are interested in all of them. I think one of the critical questions that often people think about, especially in relationship to us as a vaccine Company, is in relationship to mRNA.  And really the success of a monovalent SARS -CoV-2 vaccine is something that's demonstrated the speed which we've always recognized, but also scalability. And we were one of the first to invest in mRNA for vaccines, for ID, and for oncology. And so we're taking some of those lessons and we're prioritizing programs where we believe that mRNA will be implored.  I do want to emphasize that those programs -- that said, programs such as pneumococcal vaccines, I don't think is a place where mRNA vaccines is a place to take it. And complex multivalent vaccines with profound and proven clinical benefits such as GARDASIL. I'm not so sure that that's where I would drive an mRNA vaccine.  Outside of infectious disease, we continue to have a very productive partnership with Moderna on oncology. Where we're a little bit more careful is outside of the use of vaccines. We watch with interest the progression of that technology. Right. So first of all, Islatravir is a foundational element that one could build on and that's what our strategy is built on, monotherapy for prevention and combination in terms of treatment. So the interest in Islatravir, I kind of take it as validation of how strong we believe in Islatravir and this mechanism.  In terms of the, the Legal status, we're very comfortable in where we fit in relationship with islatravir. I don't want to speak directly to freedom to operate and all of that in relationship to other people's compounds, until we see the details of the structure in all of this. But we are very confident in our investment and our patent position in relationship to Islatravir. Let me first take it and then I'll pass it on to Frank. We're very confident in the clinical program of our V114 vaccine event and the strength of the data that serves as the basis for the filing, which showed broad protection against disease-causing serotypes and improved immune performance for serious serotypes that persist.  This will be an important point. Not all serotypes are equal. There are certain serotypes that are far more important than others. And so, I think it will be very important at the ACIP to understand the epidemiology and how one thinks through that.  Now, we've demonstrated that the immune response data really shows that we have non-inferiority to stereotypes shared with PCV13, and that we have superior for 3 that are quite important from an epidemiologic standpoint.  I think the other issue that I just want to also elevate is that we also are advancing V114, or VAXNEUVANCE, not just in relationship to adults, but we're advancing it aggressively in relationship to the pediatrics. And we are also advancing a more bespoke adult - focused vaccine V116 that we hope to share data on over the next year or so. Frank? Let me take a shot at that question that you had in relationship to orphan disease and neuroscience. I would highlight that if we're looking at rare diseases, I do like rare diseases because it's a very quick way to understand proof-of-concept and can move quickly.  And then once you're at that situation, the ability to expand from that beach head is very important. And the reason I want to emphasize that is deals [Indiscernible], although an oncology, is really a rare disease play with the possibility of expanding into broader cancers.  Whether we see that in cancer or in non-cancer assets and pathways and possibilities, that's something that we're very interested to replicate. In relationship to neurosciences, you're right. There has been movement recently of the FDA and the important biomarkers.  But I do want to level set that the importance of biomarkers must also be balanced by the importance of being able to show changes in important clinical events for patients. It has changed and we're very anxious to understand how we can best utilize that movement for biomarkers, and especially for example, our phospho Tau program, which we're very enthusiastic of advancing. How that should navigate, and how we should think about, for example, biomarkers such as Tau biomarkers in that clinical strategy is of intense interest to us, giving the shifting landscape. We have other neuroscience programs, MK MK-8189 is in Phase II for Schizophrenia, we have MK-1942 that we're advancing for treatment-resistant depression.  The regulatory landscape changing in neuroscience is important. It is something that we've taken in account and it is affecting how we navigate the field and accelerate the programs that we have. And it also changes how we look at business development as well. I'll take that question. The issue with multivalency is, it's the more valence that you have in any vaccines, it becomes a more complicated issue. The other issue is the dose that you need, and what we would call the reactogenicity every time that you add something.  I don't -- it would be remiss for me to say that anything's impossible. Science and technology changes. But the framework that I was trying to lay out is that there are places where I think the field would race in relationship to mRNA to have an impact clinically.  And then there are other parts of the field where I think more discovery and development of the technology, there will be an intense interest to overcome some of those initial barriers. Yeah, this is the -- IoT4 is a program that we're watching very carefully in our own pipeline. It is a program that was initiated by us looking at patient data from clinical trials with Pembrolizumab, and looking at those patients who are responsive, but more importantly, those patients who are not responsive and understanding what are possible mechanisms.  The other point that I would just empathize is IoT4 in some sense is a checkpoint inhibitor, but it is not a T-cell checkpoint inhibitor. And there's always been a discussion of whether another class of immune cells, such as myeloid cells, could be really important and so that's the second reason why we're very interested.  But quite frankly, the third point that I would make is all of that is interesting science and is a great hypothesis, but fundamentally, we have to have clinical trials that show that. We are advancing clinical trials for IoT4.  And I think that the interest in other companies to follow our lead in IoT4 is based on the fact that they see us advancing it, and we believe that our data will support us advancing it. And we'll just have to see what that benefit is, but it is a highly differentiated first-in-class mechanism, not just in the molecule, but in the cellular approach of how we're attacking cancer broadly."

            "name": "Frank Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, our Human Health business continues to regain momentum and we achieved 18% growth in the quarter, excluding the impact of exchange.  Across our business, we've been engaging in investing with urgency to encourage more normal levels of physician office visits, oncology screenings, and vaccination rates, including catch-up for missed doses.  The agility demonstrated by our teams around the world, to quickly reallocate resources to drive these patient activation programs, has benefited our largely physician-administered portfolio. In the U.S., we are encouraged that wellness visits and surgical procedures have returned to more normal levels.  And on Oncology, we're seeing screening rates continue to improve. We're confident that these favorable trends, and the strong underlying demand for our products, will drive accelerated underlying business momentum in the second half of the year. Now, I'll turn to the second quarter performance of our key brands.  My comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 20% to $4.2 billion, reflecting continued strong global demand. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth, and over the course of the pandemic, has increased its market share of new patients within the immuno-oncology class. KEYTRUDA also maintains its leadership position in lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients.  We continue to see strong growth across all key tumors, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma, and our MSI high indication. Additionally, we are off to a very strong start with our launch of KEYNOTE-355 in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, and we look forward to adding overall survival to the label.  We're also excited by the recent approval and upcoming launch of KEYNOTE-522 in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. Outside the U.S., growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza grew 34% in the quarter, and remains the leading PARP inhibitor. Growth continues to be driven by approvals of recent indications, and we look forward to a potential future launch in adjuvant breast cancer based on the OlympiA data presented at ASCO this year.  LENVIMA grew 15% in the quarter, reflecting increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma following the NRGL listing in China. We're also excited to launch the recently approved combination of LENVIMA plus KEYTRUDA in endometrial carcinoma.  And in the near future, to potentially launch in renal cell carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-5 KEYNOTE 581. Our vaccines portfolio recovered sharply due to the return to more normal level of wellness visits.  GARDASIL had a very strong quarter, growing 78%. In the U.S., higher sales were driven by a recovery from the negative impact of last year's lockdowns. Outside the U.S., growth was driven by increased demand in China.  Sales also benefited from increased supply due to improved manufacturing, which I'll provide additional details on in a moment. Our hospital business continued its recovery. BRIDION sales grew 67% year-over-year, driven by increased surgeries as patient's access to hospitals improved from last year.  Turning to our outlook. the recovery we saw in the quarter gives us confidence that we will have a very strong second half resulting from both market recovery and strong commercial execution.  Over the quarter, Merck quickly pivoted it's focus and resources to patient activation campaigns to ensure that patients are putting their health first and recognize the importance of returning to physicians offices for screenings, early detection, and routine visits.  Our efforts in partnership with public health constituent groups, paired with the continued rollout of COVID -19 vaccinations, has resulted in meaningful improvements in patients accessing healthcare providers.  And in adolescents, we've seen more than one-third of teens in the U.S. vaccinated against COVID-19 with at least 1 dose. We assume that these rapidly growing vaccination rates and continued commercial execution will help to drive a near-normal back-to-school season.  Merck has also shown increased agility and efficiency across our organization. And importantly, we've made improvements that will enable meaningful future growth. Of note, we expect GARDASIL to significantly benefit from increases in productivity across our supply chain, which will allow us to fulfill demand that we were previously unable to supply.  Furthermore, as global demand for GARDASIL continues to outpace supply, our teams have been working to ensure we have the right regulatory approvals, and lead time to appropriately allocate doses to areas of increased demand, particularly as the pandemic continues to force lockdowns in many geographies.  These improvements alone will drive very strong sequential and year-over-year growth for GARDASIL in the back half of the year, especially in ex-U.S. markets such as China. In oncology, we are encouraged by the recovery we've seen to-date, and our overall performance throughout the pandemic.  We remain confident in the underlying demand for our broad and innovative portfolio,, including KEYTRUDA, Lynparza, LENVIMA, and if approved, belzutifan, and expect to drive strong and sustained growth across key tumor types and stages of disease.  Overall, the improvements in patient access we are seeing in major markets gives us increased confidence as we look to the second half of the year. Before I conclude, I would like to mention the strong execution of our commercial colleagues around the world that enabled our Company to drive strong growth in the first half of the year.  All the while, we're working to successfully complete the spin-off of Organon. We are confident that the spin-off results in meaningful benefits to the commercial organization, including the ability to drive even stronger growth through more focused commercial execution.  To close, our business has regained momentum, and we are well-positioned to achieve strong growth in the third and fourth quarters. Our portfolio has rebounded with strength, and demonstrated not only its resiliency, but its value to patients globally. [Indiscernible] confidence in the underlying demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines.  And we look forward to a return to robust long-term demand-driven growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. And what I would say is, one, we're very -- we're excited about the opportunity we have overall for a pneumococcal franchise. To your question on the ACIP, we are waiting to better understand the future recommendations, really, of all the vaccines, PNEUMOVAX, VAXNEUVANCE, and PREVNAR 20.  You saw some of the information that came out in June. At this time, there may be a shift and some preference towards some of the newer pneumococcal vaccines, that they go with an age based recommendation, there are number of populations that they're looking at in their recommendations.  And right now we're focused on really making sure they understand our data and the benefits of our offerings across some are both PNEUMOVAX 23 and VAXNEUVANCE. So if there is some risk to Pneumovax, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how that plays out, but I would also highlight that this is for us expressively VAXNEUVANCE as being talked about in the beginning.  We think we have a very competitive offering in adults. We're very excited about the opportunity we have for pediatrics and you heard being mentioned our 2 Phase III trials in pediatrics as well, as we're continuing to develop V116 aimed for adults and also V117.  When we look at the overall pneumococcal franchise and, I would say, vaccines as a growth pillar for our Company, we're very confident in the continued growth for vaccines for the Company both near-term and in the long-term."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Good morning. Our business delivered meaningful growth in the quarter, driven by strong underlying demand for products across our growth pillars and the continued recovery of the business as patient access improved.  As we exit the quarter, we are confident that our position of financial and operational strength, will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth and meaningful margin expansion, creating value for our shareholders by delivering on our mission to improve the health and wellness to people and animals worldwide.  Now, turning to our second quarter results which reflect Merck on a continuing operations basis. Total Company revenues were $11.4 billion, an increase of 22%, or 19%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange.  Further adjusting for the estimated impact of the pandemic, total revenues grew 8% year-over-year, evidence of the underlying strength of our business. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis.  As Frank highlighted, our Human Health business showed improving momentum, growing 18%, or 6% when adjusted for the estimated impact of the pandemic. Animal Health had an outstanding quarter, increasing 27% driven by very strong global demand across Companion Animal and Livestock, which increased to 38% and 20% respectively.  Animal Health sales grew 19% when adjusted for the estimated pandemic impact. In Companion Animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for vaccines as well as parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products.  Performance in livestock reflects increased global demand across ruminant, swine, and poultry products, along with higher demand for our Animal Health intelligence products. I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis.  Gross margin was 76.5% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.6%, reflecting the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange, pricing pressure, and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix.  Operating expenses increased 13% year-over-year to $4.8 billion, driven largely by higher clinical development costs, increased investment in our early stage pipeline, and high er promotion costs in support of return ed care activities for our key growth drivers.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.6%, an increase of 1.3% from a year ago, driven by these three items last year. Taken together, we are at $1.31 per share, an increase of 27%. Before turning to our 2021 guidance, I want to remind you briefly of the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off of Organon.  With the spin completed, Merck is now a more focused Company and better positioned to unlock the full potential of our growth pillars and drive accelerated profitable growth. We're very excited about our future. And as we look out to 2024, we continue to believe that our revenue potential is underappreciated. Now, for 2021.  Health systems and patients have largely adapted to the impacts of the pandemic and we assume this trend will continue. We are narrowing and raising our expected revenue range to $46.4 billion to $47.4 billion, representing growth of 12% to 14%, including a positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 2% using mid-July rate.  The underlying demand for our growth pillars and our strong commercial execution provides us with confidence that we will continue to see strong momentum throughout the remainder of the year. As such, we expect total revenues to be sequentially higher in each consecutive quarter.  Our gross margin is expected to be between 76% and 77%. We expect operating expenses to grow at a high single-digit rate, driven by increased investment in promotion, and patient activation programs to accelerate our near-term business momentum, and by increased R&D investment, to advance our exciting pipeline to support sustainable long-term revenue growth.  As a reminder, our operating margin from continuing operations will be lower than what they were as a combined Company, as our guidance range implies significant operating leverage in 2021. In addition, we continue to expect operating margins of greater than 42% in 2024, driven by our accelerated revenue growth and disciplined investment in our business.  In other income and expense, we expect expense of approximately $300 million. We expect our full-year tax rate to be between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect non - GAAP EPS to between -- excuse me, to be between $5.47 and $5.57, reflecting growth of 21% to 23%.  This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-July rates. As you consider your models and the allocation of revenues to various products, there were two areas to focus on: GARDASIL and Animal Health.  Frank described the strong acceleration in growth expected in GARDASIL, and we also expect continued momentum in our Animal Health business. Our updated guidance also reflects the benefits of the approval of KEYNOTE-522, and as a reminder, does not include revenues from the potential launch of molnupiravir.  Turning to capital allocation. We received a $9-billion cash distribution from Organon, which we intend to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunities that align with the parameters Rob outlined. In the absence of meaningful business development, we will return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.  We remain committed to investing in support of our key brands, and progressing our innovative pipeline, and we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time. To conclude, as a leaner, more focused, and agile Company, Merck is prepared to capitalize on the meaningful opportunities that lie ahead, and is better equipped to succeed in an ever-changing landscape.  Merck remains in a position of financial and operational strength, which we will leverage to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation for our patients and shareholders. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Louise, this is Caroline. Thank you for your question. First, I'll start with our pipeline is rich. And therefore as a Company, we are focused in growing expenses to support the near-term and long-term opportunities that we have, which will enable us to drive long-term revenue growth.  That said, we are also expecting to drive margin expansion. And that margin expansion will come from a few different factors. It will come through from the revenue growth. It will also come from a change in our product mix.  And it will also come through efficiencies across our business and our commitment to deliver $1.5 billion of operating efficiencies over the 3-year period. Finally, we do expect an increase in margin in 2024 as a result of the step-down of royalties, specific to KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL.  So as I think about margin expansion, our guidance for this year at the midpoint of the range assumes that 2 percentage point increase in margin. And I expect that margin expansion to continue to grow as you look out to the coming year."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. And good morning, everyone. I'm deeply honored to speak to you today in my new role as CEO. Merck is a special Company, and I'm fortunate to be surrounded by talented and dedicated colleagues who are intently focused on bringing important life-enhancing and life-saving medicines and vaccines to people and animals around the world.  This longstanding and unwavering commitment to our mission is real, is tangible, and is what drives us to perform every day. The prioritization of investment in research and development under Ken's leadership, and the focus of resources behind key growth drivers, has put us in a position of strength that I intend to build upon.  As I consider Merck's future, I continue to believe investment in the Research and Development, with patients at the center of everything we do, is core to who Merck is, and is our best path to sustainable, ongoing success and value creation.  However, how we go about both delivering the best external and internal scientific opportunities, as well as how we bring those innovations to patients, must evolve. As I transition to the role of CEO, I solicited candid feedback from colleagues and external stakeholders.  What I heard reaffirms my convictions. There's a broad agreement that investment in R&D should remain our highest strategic priority. Employees are confident that we're on the right path. We have rebuilt and reinvigorated our discovery research engine and have a growing and robust pipeline.  We're successfully executing on clinical development And we're delivering strong commercial growth across both our human and animal health businesses now and will continue to do so, well into the future.  While we are on the right path, we need to work with more speed, urgency, and agility, more closely matching the pace of change in the broader environment. We need to accelerate the delivery of our innovations to the patients who need them, and to be leaner, nimbler, and more digitally-enabled.  We need to leverage the scale and reach we have as a global biopharmaceutical leader, while also embracing in commitment to evolve to address new challenges. And, we need to move with focus and intentionality, which is a priority for both me and my management team.  I know that it's not about promising, it's about performing. Actions speak louder than words. With that understanding, I pledge to do all I can to ensure that Merck remains a global biopharmaceutical leader long into the future, delivering value to current and future patients, and growth and value for our shareholders.  Now, turning to the quarter, we had very good performance with strong growth. Our results demonstrate that the impact of the pandemic on our business is lessening. Patient access to healthcare providers has improved, and we expect continued strong growth in the remainder of the year.  We're also making meaningful clinical advancements, which Dean will speak to in just a few moments. Our seamless execution during a period in which we successfully completed a complex spin-off, without business interruption, underwent leadership transitions and delivered accelerated growth only increases my confidence in what our organization can achieve in the future.  Organon is now an independent Company, an important milestone in our Company's history. And this transaction is a meaningful catalyst to Merck becoming a more focused, more efficient, and faster growing Company.  Let me spend a moment speaking about KEYTRUDA, which again experienced very strong growth this quarter. I'm confident that KEYTRUDA will continue to be a foundational cancer therapy and achieve strong growth for years to come. We are a leader in immuno-oncology, and are determined to leverage this into sustained success.  We are rapidly advancing a diverse set of oncology assets, many of which we highlighted in our recent ASCO investor presentation. Across our oncology portfolio, we expect over 90 potential new indications by 2028, more than tripling our current base.  We have a wide array of clinical partnerships, providing valuable insights into the biology of disease and into important potential external innovation. With our expanding oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA, we will extend our leadership in cancer long into the future.  I also strongly believe we will successfully navigate the eventual KEYTRUDA loss of exclusivity, given the breadth of opportunity in areas both within, as well as outside of oncology. Internally, our leaders are intensely focused on this period and efforts are underway.  Externally, I understand the importance of providing investors with increased transparency into the breadth of opportunities we see in our pipeline that will help us do this.  As we've done recently in highlighting islatravir, our broader HIV portfolio, and our next-generation oncology assets, we're planning deep dive investor events with our scientific and commercial leaders, focused on other areas of our pipeline, that we believe, are underappreciated, yet hold great promise, such as our suite of vaccine candidates, our cardiometabolic assets, as well as others.  Business development plays an important role, and we are putting increased emphasis on ensuring we are appropriately aggressive and accessing the best external science. Executing value-enhancing BD is the top priority, and we intend to add to our pipeline through acquisitions, partnerships, licensing deals and collaborations.  We will be unbounded by therapeutic area, though we are mindful of the need to have a balanced portfolio over time. We'll seek new products, modalities, and platforms that allow us to establish beachheads in important areas. Our recent acquisition of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset is a good example of this.  We will look at both early and late-stage opportunities, and we have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes, particularly given the $9 billion distribution from the Organon spinoff.  And given our strong operational momentum, we are most interested in transactions that are easily integrated and less disruptive, where value is principally derived by the introduction of innovative new products that address patient needs instead of through cost energies.  Before I turn the call over to Frank to discuss second quarter performance in our Human Health business, I want you to know that I appreciate and applaud the increasing societal and investor demands in corporations to act responsibly.  In fact, I believe our strong performance across environmental, social, and governance issues, has and will continue to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Merck has a long track record and history of strong corporate citizenship, and I'm committed to remaining a leader in this area. With that, let me turn the call over to Frank. Sure. Sure. No, I appreciate the question, Chris, and good morning. As we -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we're very focused on business development, and it's something that we recognize we need to do. We need to augment the pipeline.  But I also just want to reinforce, and I think hopefully you heard it through what Dean just walked through, we also have a strong internal pipeline, and I don't want to lose sight of that. And we really do have a lot of confidence in what we can bring forward across the breadth of both oncology assets, as well as assets outside of oncology and vaccines. Obviously in HIV, all the areas that Dean touched upon. But with that said, we know we need to add more and build upon that, and we're very focused there. Clearly, we see ourselves, and I made a comment about this in the prepared remarks, with the strength in oncology.  And we want to build upon that strength and actually see ourselves as a Company that, over time, can be a broad player across oncology, really leveraging the foundational position we have with KEYTRUDA to going well beyond KEYTRUDA, and we're already starting to do that.  As we think about business development, I always will look at that because if you look right now in the space of where there's still one of the largest unmet needs, despite the advances we've made with KEYTRUDA and other new agents, which are phenomenal in what they're delivering for patients, the truth is the majority of patients still don't have a solution yet for the cancers they face.  This is still an area of unmet need. There's a ton of science being done in this area -- focused in this area. And as I said, we have the strength to leverage the position of KEYTRUDA and the data we have within our oncology space, to really be a differentiated, and I think unique observer of the space to be able to select the best opportunity.  So that will be a focus. But I also recognize we have to do more than that, we need to be balanced, and we are looking to areas outside of oncology as well. And I would like to see us do things in both. Build the strong foundation, continue to lead in oncology, leverage the data we have there, but look to where can we balance that, and augment the portfolio on outside areas.  On the second part of the question, on the pros and cons between large and small deals, in a perfect world we would -- where we think we bring the greatest value, is if you get assets that are a little bit earlier in development where we can bring the prowess we have from a clinical side to bring those through and really add value.  Those are the deals we've been doing historically. But we're not foreclosed to doing larger deals. And as we've always said, and I continue to believe, it's more about finding the right science. Driven first was science as the key component, informed by the portfolio impact where we believed we had value.  And if we can find those deals, we will move on them, whether they are large or small. But clearly one of the areas we continue to believe we do not need to go, is to the very large synergy-driven deals.  I think we have enough firepower on our own pipeline. And through what we can add across the portfolio with deals focused on the science, we don't need to go to those large type of deals at this time. Terrence, thanks for the question. As we look forward, we're actively looking and want to move with speed. I don't want to put a time limit on how fast because, obviously, some of it is based on market factors, and where assets are in their own lifecycle, and in discussions we're having.  Right now, we're focused on trying to find the ways to deliver to the pipeline through BD, but it's not timed down. I think what Caroline's really trying to say is, eventually, if we don't find those opportunities, we're not going to sit on the cash forever. But I want to make sure that we put the priority on BD first before we make that determination. And Terrence, my apologies. I recognized I didn't answer the last part of your question on valuations. What we are seeing in the marketplace are things tend to still be fully valued. And as we know, there's a lot of capital flowing into the biotech space.  That obviously presents a challenge, but I would just point to you that we recognize we need to be appropriately aggressive as we go after these opportunities. And I continue to believe that if we apply where we see differential opportunity, based on our scientific read of what's out there, we can still create value while we're strategically adding to the pipeline. And that's really where we're focused. Andrew, we will try to answer the question. To be honest with you, you came through very, very garbled. I think your question -- the first part of the question was about pipeline transparency and when are we going to be showing more information if we're on that. As I said, that is an area of focus.  We did that with what -- when we showed you the broader HIV Portfolio and the work we did recently to give some insights to our broader early-stage oncology portfolio outside of KEYTRUDA. Our thought and thinking is probably, as we approach probably closer to the end of the year, I think we're going to plan to have another session.  And then, obviously, we'll think about as we move into next year. But areas we want to highlight as we move forward, clearly, as I mentioned, cardiometabolic is an area where we have growing conviction and interest.  We're very interested in our broader vaccines portfolio and we see a lot of opportunity there. So those will be some areas where we'll be focusing in the future. And then I think you were asking if we saw a pro-drug IP issue with islatravir. I'll turn that over to Dean if he's aware of -- if I got the question right. Geoff, I appreciate the question. As we think about business development and how we think about that relative to our margin goals we have for the Company, a couple of comments. One, it's important to say we do believe over time, as I said, we need to have a balanced -- more balanced portfolio, and we'd like to bring that diversification.  I would make 1 clarification to your point. I see a difference in diversification away from KEYTRUDA versus diversification away from oncology. Obviously, oncology is a broad field. And as I said it earlier, with huge unmet needs still -- still rests there.  That's an area where we can leverage the strength that we have with KEYTRUDA, the foundational position we have, the data we have, the insights we get from basically being tested, either combined with, or against pretty much every agent out there. And so I see expansion and diversification across broader oncology as an important goal for us future -- into the future.  And then I do believe we also should look for other therapeutic areas. We have a strong position in vaccines. We are looking there. We've mentioned cardiometabolic as an area. And in fact, Dean can make a comment on neuroscience, where we actually have several ongoing early stage programs in the neuroscience space, so we're excited about that.  To your question on what do we prioritize. First and foremost, I prioritize long-term sustainable growth. And that, in our business, is about innovation and investment in science. And so we always will prioritize that. I believe we can both deliver that and bring operating margin expansion to the business. But if it's a matter of driving cost reduction or investing in growth, I always will invest in growth. Yeah. Thank you. I'll take that question. Clearly, we continue to expect to see ongoing pressure on pricing and I think the dialogue that you're pointing to the tapping right now with Congress. And then, also, with the Biden administration only reinforces that that threat continues to be there. But I think as we focus on it, a couple of points.  One, as we look forward, all of the expectations we have for our growth as a Company that we've communicated in the past does assume we face meaningful price pressure. So we continue to believe our growth will be driven more by volumes than price.  And I think that's important as you think about the long-term risk position of the Company. As we look out over the next 5 plus years, we're largely be risked to our revenue goals. And I think we can achieve it regardless of price.  Putting that aside, as you think about it from a policy perspective, we're very willing to engage with the U.S. government in discussions about how best to achieve a goal of reducing the out-of-pocket costs for patients. That is our foremost goal. We actually recognize that need and are willing, and want, to work with them around that goal.  Understanding, we want to protect innovation, because we also want to be able to ensure we can bring the innovations for the next generation of patients that need them. I think the whole situation with COVID has shown why you want a robust and innovative industry because at the moment, you need it.  It's important that it's here in our country and we can invest and drive it. So that's our focus. But again, it's really about where it is that we can see reductions in out-of-pocket cost areas where they look either legislatively or otherwise, that don't shift any kind of savings to the patient in their pocketbook, we're opposed to. Great, Thanks Peter. As we discussed today, hopefully what you get a sense of is that we do have significant opportunities for growth and value creation. I'm committed to make it happen and I know my team is as well, and importantly, we're confident we'll be able to do so.  Merck is a Company that matters. And as we think about that, we know we need to evolve, that we hold a special place in the world and we're committed to delivering for the patients who are counting on us.  And frankly to deliver the sustainable growth that I know our shareholders want to see and I'm confident we will do so. So I look forward to giving you updates on our progress as we move forward, and I wish you all to have a great rest of your day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Lara, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Merck & Co. Q1 sales and earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Lara, and good morning. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2021 Conference Call. Today, I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Davis, our President; Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs; Frank Clyburn, President of Human Health; and Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer.  Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provided a reconciliation in our press release. I would also like to remind you that some of the statements that we make during today's call may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.  If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2020 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our SEC filings, today's earnings release and an investor presentation with highlights of our results are all posted on merck.com.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Frazier: Thank you, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 2021 marks Merck's 130th year, which provides an opportunity to reflect on our company's heritage of bringing forward transformative innovation that changed medical paradigms across many therapeutic areas. Today, we are well positioned to achieve sustained future success given our highly talented employees, our scientific expertise, our promising pipeline and our financial and operational strength. We also are taking the right steps to evolve Merck's operating model to best position the company for the future as the industry landscape continues to evolve.  The upcoming spin-off of Organon will further enhance our focus on innovation and on our key growth drivers, and this will enable necessary investments in cutting-edge science. Merck's leadership progressions have been thoughtfully planned and seamless succession is well underway. Each of our newly appointed leaders have a proven track record of success and embodies the mission of the company. I am confident that this team, led by Rob, is more than ready to take the helm and lead this company into the future.  Reflecting on the results of this quarter. While the pandemic continued to impact both patient access and health care provider capacity to treat, we delivered solid performance, especially considering the high proportion of physician-administered products in our portfolio, particularly on that theme. And speaking of the pandemic, Merck remains committed to the development of molnupiravir as an important potential treatment for COVID-19, and we are proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson on the production of their vaccine.  This will be my final earnings call as CEO before I retire from the role on June 30. I want you to know that I appreciate the helpful and constructive input you all have given me over the year. And I look forward to serving as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and acting in an advisory role and importantly, to watching Merck achieve even greater success.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob Davis.\nRobert Davis: Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This is Ken's 42nd and final earnings call as CEO. And on behalf of all of us here at Merck, we thank him for his profound contributions to this company, to the scientific community and to our customers and patients around the world. We wish him much success and happiness as he embarks on life after his distinguished career as the CEO of Merck, and we look forward to his continuing counsel as he serves as our Executive Chairman.  As I transition to the CEO role, one of my immediate priorities is to ensure that our experienced and empowered leadership team continues building on the strong foundation and positive momentum we have across the company. To that end, I'm very pleased to welcome Caroline Litchfield to the Executive Committee as our new Chief Financial Officer. Caroline most recently served as Merck's Treasurer and prior to this, was Head of Finance for our Human Health business. She's had a distinguished 30-year career at Merck, serving in finance roles across different regions and businesses and is exceptionally well positioned to lead our finance organization and provide strategic insight as a member of our senior leadership team.  I'm also very pleased by the expansion of Frank's role to the President of our Human Health business, including both our commercial and marketing operations. Frank's insight and leadership have been critical drivers of Merck's success over the past decade, particularly as we've built out our oncology business and achieved extraordinary commercial success. In addition, I've been working closely with Dean to ensure that the connection between the commercial and research operations remain strong. R&D is the lifeblood of Merck. And Dean and his team are fully committed to driving scientific innovation and in efficiently allocating resources to our most promising pipeline opportunities.  While our portfolio continues to feel the impacts of the pandemic, we are confident that underlying demand for our products remain strong, and we are optimistic that a more normal environment is beginning to emerge. We've executed important business development transactions this quarter and we made meaningful advancements in our pipeline. Frank, Caroline and Dean will speak to this in a moment, but I'll first give you an update on where I've been focusing during this transition period.  I've been spending a lot of time with the leadership team and many others across the company to ensure we have open lines of communication and a clear path towards continued success. I'm using my time as President to listen to employees throughout the organization to help me flesh out further my own perspectives on our go-forward strategy and to begin to shape our priorities to deliver it. In the meantime, I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to execute on the significant commercial and development opportunities we have in the short term to realize our meaningful growth potential while also taking the necessary steps to transform our operating model to best prepare us for the evolving health care landscape over the long term.  To that end, we will continue to focus on delivering our late-stage pipeline and advancing programs out of our robust and growing early-stage pipeline. And we will continue to augment our efforts through internal business development focused on meaningful asset additions. The acquisitions of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset and the HIV collaboration with Gilead Sciences are great examples of transactions completed this quarter that each has significant value creation potential.  Finally, we will continue to take the necessary steps to help shape Merck into a leaner, more focused and agile company such as the upcoming spin-off we're working on. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day on Monday, during which the full Organon leadership team will highlight its strategy and opportunities for growth. We expect to complete the spin-off on June 2, with trading on the new stock commencing on June 3.  In closing, we remain confident that our business is well positioned for strong long-term growth. Our mission will continue to be the fuel that drives our company forward and gives us purpose. Namely, we will continue to be focused on scientific innovation aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs that improve the lives of the patients we serve. I firmly believe that by keeping patients at the center of everything we do, we create the most value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call to Frank.\nFranklin Clyburn: Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I'm excited to expand my role as President of Human Health and to build on the commercial success we are driving. We are very confident in the underlying demand for our key products and we continue to anticipate strong growth for our business for the full year.  That said, the underlying strength in our Human Health business was impacted this quarter due to the increase in cases and additional lockdowns across the globe. These headwinds were, in part, the continuation of reduced patient access to physician offices and lower-than-normal wellness visits and were more pronounced early in the quarter given the wave of infections that occurred. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations against co-administration have also impacted parts of our vaccine business. As a reminder, roughly 70% of our pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of physician-administered products.  It is important to keep in mind as well that our year-over-year growth was impacted by the particularly strong first quarter we had in 2020, along with quarter-to-quarter variability in sales of GARDASIL. As a result of these factors, our sales were roughly flat compared to last year, or negative 3%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through some of our expectations for future trends in just a moment, but first, I'll turn to the first quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis.  In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 16% to $3.9 billion, reflecting continued strong demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, including capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma or MSI high indication, triple-negative breast cancer as well as the Q 6-week dosing regimen. Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and our ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza grew 51% in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing launches and broader reimbursement that continue to solidify its position as the leading PARP inhibitor. Lenvima was essentially flat, reflecting competitive entrants in hepatocellular carcinoma and a onetime accrual related to the recent NRDL listing for hepatocellular carcinoma in China.  Our vaccine portfolio was impacted by lower-than-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States, along with headwinds related to the rollout of COVID vaccines in adults. GARDASIL sales were negatively impacted by the timing of shipments to China last year and the timing of U.S. public sector purchases in both periods as well as pandemic impacts in the United States and in Europe. PNEUMOVAX sales declined due to a challenging year-over-year comparison given strong demand for pneumococcal vaccination at the start of the pandemic last year and the impact of CDC COVID vaccine coadministration guidelines partially offset by higher ex U.S. sales.  Our hospital business continued its recovery from pandemic impacts. BRIDION sales grew 11% year-over-year driven by broader usage along with updated operating room protocols that allow for more normal levels of elective procedures. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio given the meaningful values of our products to patients. With the strong rollout of the COVID vaccines, we expect that patients will be more comfortable to seek care in a timely manner. In fact, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we saw as we exited the first quarter, with March wellness visits in the United States tracking above prepandemic levels.  In oncology, since the start of the pandemic, there has been an unfortunate reduction in the level of cancer screenings, which has resulted in fewer patient diagnoses and reduced new patient starts for many oncology agents, particularly in areas like lung cancer. With the rollout of the COVID vaccines, especially among the elderly where cancer incidence is highest, along with increased awareness campaigns, we believe screenings and diagnosis will soon return to normal levels. We expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, given its leadership position across many current indications.  In addition, we're excited by the recent launch in esophageal cancer and by potential additional indications in renal cell carcinoma, including in combination with Lenvima and as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In vaccines, the recent improvement in wellness visits is encouraging as our awareness campaigns would help raise the potential for catch-up vaccinations across the portfolio as patient access improves. We expect COVID vaccines to be available in the adolescent population in the future.  And we will monitor the impact on GARDASIL, especially in the back-to-school season. That said, in the United States, in order to enable safe return to in-person learning in the fall, there is heavy attention being put on accelerating adolescents' physician visits to catch up on missed routine vaccinations and to schedule new vaccinations around the COVID vaccine rollout to this cohort. We will also monitor many ex U.S. markets where the rate of COVID vaccination has been slower than in the United States and where there have been renewed lockdowns that are expected to impact physician well visits and school-based vaccination programs. Overall, however, we believe there is strong global demand for GARDASIL, particularly in ex U.S. markets like China. We have seen improvements in our capacity to manufacture this year, which will also benefit our sales. Given this, we expect strong global growth for GARDASIL this year.  To conclude, we are confident in the strength and resilience of our portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines. We expect to return to more normal operations later this year and strong full year growth. There is underlying patient demand for our products, and we believe that once we move through the temporary market dynamics created by the pandemic, our business will resume to a strong growth trajectory long into the future.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone. I am extremely honored to be Merck's new Chief Financial Officer and work more closely with the team of extraordinary leaders who share my deep passion for Merck's mission. I am excited by the opportunity to lead the finance organization and to help ensure that Merck remains well positioned to make the investments in science and innovation necessary to sustain our unique legacy of making a difference in the world and in creating value for patients and shareholders.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year on a nominal basis or down 1% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. These results were broadly in line with our initial expectations. Frank describes the underlying strength in the human health business as well as the ways in which the pandemic affected the quarter, and we estimate the impact was approximately $600 million.  Animal Health delivered a particularly strong quarter, growing 15% year-over-year driven by demand across both companion animal and livestock, which grew 24% and 9%, respectively. In companion animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for our parasiticides, primarily the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as strength in vaccine. Performance in livestock reflects increased demand in international markets across ruminants, poultry and swine as well as strong growth of our Intelligence products.  I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.8%, driven largely by higher costs associated with COVID programs. Operating expenses increased to 10% year-over-year to $4.9 billion driven largely by higher clinical development costs, including our COVID-19 program, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher provision costs in support of key growth drivers. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%, a decrease of 2.8% from a year ago driven by favorable earnings mix and discrete items. Together, we earned $1.40 per share, a decrease of 7%.  Turning to our updated 2021 guidance for Merck, including Organon. First quarter revenues were broadly in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, representing growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020. The underlying strength of our growth pillars provides us with confidence that we will see strong acceleration in revenues throughout the remainder of the year despite a slightly less favorable impact from foreign exchange and a higher projected impact from the pandemic.  Our revenue guidance does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Our gross margin is now expected to be roughly 76%, slightly less than prior guidance as a result of the impact of COVID. We now expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, a lower growth rate compared to our prior guidance largely driven by diligent management of SG&A expenses. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to a mid-single-digit rate. Our guidance for other income and expense, tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from last quarter. Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, reflecting growth of 12% to 15%. This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 3%.  With respect to Organon, on a pro-forma basis, assuming it's operated as an independent company for the full year, Organon is now expected to achieve revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Assuming completion of the spinoff, Merck anticipates full year revenues from continuing operations to be $45.8 billion to $47.8 billion. We continue to expect operating efficiencies enabled by the spin of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including $500 million in 2021.  Due to the high profitability of the Organon products versus overall Merck, we expect Merck's operating margin from continuing operations to be slightly lower in 2021 versus what it would have been without the spin-off but to accelerate and be higher within 12 to 24 months versus where they would have been in the absence of the spin-off and to be greater than 42% in 2024. We remain confident the transaction will benefit the patients that both Merck and Organon serve and create value for shareholders.  Merck expects its revenue and earnings growth rate to be higher after the spin-off. Given the faster growth of Merck and the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, combined with the faster growth we expect the Organon products to achieve in an independent structure, we expect combined EPS of the 2 companies to be higher within 12 to 24 months versus what would have been achieved without the spin.  Upon the close of the Organon spin-off, we expect to receive a special tax-free dividend of $9 billion, which we hope to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunity. In the absence of meaningful business development, we intend to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As always, we remain committed to ensuring appropriate investment in our business, both in support of our key brands but also to drive forward the innovation progressing in our pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time.  In summary, I am excited to embark upon my journey as CFO and to be stepping in at a time in which our company is in such a strong financial position. We remain confident in the outlook of our business. And I look forward to doing my part to ensure Merck remains well positioned financially to drive sustainable value to patients and shareholders.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. For my remarks today, I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates initially in oncology and then in our broader pipeline. And finally, I will discuss recent business development activities.  In the first quarter, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for a new drug application for belzutifan, our investigational HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that we acquired from Peloton for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with a September PDUFA date. We are evaluating this asset further in 3 ongoing Phase III studies in RCC. We initiated a Phase III study evaluating vibostolimab, our investigation on anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor has expressed PD-L1. This is one of several co-formulated assets we are on track to advance this year from our oncology portfolio that builds on the success of KEYTRUDA.  Turning to FDA approvals. KEYTRUDA was indicated in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. This marks the 11th approved indication based on a clinical study that demonstrated overall survival. Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved new indications for KEYTRUDA for adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma based on the results from KEYNOTE-204 and for patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient previously untreated colorectal cancer based on KEYNOTE-177.  Now earlier this month, we announced that following an interim analysis, KEYNOTE-564, our Phase III study evaluating KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. These data will be shared with regulatory authorities and presented at ASCO. This provides another proof point for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, where we expect additional readouts in several other tumor types this year and it also supports our broad development program in patients with renal cell carcinoma.  We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for Q 6-week dosing across KEYTRUDA combination regimens for patients in the EU, which builds upon the 6-week dosing schedule already approved in monotherapy indications. And at the AACR Annual Meeting, initial results from KEYNOTE-555, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma, were presented. We are continuing to study this new formulation and other innovative modes of administration and dosing aimed at providing increased benefit and access for patients.  Along with our partners at Eisai, we presented potentially practice-changing data, demonstrating the benefit of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in second-line advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775, respectively. These studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities on these filings.  In February, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, we announced that following an interim analysis, the Phase III OlympiA trial, studying Lynparza as maintenance therapy in the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA-mutated high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer crossed the superiority boundary for its primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival versus placebo. The trial continues to evaluate the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and distant disease-free survival, and this data will be presented at ASCO. We are also pleased with the positive outcome of yesterday's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee review of our first-line advanced bladder cancer indication and recognition of the efficacy and safety that KEYTRUDA has demonstrated in clinical trials. We look forward to further discussions with the committee on other accelerated approvals under review.  Last month, we announced the decision to voluntarily withdraw an indication for KEYTRUDA for the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer. As announced, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for a supplemental biologics application for KEYTRUDA for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522. We anticipate the next interim analysis from this trial in the third quarter of 2021, and we look forward to further discussions with the FDA.  Now turning to our broader pipeline. On molnupiravir, along with our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced interim results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients. After analysis of the data, we have decided to proceed to Phase III in outpatients with enrollment focused on higher-risk populations. We will be evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option in a study starting later this year. As previously discussed, we have made the decision to discontinue the development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and plan to focus our pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine.  In HIV, we continue to make good progress in our development program for islatravir, our potentially first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Data presented at the CROI meeting last month supports the potential of islatravir in long-acting dosings regimens in both the treatment and in the PrEP settings. Of note was early data supporting the potential for the subdermal islatravir implant to provide drug concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold for at least 1 year.  We are pleased to build upon our legacy of innovation in HIV through our collaboration with Gilead Sciences to co-develop and co-commercialize islatravir and lenacapavir. Both have unique properties that we believe have the potential to enable the creation of effective long-acting oral and injectable regimens that provide important new treatment options and address remaining unmet need for people living with HIV.  Our pneumococcal vaccine, V114, remains on track for potential FDA approval for adults in July and a readout of pediatric data and associated filings by year-end. V114 is the first of a suite of promising pneumococcal vaccine candidates, which also include V116, our adult-focused vaccine, where a readout from our Phase I/II study is expected later this year. Finally, we announced that the FDA accepted our new drug application for gefapixant, a potentially first-in-class P2X3 inhibitor in adult patients with refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The decision is expected in December. This application will be subject of an upcoming advisory committee meeting.  We continue to pursue business development across the most exciting areas of science. Our acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics expands and complements our internal pipeline of candidates targeting autoimmune diseases. Pandion's lead IL-2 candidate has the potential to be meaningfully differentiated based on high selectivity, and we plan to initiate the Phase Ib/II study this year. We continue to make strong progress with the pipeline. This momentum is due to the passion and commitment to the scientists within our research laboratories to bring life-saving medicines and vaccines to patients around the world.  Now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Lara, we're ready for questions, but I'd like to end the call today at 9:00. We ask that questioners limit themselves to one question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: Great. I guess I was just wondering on the KEYTRUDA KEYNOTE-564 study in RCC, if you believe you'll be able to file on disease-free survival. Or if FDA will also require survival data? And then regarding the commercial opportunity here, maybe a question for Frank. I think the current treatment rate here in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting for RCC is around 10% to 15%. Can you give us any thoughts on how much higher that might move if KEYTRUDA is approved here?\nDean Li: So I'll address the KEYNOTE-564 question. In relationship to what the regulatory agencies will accept, we're clearly going to have discussions with them. But the endpoint that we reported is a registrational endpoint. And we hope to have further discussions with the FDA. Clearly, we are advancing the study to do the other endpoints that you outlined in terms of overall survival as well.\nFranklin Clyburn: Okay, Terence, and this is Franklin. The opportunity the majority of renal cell carcinoma patients do present in the adjuvant setting with the remaining in the metastatic setting, so think of it about 75% are presenting at the early stage. So it is a very nice opportunity for us. When we do look at our study, when we see and evaluate the eligible patients, it's probably about even turns between the adjuvant opportunity and metastatic opportunity. But we are very excited about this opportunity, if approved, going forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat: I just wanted to focus on the molnupiravir outpatient trial, if I may. And a couple of pieces to that. One, what percentage of the Phase II portion of this trial had older adults over 60? And I guess what would the Phase III portion -- what percentage of the Phase III has to be older to get to the number of events you have in mind over the target time frame? And also, I know the endpoints' focused on hospitalizations and deaths. But the trial sites are primarily in U.S. and Europe, where there's a lot of vaccination going on. So is there openness to perhaps adding sites like India, et cetera, where hospitalizations are high?\nDean Li: So let me take that question. Thank you very much for that question. We're very confident in our molnupiravir program. As you outlined, we are advancing the outpatient. And I should also say that we are poised to start the Phase III portion of that outpatient study imminently. As you know, this is a global trial with a recruitment strategy focused in areas where we are looking at vaccination rates that are unfortunately low. So we are in Africa, we are in South America. Those will be very important sites. We anticipate that there will be more than 100 sites to contribute. This is a global study.  In terms of your question in relationship with India, we are -- we have entered into a voluntary license agreement with 5 Indian generic manufacturers to expand global access to molnupiravir. At this time, we are not extending our clinical trial for MOVe-OUT into India. And then finally, what I would say is our clinical safety and virologic data gives us great confidence to evaluate molnupiravir, not just in the MOVe-OUT study, but also for postexposure prophylaxis in a study starting later this year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: I just had a two part question on BD. You're getting $9 billion with the Organon spin. The company obviously generates a lot of cash. I guess if we continue the current pace of these tuck-in-type acquisitions, it seems like Merck at some point becomes overcapitalized. So I guess when you look at the BD landscape, are you confident that there are actionable opportunities to deploy this capital into transactions? Or does it reach a point where we need to think about further capital return to shareholders?  And maybe as you talk about the BD landscape and just sort of experience in the -- the environment you're seeing, I guess, is a string of smaller tuck-ins kind of more likely for Merck, given the environment we have? Or is there still the opportunity to think about larger or later-stage acquisitions over the near to intermediate term?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll address the question. As you point out, the company is very well-capitalized, and we are looking forward to getting the $9 billion special dividend as part of the spin-off of Organon. As we look at it, and as Caroline made in her prepared comments, we intend to use that capital both for business development and potentially share repurchase, but our clear priority is business development. We believe that's the most value-enhancing use of our capital, long term.  To the question of whether or not I think there's enough assets out there, there are a lot of opportunities. So our goal is to deploy that capital to BD. And more time will have to pass to be able to see how that evolves. But that is our goal. But to your other question, if we do not ultimately use that capital for business development, I'm not looking to build excess cash or improve our ratings. We would return that to shareholders.  And then to the last part of your question about size, we've been very clear. We are open to any opportunity to add a meaningful asset. Size is not determined by dollars. Size is determined by complexity and the disruption it brings to our business. So as we look at it, we are open to all forms of deals, and we have the capital to go after all forms of deals. We continue to believe where we add a lot of value is in products that are in earlier stages of development, which is what's driven a lot of the deals we've done, but we're not limiting ourselves to that, and we're looking at all opportunity.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Thanks to Ken for the strong leadership within Merck more broadly. And a question for Rob. Our conversations with investors on Merck are surprisingly dominated by the KEYTRUDA concentration risk, particularly post-Organon. My question is do you believe the market is anywhere close to reflecting the revenue potential of the current pipeline products, drugs such as islatravir, belzutifan or TIGIT? Or would Merck ever think about giving an aggregate forecast for the existing pipeline, or even as GSK have intended to do, give a 2030 guidance just to help investors gain some visibility about the ability of Merck to manage the pending LOE associated with KEYTRUDA?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Well, I think to maybe just hit the nail on the head of the first part of your question. I do think that our belief and confidence in the overall value of our pipeline, both what we have in the mid- to late stage, and I can go into more specifics on what that is, as well as in the early stage on top of what we see as continued opportunities to expand in oncology, in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant spaces, in combinations, in co-formulation, if you look at the totality of everything, we continue to believe, and over time, I recognize we're going to have to demonstrate, but we continue to believe that, frankly, The Street is underestimating the potential in our pipeline.  And thus, while we are very aware of the potential LOE of KEYTRUDA, we do not see the cliff in the same way The Street does. I think we're very well positioned with what we have internally to address a meaningful part of that. And then obviously, as we said, we understand we need to continue to be urgent and looking at business development to continue to augment it. But I do think there is a disconnect. And over time, I'm confident we will be able to demonstrate.  As it goes to long-term guidance, I don't want to take a specific position today on whether or not we would ever do that, but I can tell you historically, I do agree with the position Merck has had, which is that can paint you into corners that caused you to make decisions that are not always in the best long-term interest. So I doubt you're going to see us giving 10-year guidance on what you've heard from others. But we'll have to see. I think, though, what is important to understand is I recognize also, though, over time, we're going to have to pull the cover back in a balanced way around our portfolio. I respect our science and I want to make sure we keep the integrity of our science pure, and that's very important. That's who Merck is. But I also understand that there is a balance to give some sense of understanding of what's in the pipeline to share our confidence over time.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Just had a follow-up on molnupiravir. As you guys get closer to the Phase III results, how are you thinking about the commercial picture, assuming that it'll have a rest of world bias, especially given the with case burden in India?  And then when you guys look at the prophylaxis or the outpatient setting, what's the right way to stage patients from either a viral load or inflammation perspective? Just trying to think about the -- as the pandemic moves on, how can you more broadly address the -- maximize the number of patients that you could address?\nDean Li: Yes. That's a great question. This is Dean. I'll try to give a scientific point of view and then I'll now send it to Frank to give a more commercial sort of point of view.  In relationship to molnupiravir, we think we are imminently going to do the Phase III trial in the outpatient setting, as was noted in the previous question. We're tightening up the inclusion criteria, reducing the allowable symptom duration for enrollment to be less than 5 days, and we're trying to enroll patients early in the course of disease who have a high risk for poor outcomes. That includes age and other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. So we think that will be critically important to have a successful and timely trial.  In relationship to the postexposure prophylaxis, there's a number of ways one can design that trial. But if I can just take it as a higher elevation, we think that this MOVe-OUT and the prophylaxis studies is going to be very important, not just for Merck but for the world. As one sees the different places of vaccination, some of it albeit extremely low, it's creating a reservoir for variants -- the ability to have a small molecule that can easily be delivered orally is going to be really important for the world. So that's what we've been focused on.  But let me turn it to Frank to focus on the framework that you've asked in terms of the commercial impact.\nFranklin Clyburn: Yes. I think you covered it well. Obviously, we'll have to see how the endemic phase evolves around the world in vaccination rates, but we see this as a really important therapeutic, to Dean's point, having a small-molecule oral option, especially in many markets outside the U.S. We have significant commercial experience, strong execution in getting our therapeutics vaccines to patients around the world, and that will be a significant focus for us. So we think this is a really important opportunity, especially in markets -- you think about what's happening now in India, but you think about the low- to middle-income countries, you think about what's happening in Europe. So upon -- if we're successful, we think this is a really important opportunity for us as we go forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nAaron Gal: A question over the mRNA technology. Can you let us know a little bit how you're thinking about integrating messenger RNA vaccine technology into your business or not? And can you speak specifically about GARDASIL? And do messenger RNA technology poses a risk to that? Can they reach the necessary polyvalency to develop those vaccines? And it seems to be simply a cheaper way of making the same vaccine from a cheaper cost of manufacturing perspective.\nDean Li: Thank you for that excellent question. This is Dean. Let me give a little bit of framework for the mRNA. I would reemphasize that Merck has been very interested in mRNA and other nucleic acid technology and specifically in the vaccine in mRNA. For the past 5 to 6 years, Merck has partnered with Moderna on vaccines for infectious disease and vaccines for cancer. The validation of the mRNA technology in COVID is impressive and at least, personally, is deserving of admiration and thanks. We continue to be interested in mRNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies, including viral-based platforms, for vaccines.  I would highlight, and specific to your question about GARDASIL, when you have multiple sort of antigens that you have to deliver, I think there is a role for those sort of platforms, protein-based. I think there's going to be many different platforms that need to be done specifically for the vaccine and the threat that you're trying to prevent. So RNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies is important to us, including viral-based platforms. But we also think that broader speaking, there are other protein subunit, other vaccine platforms that will still be relevant moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Luisa Hector from Berenberg.\nLuisa Hector: It's on the PNEUMOVAX franchise, and I just wonder whether we should effectively look at 2020 as a peak for PNEUMOVAX, specifically. And then, how should we think about the competitive landscape here versus your own pipeline suite with V114 emerging very soon and then everything else behind that versus the competitors?\nRobert Davis: Yes. So on PNEUMOVAX, what I would say is that if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, we were down versus prior year because of the strong 2020 and the prioritization of the pneumococcal vaccination. We do anticipate, as you build around the rest of 2021, pneumococcal vaccination will start to be prioritized along with flu vaccinations. So we do anticipate, as you get to the back half of the year, you'll see PNEUMOVAX really have an important role to play.  We have also mentioned that we were supply-constrained as you look at PNEUMOVAX, especially in some of our markets around the world. But overall, we see it as a very important product going forward. As we introduce V114 and V116 and the initial introduction of V114, we still see PNEUMOVAX playing a very important role for pneumococcal disease going forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Truist.\nGregory Gilbert: Ken, good luck and hope to see in Happy Valley from time to time. And for Rob, we've heard from Merck how the Organon spin will benefit Merck in terms of complexity and focus. But what are some of the tangible things Merck has done to set up that spin for success beyond the obvious stuff? And I realize we're going to hear more on Monday, but I know you've been familiar with separations in the past. So curious what some of those less obvious features are that you think Organon is poised to benefit from.\nRobert Davis: Well, as you look and, again, just to reiterate what you just commented, on our call on Monday is really solely focused on building out and helping explain the growth story for Organon. But if you look at where Merck has been over the last few years, we've been in a situation where we've been blessed with the benefits of what KEYTRUDA has been able to do. That has required us to do heavy investments to build out our oncology platform, to invest in the clinical studies for oncology and now more broadly, as we look at all of what we have going on in vaccines and even now with this islatravir in infectious diseases. So the challenge has been, in new ways, we had to prioritize, and we made a decision to deprioritize some of the assets that fit within the Organon portfolio. Many of those are still very good assets. And as you know, particularly in the women's health area, an opportunity for real growth.  So I believe through focus, through being able to actually drive their own capital allocation aimed at building those businesses and the focus they'll be able to bring, they will accelerate the growth across, not only the women's health business, but excitement around what they have in their biosimilars business. And then there are several areas, if you look that they'll highlight next week where I think they can get to a point of growth. So a lot of it is really about focus and capital allocation in a way that we haven't been able to do. While on our side, we believe with the spin, the simplification it brings will allow us to go after a lot of -- and I've talked about this in the past, a lot of the, as I've called it, if you will, think of it as the muscle. The fat that is chewing throughout the muscle in this company, given the complexity of our structure that's been built up over time, looking at those areas that sit between our divisions, as we think about manufacturing and commercial, as we think about supply chain and all of those are opportunities for us to simplify and to take out unneeded bureaucratic complexity, that simplification and focus will allow us to bring more resources to bear against our innovative portfolio and to drive faster growth that Caroline commented on.  So I think both businesses, you're going to see grow better as independent businesses than they would as a combined entity, and I'm confident in the story for both. And frankly, I'm excited about having a women's-health-focused business at this time in where we are as a society. I think there's a real opportunity for us to lead there. And that's what I'm looking forward to see Organon do.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: So just wanted to follow up on the 2024 42% operating margin target. Hoping you could just walk us through the pushes and pulls as it relates to the reduced royalty burdens as well as what's happening with the REMICADE, SIMPONI agreement at that point in time. I know that comes with a very high royalty burden as well. And it was our understanding that there are several sunsets in that period that will bolster margin meaningfully without necessarily coming from top line leverage.  And then separately, a question as it relates to the type of business development that's occurring. Just wanted to get a better sense of when you feel we're really going to start to see some of the various smaller tuck-in deals start to produce data that's, let's call it, Phase II compelling from the earlier-stage deals that are really going to drive the next leg of growth. Is that sort of in a similar 2024, 2025 time frame? It's just that the visibility on the pipeline currently to The Street remains, I think, relatively modest.\nRobert Davis: Caroline?\nCaroline Litchfield: Seamus, thank you for the question. Let me first start with the near term. Our company's guidance for this year implies margins of 38%, a growth of 120 basis points compared with last year, and we're driving that growth as a result of the strong revenue and mix of revenue in our business as well as continued diligent but focused investments within our business. As we look out over the coming years, we will see margin improvement as a result of the $1.5 billion of productivity we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, and we are well on track towards that with $500 million included in 2021. As we move forward over time, the real strength for operating margin for Merck will primarily come from the growth opportunities we have with our assets in oncology, in vaccines. In addition, you will see continued investment in our business, but we are confident in achieving the 42%.  As you note, we also have the tailwind of a step down in the royalty rate as it pertains to KEYTRUDA and actually GARDASIL, and that will help in the achievement of the 42%, which we are very confident in. As it pertains to the product mix over time, our company has been diligent and focused in the types of business development we are doing. And Peloton is an ideal example, where we have the opportunity to see the fruit of that impact the top line of our company therefore, the bottom line, as well as support the patients that we serve. Your final point on REMICADE or SIMPONI, it's really not a major contributor to that bottom line expansion.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Dean, Rob, anything else to add there?\nRobert Davis: Maybe I'll just start, and then I'll turn it over to Dean. As you look at the opportunities, I do think you're going to see, in that '24 to '25 time frame, more information. The best example you can look at is what's happened with Peloton. And most recently, we're already seeing HIF-2 alpha move forward in important ways. There's many data coming out on that and see that as a meaningful opportunity.  But maybe I'll turn it to Dean to give a sense because I do believe you are going to see more information as we get in the time frame you're talking about from a lot of these business development deals, given the nature of a lot of the oncology assets.\nDean Li: Yes. Thank you for that question. Let me just take a high level and then answer the temporal question that was asked. The sort of opportunities that we look for, both in our internal pipeline and external pipeline, we like -- or I like assets that give me concentration leverage, foundational drugs where clear monotherapy efficacy gives me a fulcrum for combination. And specifically in relationship to cancer, that allows us to expand, deepen and extend. And as we look for these foundational medicines and the recent discussions with Gilead and Pandion, it just shows that, that sort of attitude of how we want to sort of proceed where we're taking foundational medicines and we're matching them with internal and external pipeline so that we can diversify the pipeline.  And specific to your question, I would look at the '21 to '24 range. There's a whole slew of Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA study that you will see, a lot of it driving to adjuvant at earlier stages. I think there's at least 20 registrational trials. I sort of laid out maybe 4 or so that you'll see in the next year. In relationship to the business development, what you will see is in the '24, '25 time frame, things like the islatravir, Tilos, Seagen, that was also CTLA-4, LAG-3 TIGIT, all of them will be in striking range to not just see sort of Phase II studies but potentially interim analysis or even complete analysis of those assets in that time frame. So you'll see these different ways going through.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, everybody. We're right at the top of the hour. We appreciate the questions this morning and the discussion, and we look forward to any follow-ups in the coming days. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, presenters. And again, thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe. Have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone. I am extremely honored to be Merck's new Chief Financial Officer and work more closely with the team of extraordinary leaders who share my deep passion for Merck's mission. I am excited by the opportunity to lead the finance organization and to help ensure that Merck remains well positioned to make the investments in science and innovation necessary to sustain our unique legacy of making a difference in the world and in creating value for patients and shareholders.  Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $12.1 billion in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year on a nominal basis or down 1% excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. These results were broadly in line with our initial expectations. Frank describes the underlying strength in the human health business as well as the ways in which the pandemic affected the quarter, and we estimate the impact was approximately $600 million.  Animal Health delivered a particularly strong quarter, growing 15% year-over-year driven by demand across both companion animal and livestock, which grew 24% and 9%, respectively. In companion animal, growth was driven by higher global demand for our parasiticides, primarily the BRAVECTO line of products, as well as strength in vaccine. Performance in livestock reflects increased demand in international markets across ruminants, poultry and swine as well as strong growth of our Intelligence products.  I'll now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7% in the quarter, a decrease of 0.8%, driven largely by higher costs associated with COVID programs. Operating expenses increased to 10% year-over-year to $4.9 billion driven largely by higher clinical development costs, including our COVID-19 program, increased investment in our early-stage pipeline and higher provision costs in support of key growth drivers. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%, a decrease of 2.8% from a year ago driven by favorable earnings mix and discrete items. Together, we earned $1.40 per share, a decrease of 7%.  Turning to our updated 2021 guidance for Merck, including Organon. First quarter revenues were broadly in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect revenues of $51.8 billion to $53.8 billion, representing growth of 8% to 12% versus 2020. The underlying strength of our growth pillars provides us with confidence that we will see strong acceleration in revenues throughout the remainder of the year despite a slightly less favorable impact from foreign exchange and a higher projected impact from the pandemic.  Our revenue guidance does not include revenue from the potential launch of molnupiravir. Our gross margin is now expected to be roughly 76%, slightly less than prior guidance as a result of the impact of COVID. We now expect operating expenses to grow at a mid- to high single-digit rate, a lower growth rate compared to our prior guidance largely driven by diligent management of SG&A expenses. Normalized for the impact of COVID, operating expenses would be expected to grow closer to a mid-single-digit rate. Our guidance for other income and expense, tax rate and shares outstanding remain unchanged from last quarter. Taken together, we continue to expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $6.48 to $6.68, reflecting growth of 12% to 15%. This range includes the positive impact from foreign exchange of less than 3%.  With respect to Organon, on a pro-forma basis, assuming it's operated as an independent company for the full year, Organon is now expected to achieve revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.4 billion. Assuming completion of the spinoff, Merck anticipates full year revenues from continuing operations to be $45.8 billion to $47.8 billion. We continue to expect operating efficiencies enabled by the spin of approximately $1.5 billion over 3 years, including $500 million in 2021.  Due to the high profitability of the Organon products versus overall Merck, we expect Merck's operating margin from continuing operations to be slightly lower in 2021 versus what it would have been without the spin-off but to accelerate and be higher within 12 to 24 months versus where they would have been in the absence of the spin-off and to be greater than 42% in 2024. We remain confident the transaction will benefit the patients that both Merck and Organon serve and create value for shareholders.  Merck expects its revenue and earnings growth rate to be higher after the spin-off. Given the faster growth of Merck and the operating efficiencies we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, combined with the faster growth we expect the Organon products to achieve in an independent structure, we expect combined EPS of the 2 companies to be higher within 12 to 24 months versus what would have been achieved without the spin.  Upon the close of the Organon spin-off, we expect to receive a special tax-free dividend of $9 billion, which we hope to deploy in value-enhancing strategic business development opportunity. In the absence of meaningful business development, we intend to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. As always, we remain committed to ensuring appropriate investment in our business, both in support of our key brands but also to drive forward the innovation progressing in our pipeline. And we will look to increase our dividend payout ratio over time.  In summary, I am excited to embark upon my journey as CFO and to be stepping in at a time in which our company is in such a strong financial position. We remain confident in the outlook of our business. And I look forward to doing my part to ensure Merck remains well positioned financially to drive sustainable value to patients and shareholders.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Seamus, thank you for the question. Let me first start with the near term. Our company's guidance for this year implies margins of 38%, a growth of 120 basis points compared with last year, and we're driving that growth as a result of the strong revenue and mix of revenue in our business as well as continued diligent but focused investments within our business. As we look out over the coming years, we will see margin improvement as a result of the $1.5 billion of productivity we expect to achieve as a result of the spin, and we are well on track towards that with $500 million included in 2021. As we move forward over time, the real strength for operating margin for Merck will primarily come from the growth opportunities we have with our assets in oncology, in vaccines. In addition, you will see continued investment in our business, but we are confident in achieving the 42%.  As you note, we also have the tailwind of a step down in the royalty rate as it pertains to KEYTRUDA and actually GARDASIL, and that will help in the achievement of the 42%, which we are very confident in. As it pertains to the product mix over time, our company has been diligent and focused in the types of business development we are doing. And Peloton is an ideal example, where we have the opportunity to see the fruit of that impact the top line of our company therefore, the bottom line, as well as support the patients that we serve. Your final point on REMICADE or SIMPONI, it's really not a major contributor to that bottom line expansion."

            "content": "Thank you, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. 2021 marks Merck's 130th year, which provides an opportunity to reflect on our company's heritage of bringing forward transformative innovation that changed medical paradigms across many therapeutic areas. Today, we are well positioned to achieve sustained future success given our highly talented employees, our scientific expertise, our promising pipeline and our financial and operational strength. We also are taking the right steps to evolve Merck's operating model to best position the company for the future as the industry landscape continues to evolve.  The upcoming spin-off of Organon will further enhance our focus on innovation and on our key growth drivers, and this will enable necessary investments in cutting-edge science. Merck's leadership progressions have been thoughtfully planned and seamless succession is well underway. Each of our newly appointed leaders have a proven track record of success and embodies the mission of the company. I am confident that this team, led by Rob, is more than ready to take the helm and lead this company into the future.  Reflecting on the results of this quarter. While the pandemic continued to impact both patient access and health care provider capacity to treat, we delivered solid performance, especially considering the high proportion of physician-administered products in our portfolio, particularly on that theme. And speaking of the pandemic, Merck remains committed to the development of molnupiravir as an important potential treatment for COVID-19, and we are proud to partner with Johnson & Johnson on the production of their vaccine.  This will be my final earnings call as CEO before I retire from the role on June 30. I want you to know that I appreciate the helpful and constructive input you all have given me over the year. And I look forward to serving as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and acting in an advisory role and importantly, to watching Merck achieve even greater success.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob Davis."

            "name": "Franklin Clyburn",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Good morning. I'm excited to expand my role as President of Human Health and to build on the commercial success we are driving. We are very confident in the underlying demand for our key products and we continue to anticipate strong growth for our business for the full year.  That said, the underlying strength in our Human Health business was impacted this quarter due to the increase in cases and additional lockdowns across the globe. These headwinds were, in part, the continuation of reduced patient access to physician offices and lower-than-normal wellness visits and were more pronounced early in the quarter given the wave of infections that occurred. The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines and recommendations against co-administration have also impacted parts of our vaccine business. As a reminder, roughly 70% of our pharmaceutical revenue is comprised of physician-administered products.  It is important to keep in mind as well that our year-over-year growth was impacted by the particularly strong first quarter we had in 2020, along with quarter-to-quarter variability in sales of GARDASIL. As a result of these factors, our sales were roughly flat compared to last year, or negative 3%, excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange. I'll walk you through some of our expectations for future trends in just a moment, but first, I'll turn to the first quarter performance of our key brands. My comments will be on an ex exchange basis.  In oncology, KEYTRUDA sales grew 16% to $3.9 billion, reflecting continued strong demand. In the United States, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in lung cancer, including capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients and is benefiting from strong usage across all key tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma, bladder, adjuvant melanoma or MSI high indication, triple-negative breast cancer as well as the Q 6-week dosing regimen. Outside the United States, growth continues to be driven by lung cancer indications and our ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma.  Lynparza grew 51% in the quarter, benefiting from ongoing launches and broader reimbursement that continue to solidify its position as the leading PARP inhibitor. Lenvima was essentially flat, reflecting competitive entrants in hepatocellular carcinoma and a onetime accrual related to the recent NRDL listing for hepatocellular carcinoma in China.  Our vaccine portfolio was impacted by lower-than-normal wellness visits, particularly in the United States, along with headwinds related to the rollout of COVID vaccines in adults. GARDASIL sales were negatively impacted by the timing of shipments to China last year and the timing of U.S. public sector purchases in both periods as well as pandemic impacts in the United States and in Europe. PNEUMOVAX sales declined due to a challenging year-over-year comparison given strong demand for pneumococcal vaccination at the start of the pandemic last year and the impact of CDC COVID vaccine coadministration guidelines partially offset by higher ex U.S. sales.  Our hospital business continued its recovery from pandemic impacts. BRIDION sales grew 11% year-over-year driven by broader usage along with updated operating room protocols that allow for more normal levels of elective procedures. We remain confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio given the meaningful values of our products to patients. With the strong rollout of the COVID vaccines, we expect that patients will be more comfortable to seek care in a timely manner. In fact, we are encouraged by the recovery trends we saw as we exited the first quarter, with March wellness visits in the United States tracking above prepandemic levels.  In oncology, since the start of the pandemic, there has been an unfortunate reduction in the level of cancer screenings, which has resulted in fewer patient diagnoses and reduced new patient starts for many oncology agents, particularly in areas like lung cancer. With the rollout of the COVID vaccines, especially among the elderly where cancer incidence is highest, along with increased awareness campaigns, we believe screenings and diagnosis will soon return to normal levels. We expect continued strong growth of KEYTRUDA, given its leadership position across many current indications.  In addition, we're excited by the recent launch in esophageal cancer and by potential additional indications in renal cell carcinoma, including in combination with Lenvima and as monotherapy in the adjuvant setting. In vaccines, the recent improvement in wellness visits is encouraging as our awareness campaigns would help raise the potential for catch-up vaccinations across the portfolio as patient access improves. We expect COVID vaccines to be available in the adolescent population in the future.  And we will monitor the impact on GARDASIL, especially in the back-to-school season. That said, in the United States, in order to enable safe return to in-person learning in the fall, there is heavy attention being put on accelerating adolescents' physician visits to catch up on missed routine vaccinations and to schedule new vaccinations around the COVID vaccine rollout to this cohort. We will also monitor many ex U.S. markets where the rate of COVID vaccination has been slower than in the United States and where there have been renewed lockdowns that are expected to impact physician well visits and school-based vaccination programs. Overall, however, we believe there is strong global demand for GARDASIL, particularly in ex U.S. markets like China. We have seen improvements in our capacity to manufacture this year, which will also benefit our sales. Given this, we expect strong global growth for GARDASIL this year.  To conclude, we are confident in the strength and resilience of our portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines. We expect to return to more normal operations later this year and strong full year growth. There is underlying patient demand for our products, and we believe that once we move through the temporary market dynamics created by the pandemic, our business will resume to a strong growth trajectory long into the future.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Okay, Terence, and this is Franklin. The opportunity the majority of renal cell carcinoma patients do present in the adjuvant setting with the remaining in the metastatic setting, so think of it about 75% are presenting at the early stage. So it is a very nice opportunity for us. When we do look at our study, when we see and evaluate the eligible patients, it's probably about even turns between the adjuvant opportunity and metastatic opportunity. But we are very excited about this opportunity, if approved, going forward. Yes. I think you covered it well. Obviously, we'll have to see how the endemic phase evolves around the world in vaccination rates, but we see this as a really important therapeutic, to Dean's point, having a small-molecule oral option, especially in many markets outside the U.S. We have significant commercial experience, strong execution in getting our therapeutics vaccines to patients around the world, and that will be a significant focus for us. So we think this is a really important opportunity, especially in markets -- you think about what's happening now in India, but you think about the low- to middle-income countries, you think about what's happening in Europe. So upon -- if we're successful, we think this is a really important opportunity for us as we go forward."

            "name": "Robert Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. This is Ken's 42nd and final earnings call as CEO. And on behalf of all of us here at Merck, we thank him for his profound contributions to this company, to the scientific community and to our customers and patients around the world. We wish him much success and happiness as he embarks on life after his distinguished career as the CEO of Merck, and we look forward to his continuing counsel as he serves as our Executive Chairman.  As I transition to the CEO role, one of my immediate priorities is to ensure that our experienced and empowered leadership team continues building on the strong foundation and positive momentum we have across the company. To that end, I'm very pleased to welcome Caroline Litchfield to the Executive Committee as our new Chief Financial Officer. Caroline most recently served as Merck's Treasurer and prior to this, was Head of Finance for our Human Health business. She's had a distinguished 30-year career at Merck, serving in finance roles across different regions and businesses and is exceptionally well positioned to lead our finance organization and provide strategic insight as a member of our senior leadership team.  I'm also very pleased by the expansion of Frank's role to the President of our Human Health business, including both our commercial and marketing operations. Frank's insight and leadership have been critical drivers of Merck's success over the past decade, particularly as we've built out our oncology business and achieved extraordinary commercial success. In addition, I've been working closely with Dean to ensure that the connection between the commercial and research operations remain strong. R&D is the lifeblood of Merck. And Dean and his team are fully committed to driving scientific innovation and in efficiently allocating resources to our most promising pipeline opportunities.  While our portfolio continues to feel the impacts of the pandemic, we are confident that underlying demand for our products remain strong, and we are optimistic that a more normal environment is beginning to emerge. We've executed important business development transactions this quarter and we made meaningful advancements in our pipeline. Frank, Caroline and Dean will speak to this in a moment, but I'll first give you an update on where I've been focusing during this transition period.  I've been spending a lot of time with the leadership team and many others across the company to ensure we have open lines of communication and a clear path towards continued success. I'm using my time as President to listen to employees throughout the organization to help me flesh out further my own perspectives on our go-forward strategy and to begin to shape our priorities to deliver it. In the meantime, I'm focused on ensuring that we continue to execute on the significant commercial and development opportunities we have in the short term to realize our meaningful growth potential while also taking the necessary steps to transform our operating model to best prepare us for the evolving health care landscape over the long term.  To that end, we will continue to focus on delivering our late-stage pipeline and advancing programs out of our robust and growing early-stage pipeline. And we will continue to augment our efforts through internal business development focused on meaningful asset additions. The acquisitions of Pandion and its potentially foundational immunology asset and the HIV collaboration with Gilead Sciences are great examples of transactions completed this quarter that each has significant value creation potential.  Finally, we will continue to take the necessary steps to help shape Merck into a leaner, more focused and agile company such as the upcoming spin-off we're working on. We look forward to hosting an Investor Day on Monday, during which the full Organon leadership team will highlight its strategy and opportunities for growth. We expect to complete the spin-off on June 2, with trading on the new stock commencing on June 3.  In closing, we remain confident that our business is well positioned for strong long-term growth. Our mission will continue to be the fuel that drives our company forward and gives us purpose. Namely, we will continue to be focused on scientific innovation aimed at addressing significant unmet medical needs that improve the lives of the patients we serve. I firmly believe that by keeping patients at the center of everything we do, we create the most value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call to Frank. Yes. Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll address the question. As you point out, the company is very well-capitalized, and we are looking forward to getting the $9 billion special dividend as part of the spin-off of Organon. As we look at it, and as Caroline made in her prepared comments, we intend to use that capital both for business development and potentially share repurchase, but our clear priority is business development. We believe that's the most value-enhancing use of our capital, long term.  To the question of whether or not I think there's enough assets out there, there are a lot of opportunities. So our goal is to deploy that capital to BD. And more time will have to pass to be able to see how that evolves. But that is our goal. But to your other question, if we do not ultimately use that capital for business development, I'm not looking to build excess cash or improve our ratings. We would return that to shareholders.  And then to the last part of your question about size, we've been very clear. We are open to any opportunity to add a meaningful asset. Size is not determined by dollars. Size is determined by complexity and the disruption it brings to our business. So as we look at it, we are open to all forms of deals, and we have the capital to go after all forms of deals. We continue to believe where we add a lot of value is in products that are in earlier stages of development, which is what's driven a lot of the deals we've done, but we're not limiting ourselves to that, and we're looking at all opportunity. Yes. Well, I think to maybe just hit the nail on the head of the first part of your question. I do think that our belief and confidence in the overall value of our pipeline, both what we have in the mid- to late stage, and I can go into more specifics on what that is, as well as in the early stage on top of what we see as continued opportunities to expand in oncology, in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant spaces, in combinations, in co-formulation, if you look at the totality of everything, we continue to believe, and over time, I recognize we're going to have to demonstrate, but we continue to believe that, frankly, The Street is underestimating the potential in our pipeline.  And thus, while we are very aware of the potential LOE of KEYTRUDA, we do not see the cliff in the same way The Street does. I think we're very well positioned with what we have internally to address a meaningful part of that. And then obviously, as we said, we understand we need to continue to be urgent and looking at business development to continue to augment it. But I do think there is a disconnect. And over time, I'm confident we will be able to demonstrate.  As it goes to long-term guidance, I don't want to take a specific position today on whether or not we would ever do that, but I can tell you historically, I do agree with the position Merck has had, which is that can paint you into corners that caused you to make decisions that are not always in the best long-term interest. So I doubt you're going to see us giving 10-year guidance on what you've heard from others. But we'll have to see. I think, though, what is important to understand is I recognize also, though, over time, we're going to have to pull the cover back in a balanced way around our portfolio. I respect our science and I want to make sure we keep the integrity of our science pure, and that's very important. That's who Merck is. But I also understand that there is a balance to give some sense of understanding of what's in the pipeline to share our confidence over time. Yes. So on PNEUMOVAX, what I would say is that if you look at what happened in the first quarter of this year, we were down versus prior year because of the strong 2020 and the prioritization of the pneumococcal vaccination. We do anticipate, as you build around the rest of 2021, pneumococcal vaccination will start to be prioritized along with flu vaccinations. So we do anticipate, as you get to the back half of the year, you'll see PNEUMOVAX really have an important role to play.  We have also mentioned that we were supply-constrained as you look at PNEUMOVAX, especially in some of our markets around the world. But overall, we see it as a very important product going forward. As we introduce V114 and V116 and the initial introduction of V114, we still see PNEUMOVAX playing a very important role for pneumococcal disease going forward. Well, as you look and, again, just to reiterate what you just commented, on our call on Monday is really solely focused on building out and helping explain the growth story for Organon. But if you look at where Merck has been over the last few years, we've been in a situation where we've been blessed with the benefits of what KEYTRUDA has been able to do. That has required us to do heavy investments to build out our oncology platform, to invest in the clinical studies for oncology and now more broadly, as we look at all of what we have going on in vaccines and even now with this islatravir in infectious diseases. So the challenge has been, in new ways, we had to prioritize, and we made a decision to deprioritize some of the assets that fit within the Organon portfolio. Many of those are still very good assets. And as you know, particularly in the women's health area, an opportunity for real growth.  So I believe through focus, through being able to actually drive their own capital allocation aimed at building those businesses and the focus they'll be able to bring, they will accelerate the growth across, not only the women's health business, but excitement around what they have in their biosimilars business. And then there are several areas, if you look that they'll highlight next week where I think they can get to a point of growth. So a lot of it is really about focus and capital allocation in a way that we haven't been able to do. While on our side, we believe with the spin, the simplification it brings will allow us to go after a lot of -- and I've talked about this in the past, a lot of the, as I've called it, if you will, think of it as the muscle. The fat that is chewing throughout the muscle in this company, given the complexity of our structure that's been built up over time, looking at those areas that sit between our divisions, as we think about manufacturing and commercial, as we think about supply chain and all of those are opportunities for us to simplify and to take out unneeded bureaucratic complexity, that simplification and focus will allow us to bring more resources to bear against our innovative portfolio and to drive faster growth that Caroline commented on.  So I think both businesses, you're going to see grow better as independent businesses than they would as a combined entity, and I'm confident in the story for both. And frankly, I'm excited about having a women's-health-focused business at this time in where we are as a society. I think there's a real opportunity for us to lead there. And that's what I'm looking forward to see Organon do. Caroline? Maybe I'll just start, and then I'll turn it over to Dean. As you look at the opportunities, I do think you're going to see, in that '24 to '25 time frame, more information. The best example you can look at is what's happened with Peloton. And most recently, we're already seeing HIF-2 alpha move forward in important ways. There's many data coming out on that and see that as a meaningful opportunity.  But maybe I'll turn it to Dean to give a sense because I do believe you are going to see more information as we get in the time frame you're talking about from a lot of these business development deals, given the nature of a lot of the oncology assets."

            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. For my remarks today, I will cover key regulatory milestones and clinical updates initially in oncology and then in our broader pipeline. And finally, I will discuss recent business development activities.  In the first quarter, the FDA accepted and granted priority review for a new drug application for belzutifan, our investigational HIF-2 alpha inhibitor that we acquired from Peloton for the treatment of certain patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated renal cell carcinoma with a September PDUFA date. We are evaluating this asset further in 3 ongoing Phase III studies in RCC. We initiated a Phase III study evaluating vibostolimab, our investigation on anti-TIGIT antibody in combination with KEYTRUDA in patients with non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor has expressed PD-L1. This is one of several co-formulated assets we are on track to advance this year from our oncology portfolio that builds on the success of KEYTRUDA.  Turning to FDA approvals. KEYTRUDA was indicated in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of certain patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma regardless of PD-L1 expression based on KEYNOTE-590. This marks the 11th approved indication based on a clinical study that demonstrated overall survival. Now outside the United States, the European Commission approved new indications for KEYTRUDA for adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma based on the results from KEYNOTE-204 and for patients with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient previously untreated colorectal cancer based on KEYNOTE-177.  Now earlier this month, we announced that following an interim analysis, KEYNOTE-564, our Phase III study evaluating KEYTRUDA as an adjuvant monotherapy treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma met its primary endpoint of disease-free survival. These data will be shared with regulatory authorities and presented at ASCO. This provides another proof point for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in earlier lines of therapy, where we expect additional readouts in several other tumor types this year and it also supports our broad development program in patients with renal cell carcinoma.  We recently received a positive opinion from the CHMP for Q 6-week dosing across KEYTRUDA combination regimens for patients in the EU, which builds upon the 6-week dosing schedule already approved in monotherapy indications. And at the AACR Annual Meeting, initial results from KEYNOTE-555, evaluating a subcutaneous formulation of KEYTRUDA in patients with metastatic melanoma, were presented. We are continuing to study this new formulation and other innovative modes of administration and dosing aimed at providing increased benefit and access for patients.  Along with our partners at Eisai, we presented potentially practice-changing data, demonstrating the benefit of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and in second-line advanced endometrial carcinoma based on results from KEYNOTE-581 and KEYNOTE-775, respectively. These studies demonstrated statistically significant improvements across primary and secondary endpoints, and we look forward to working with global regulatory authorities on these filings.  In February, in collaboration with AstraZeneca, we announced that following an interim analysis, the Phase III OlympiA trial, studying Lynparza as maintenance therapy in the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with germline BRCA-mutated high-risk HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer crossed the superiority boundary for its primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival versus placebo. The trial continues to evaluate the dual primary endpoints of overall survival and distant disease-free survival, and this data will be presented at ASCO. We are also pleased with the positive outcome of yesterday's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee review of our first-line advanced bladder cancer indication and recognition of the efficacy and safety that KEYTRUDA has demonstrated in clinical trials. We look forward to further discussions with the committee on other accelerated approvals under review.  Last month, we announced the decision to voluntarily withdraw an indication for KEYTRUDA for the third-line treatment of patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer. As announced, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for a supplemental biologics application for KEYTRUDA for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522. We anticipate the next interim analysis from this trial in the third quarter of 2021, and we look forward to further discussions with the FDA.  Now turning to our broader pipeline. On molnupiravir, along with our partners at Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, we announced interim results from the dose-finding phase of Phase II/III studies in both outpatient and hospitalized patients. After analysis of the data, we have decided to proceed to Phase III in outpatients with enrollment focused on higher-risk populations. We will be evaluating molnupiravir as a postexposure prophylactic option in a study starting later this year. As previously discussed, we have made the decision to discontinue the development of MK-7110 for COVID-19 and plan to focus our pandemic efforts on advancing molnupiravir and on producing Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine.  In HIV, we continue to make good progress in our development program for islatravir, our potentially first-in-class nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor. Data presented at the CROI meeting last month supports the potential of islatravir in long-acting dosings regimens in both the treatment and in the PrEP settings. Of note was early data supporting the potential for the subdermal islatravir implant to provide drug concentrations above the target pharmacokinetic threshold for at least 1 year.  We are pleased to build upon our legacy of innovation in HIV through our collaboration with Gilead Sciences to co-develop and co-commercialize islatravir and lenacapavir. Both have unique properties that we believe have the potential to enable the creation of effective long-acting oral and injectable regimens that provide important new treatment options and address remaining unmet need for people living with HIV.  Our pneumococcal vaccine, V114, remains on track for potential FDA approval for adults in July and a readout of pediatric data and associated filings by year-end. V114 is the first of a suite of promising pneumococcal vaccine candidates, which also include V116, our adult-focused vaccine, where a readout from our Phase I/II study is expected later this year. Finally, we announced that the FDA accepted our new drug application for gefapixant, a potentially first-in-class P2X3 inhibitor in adult patients with refractory and unexplained chronic cough. The decision is expected in December. This application will be subject of an upcoming advisory committee meeting.  We continue to pursue business development across the most exciting areas of science. Our acquisition of Pandion Therapeutics expands and complements our internal pipeline of candidates targeting autoimmune diseases. Pandion's lead IL-2 candidate has the potential to be meaningfully differentiated based on high selectivity, and we plan to initiate the Phase Ib/II study this year. We continue to make strong progress with the pipeline. This momentum is due to the passion and commitment to the scientists within our research laboratories to bring life-saving medicines and vaccines to patients around the world.  Now I will turn the call back to Peter. So I'll address the KEYNOTE-564 question. In relationship to what the regulatory agencies will accept, we're clearly going to have discussions with them. But the endpoint that we reported is a registrational endpoint. And we hope to have further discussions with the FDA. Clearly, we are advancing the study to do the other endpoints that you outlined in terms of overall survival as well. So let me take that question. Thank you very much for that question. We're very confident in our molnupiravir program. As you outlined, we are advancing the outpatient. And I should also say that we are poised to start the Phase III portion of that outpatient study imminently. As you know, this is a global trial with a recruitment strategy focused in areas where we are looking at vaccination rates that are unfortunately low. So we are in Africa, we are in South America. Those will be very important sites. We anticipate that there will be more than 100 sites to contribute. This is a global study.  In terms of your question in relationship with India, we are -- we have entered into a voluntary license agreement with 5 Indian generic manufacturers to expand global access to molnupiravir. At this time, we are not extending our clinical trial for MOVe-OUT into India. And then finally, what I would say is our clinical safety and virologic data gives us great confidence to evaluate molnupiravir, not just in the MOVe-OUT study, but also for postexposure prophylaxis in a study starting later this year. Yes. That's a great question. This is Dean. I'll try to give a scientific point of view and then I'll now send it to Frank to give a more commercial sort of point of view.  In relationship to molnupiravir, we think we are imminently going to do the Phase III trial in the outpatient setting, as was noted in the previous question. We're tightening up the inclusion criteria, reducing the allowable symptom duration for enrollment to be less than 5 days, and we're trying to enroll patients early in the course of disease who have a high risk for poor outcomes. That includes age and other risk factors such as obesity and diabetes. So we think that will be critically important to have a successful and timely trial.  In relationship to the postexposure prophylaxis, there's a number of ways one can design that trial. But if I can just take it as a higher elevation, we think that this MOVe-OUT and the prophylaxis studies is going to be very important, not just for Merck but for the world. As one sees the different places of vaccination, some of it albeit extremely low, it's creating a reservoir for variants -- the ability to have a small molecule that can easily be delivered orally is going to be really important for the world. So that's what we've been focused on.  But let me turn it to Frank to focus on the framework that you've asked in terms of the commercial impact. Thank you for that excellent question. This is Dean. Let me give a little bit of framework for the mRNA. I would reemphasize that Merck has been very interested in mRNA and other nucleic acid technology and specifically in the vaccine in mRNA. For the past 5 to 6 years, Merck has partnered with Moderna on vaccines for infectious disease and vaccines for cancer. The validation of the mRNA technology in COVID is impressive and at least, personally, is deserving of admiration and thanks. We continue to be interested in mRNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies, including viral-based platforms, for vaccines.  I would highlight, and specific to your question about GARDASIL, when you have multiple sort of antigens that you have to deliver, I think there is a role for those sort of platforms, protein-based. I think there's going to be many different platforms that need to be done specifically for the vaccine and the threat that you're trying to prevent. So RNA and other nucleic-acid-based technologies is important to us, including viral-based platforms. But we also think that broader speaking, there are other protein subunit, other vaccine platforms that will still be relevant moving forward. Yes. Thank you for that question. Let me just take a high level and then answer the temporal question that was asked. The sort of opportunities that we look for, both in our internal pipeline and external pipeline, we like -- or I like assets that give me concentration leverage, foundational drugs where clear monotherapy efficacy gives me a fulcrum for combination. And specifically in relationship to cancer, that allows us to expand, deepen and extend. And as we look for these foundational medicines and the recent discussions with Gilead and Pandion, it just shows that, that sort of attitude of how we want to sort of proceed where we're taking foundational medicines and we're matching them with internal and external pipeline so that we can diversify the pipeline.  And specific to your question, I would look at the '21 to '24 range. There's a whole slew of Lynparza, Lenvima, KEYTRUDA study that you will see, a lot of it driving to adjuvant at earlier stages. I think there's at least 20 registrational trials. I sort of laid out maybe 4 or so that you'll see in the next year. In relationship to the business development, what you will see is in the '24, '25 time frame, things like the islatravir, Tilos, Seagen, that was also CTLA-4, LAG-3 TIGIT, all of them will be in striking range to not just see sort of Phase II studies but potentially interim analysis or even complete analysis of those assets in that time frame. So you'll see these different ways going through."

The presentation, today\u2019s earnings release, as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2022 was an exceptional year for Merck. Our science-led strategy is working and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what our team has delivered scientifically, commercially and operationally. We are focusing on what matters and keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We made significant progress in 2022 advancing our broad pipeline, with important internal success complemented by a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. We have moved with speed and urgency to drive strong progress and we have provided increased transparency into several of our long-term opportunities, including for GARDASIL, for our cardiovascular pipeline, and more recently, from newer assets that leverage our leadership position in Oncology. We enter 2023 with even greater confidence that we are creating a sustainable engine that will bring forth innovation and generate value for both patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning first to our results. The business is performing extremely well. The growth we have experienced in 2022 reflects a sustained track record of fundamental strength from our de-risked key growth pillars. We begin the year with confidence that we will maintain this strong underlying growth, after taking into account the significant impact LAGEVRIO had during the height of the pandemic last year and are pleased to reflect this in our 2023 initial guidance. Importantly, our pipeline is advancing with significant progress across several late-stage programs. In Oncology, we have expansive research efforts, including our ambition to move treatment into earlier stage settings where there is higher potential for more favorable longer term outcomes for patients. In December, along with our partner Moderna, we were pleased to announce highly encouraging Phase 2 results for a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. We are excited by the potential that this combination may have for patients across a range of tumor types. And last week, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy, which Caroline and Dean will speak to. In Cardiovascular, we are exploring candidates across a broad range of diseases and have made substantial progress from just one year ago. At the American College of Cardiology conference, we will present data from the STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and from the Phase 2 trial of MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor and we will also host an investor event to discuss these programs. In Vaccines, Instituto Butantan in Brazil, with whom we are collaborating for vaccine development, reported very encouraging topline results for their candidate for the prevention of dengue. These data will inform future development of our dengue vaccine, V181, and our efforts to address this critical public health challenge. Finally, through our business development efforts, we brought in four programs which will have phase three trial starts in 2023 and which have the opportunity to contribute meaningful growth during the latter half of this decade and into the next. We are following our disciplined approach to business development and we will act when scientific opportunity and value align. We have more to do, but I feel very good about the progress we made in 2022 and we believe that all of these efforts will lead to real benefits for patients and in turn for shareholders. We enter 2023 with confidence in the innovation engine we are building and our ability to deliver sustainable value for patients well into the next decade. We will continue to execute on our de-risked assets and act with urgency to advance and grow our pipeline. We are doing all of this with an approach to sustainability that is closely aligned to our overall business strategy. I am very confident in the short- and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to providing future updates.  With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, 2022 was an exceptional year for our company. We delivered excellent topline growth of 22% driven by strength across our key pillars of Oncology, Vaccines and Hospital, as well as a significant contribution from LAGEVRIO. Our Animal Health business delivered strong operational growth, which was offset by foreign exchange. These results are a testament to the profound impact our medicines and vaccines are having on patients globally, which are enabled by our dedicated teams who are executing with excellence to deliver these important innovations. We are confident in the health of our business and in our outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange, the business delivered strong operational growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses continued their strong growth increasing 9% and 6%, respectively. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.5 billion, driven by strong global demand for in-line indications, as well as continued global expansion from new approvals. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA continues to have a profound impact on patients, including in earlier-stage cancers, where there is greater potential for better outcomes. We are excited by the recent approval of KEYNOTE-091, which represents KEYTRUDA\u2019s seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with others to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other tumor types, such as breast, where screening programs are more routine. While we are committed to addressing this unmet need, we anticipate a more gradual near-term uptake from this indication. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintains its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, which gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to positively impact patients in the earlier setting. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in metastatic indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as recent launches in earlier-stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza maintains its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Alliance revenue grew 14% primarily due to continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 9%, driven by increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the U.S. Lastly, WELIREG is performing in-line with our expectations and we are proud of the impact it is having on adult patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered growth, with GARDASIL increasing 6% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. In the U.S., sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccines sales also benefited from the pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which is off to an encouraging start, with revenues also benefitting from inventory stocking. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 7%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Hospital Acute Care sales also benefitted from the resupply of ZERBAXA, which started in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6% reflecting strategic price actions and volume growth. Livestock sales grew 12% driven by increased demand in ruminants and poultry products. Companion animal sales were negatively impacted by supply challenges for certain vaccines and a reduction in vet visits in October, which improved during the quarter. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.7 billion, reflecting increased investments to support our portfolio and growing pipeline. Other income was $86 million, reflecting the return on pension plan assets and capitalized interest, which was largely offset by net interest expense. Our tax rate was 15.6%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.62.  Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The strength across our key pillars is expected to continue into this year. We project revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. Excluding the negative impact of LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates, we expect strong underlying revenue growth of 7% to 10%. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.  Operating expenses are assumed to be between $23.1 billion and $24.1 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of research and development expenses related to our acquisition of Imago and the expansion of our collaboration with Kelun Biotech. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $6.80 to $6.95. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% using mid-January rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the continued strong growth across Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. On revenues, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. Global immunization levels remain low, which creates a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients and we are improving supply, which positions us well to support the significant demand we are experiencing today and expect over the long-term for this vaccine that prevents HPV-related cancers. Other Revenue is projected to decline significantly, primarily reflecting a smaller planned benefit from revenue hedges following the U.S. dollar strength last year, which resulted in an approximate $800 million benefit in 2022. Other revenue is also expected to be lower due to the discontinuation of third-party manufacturing sales to Johnson and Johnson. On the rest of the P&L, we project a shift from other expense to other income, which is primarily attributable to an assumption that there will be no pension settlement cost, as well as an expectation of lower net interest expense and higher joint venture equity income. This benefit is more than offset by an increase in the estimated tax rate due to the unfavorable impact of the R&D capitalization provision, as well as an approximate 1 percentage point impact related to Imago. Now shifting to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited about the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our pipeline in 2022. In 2023, we will continue to invest in opportunities that will address important unmet medical needs and drive the next wave of growth for our company, including the initiation of many late-stage clinical trials across a broad set of novel candidates. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. We will continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-enhancing business development to augment our internal pipeline and will invest appropriately to maximize the potential of our R&D programs. Given the strength of our business and balance sheet, we plan to resume share repurchases, while ensuring we maintain ample capacity to pursue additional business development, which is the higher priority. To conclude, we enter 2023 confident in our ability to execute on the important opportunities we have to deliver innovation to patients and sustain the strong underlying growth of our business well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Today, I will provide notable updates since our last earnings call. We continue to make significant advancements and achieve important regulatory milestones. The fourth quarter marks the end of a successful year with progress made across Oncology, Vaccines, Infectious Diseases and Cardiology. Let me start with Oncology. We remain committed to transforming the landscape of cancer therapy with an ongoing focus on treating earlier stages of disease. We are pleased by the recent approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with Stage Ib, II or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of KEYNOTE-091. This approval provides for the very first time an adjuvant immunotherapy option for this patient population with Stage Ib disease and regardless of PD-L1 status. Beyond KEYNOTE-091, we have additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer including, KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant therapy in resectable Stage II, IIIa and IIIb disease, KEYNOTE-867 evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy with unresected Stage I or II disease, and KEYLYNK-012 studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage III disease. These trials are all part of our broader effort to treat earlier stages of cancers and further improve patient outcomes across tumor types, such as melanoma. Together with Moderna, we announced positive Phase 2 results for V940/mRNA-4157, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone. This investigational personalized neoantigen therapy utilizes mRNA technology and is specifically tailored to target the unique mutational signature of each patient\u2019s tumor. We plan to discuss the results with regulators and initiate Phase 3 trials in multiple tumors this year. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. We also announced positive results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-966 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer. In addition, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In November, we announced the acquisition of Imago Biosciences, which closed last month. Imago\u2019s lead candidate, bomedemstat, is a potentially first-in-class orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The combined team is now focused on continuing to advance the ongoing clinical development programs. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, data were presented from multiple pipeline candidates including, favezelimab, our anti-LAG3 antibody, zilovertamab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, targeting ROR-1, nemtabrutinib, our oral reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor, as well as KEYTRUDA. Updated Phase 2 data for bomedemstat in essential thrombocythemia and advanced myelofibrosis were also presented. We continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. In the European Union, along with our partner, Astra Zeneca, we announced the approval for Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROpel trial. In China, based on the results of KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE-394, we received approvals for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant / adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. With our partners, Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA has accepted supplemental biologics license applications for KEYTRUDA with PADCEV, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The agency set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023 for each application. Building on the clinical benefits observed with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, we have focused on augmenting our tissue targeting candidates through business development. We announced the expansion of our agreement with Kelun Biotech with the addition of up to seven preclinical antibody drug conjugates. The collaboration leverages technology with the potential to yield a new generation of candidates designed to precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumor site. This follows previously disclosed agreements for two clinical stage candidates, including MK-2870, an investigational TROP2 targeting ADC we are planning to advance into Phase 3 trials this year. We also expanded our collaboration with PeptiDream to include the discovery and development of peptide drug conjugates. This technology potentially provides for improved permeability and drug selectivity in targeting tumor tissue. Next to our Vaccines portfolio. We were encouraged by the progress scientists and clinicians at the Instituto Butantan in Brazil made in developing a single dose dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Brazil. We are collaborating with the team there to conduct a detailed analysis of these positive, topline Phase 3 results to determine next steps for our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, currently in Phase 2 development. Merck\u2019s goal is to make V181 available outside of Brazil for populations at-risk for dengue. As Caroline noted, we are receiving positive feedback from the field regarding the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and remain confident in our population specific strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. VAXNEUVANCE offers strong protection, including in the first year of life, with robust immunity across all shared and unique serotypes. This is important because the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is greatest in the first year of life for children. Also, we are on track and look forward to the Phase 3 results from our V116 program for the protection of adults this year. We, along with others in the industry, are making a real impact in our goal to help reduce cancer incidence. It was noteworthy that the American Cancer Society\u2019s recently published annual report on cancer facts and trends included the remarkable observation that there has been a 65% reduction in cervical cancer incidence in women 20 years old to 24 years old from 2012 through 2019. It is this type of finding that further reinforces Merck\u2019s commitment to bringing forward treatment and prevention options to help patients with this devastating disease. As part of this commitment, we are encouraged by the role GARDASIL continues to play in helping to prevent certain HPV related cervical cancers.  Turning to the broader portfolio. With the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce the incidence of disease and burden on healthcare systems. We were pleased LAGEVRIO was granted conditional marketing authorization by China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration in December, for use in adult patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and a high risk of progressing to severe cases. I wish to reinforce something Rob mentioned. Please mark your calendars for March 6th where we will present detailed findings of the Phase 3 STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Phase 2 results for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans. We will also host a live investor event to answer your questions. We look forward to bringing sotatercept as an important treatment option to patients and are currently working towards submission of the data from the STELLAR trial. We are in discussions with the FDA about submission of the data on a rolling basis, which is likely to result in a potential approval in early 2024. As we close out 2022, it is important to highlight that over the course of the year we made strong progress across therapeutic areas, modalities, stages of development and multiple business development transactions. In Oncology, we obtained several important regulatory approvals globally for KEYTRUDA and Lynparza, as well as advanced a number of programs evaluating earlier stage cancer regimens. In Vaccines, we received an important approval in pediatrics for VAXNEUVANCE. In addition, we were granted expanded authorizations in China and active recommendations were reinstated in Japan for GARDASIL. In HIV, we resumed our clinical development program for islatravir. And finally in cardiovascular disease, we made significant progress across our pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia programs.  Taken together, we continue to deliver on our strategy of advancing promising candidates across multiple therapeutic areas. We have strong momentum across our pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our progress in 2023. And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Dean. Kelly, we are ready to take questions now. We intend to end the call at 9 sharp this morning, so request that analysts limit themselves to one question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just you made some comments around sort of uptake in the adjuvant setting after the most recent label update. Can you maybe just sort of set expectations there and does that comment reflect any sort of assumptions around when we might see mature data from the PEARLS study potentially this year? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So I believe you are speaking about KEYNOTE-091. So I just want to take a broad view and then today view and the tomorrow view. So I would just count that the American Cancer Society in 2023, it\u2019s really remarkable. They suggest that for between 1991 and 2023, there\u2019s a massive reduction in lung cancer of 58%, 36% and KEYTRUDA has been critical in that story and now we are moving to early lung. The label is broad. It is regardless of PD-L1 and it reflects the clinical trial, where we demonstrated a 27% reduction. We are pushing into these earlier lines with other trials. But I think for what we need to set for is two things. We need to make it much more easier with scientific innovation other means to get subcu, I mean, to get KEYTRUDA and that\u2019s why we are very eager to push our subcu pembrolizumab with [inaudible] to face through this year. But we also need to do a lot to improve adherence to established guidelines, which currently only have 6% or so of individuals actually who should be screened in the United States. So, I think, with that, we have work to do in relationship to really taking this important advance and making it broadly available through to individuals who should be getting screened.\nRob Davis: So, Carter, maybe I can just add on a little bit about the commercial opportunity. As Dean said, this will be a slower ramp, because we have to drive more people to get diagnosed early so that we can get them the care they need. But just to give you some sizing of this. If you look at 2023, there are about 230,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer in U.S. and the majority of that group was not diagnosed until they were in the metastatic setting. So if you think about it from a minority perspective, we would estimate about 120,000 people in the early-stage setting, of which only a quarter will have a section or have surgery and be in the Stage Ib to IIIa, which is what our label indicates. So you are looking at about 30,000 patients who would be the addressable population and then obviously, of that group, historically, only about half of those patients have gone on to receive treatment in the form of chemotherapy or IO. So that\u2019s obviously something we hope to change as we go forward, because we think the outcome will show that if you are resected, you should pursue KEYTRUDA in that setting and it\u2019s our goal over time not only to drive more patients in that segment. But, obviously, the more people we can get diagnosed early pre-metastatic, then actually we will expand the population over time. So we see this as a meaningful opportunity long-term that is going to take us time to ramp as we work to change the paradigm that\u2019s existed in the past. Thank you, Carter. Next question, please, Kelly?\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Hi. Thank you. A couple of questions, could you please address the demand on Merck\u2019s business to the hole associated with the KEYTRUDA LOE post-2028 or alternatively instead just build the exit growth rate and focus less on finding revenues to plug the hole as you think about your strategy? And perhaps quickly for, Dean, could you just give us some guidance on the timing for the PFS analysis and the PD-L1 high, greater than 50 cohort from KEYVIBE-003. Should we expect it in the next 12 months? I know the total PFS reset for the whole trial is somewhere in 2024, but it strikes me you may have a mere separate analysis for that greater than 50 subgroup? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Great. Well, maybe, Andrew, I will start off and if Caroline or Dean want to jump in. But to give you a sense, obviously, we haven\u2019t given specific guidance to the LOE period. But just to ground everyone into facts, KEYTRUDA and our expectation will lose exclusivity in the United States in 2028 and in China in 2028. It leaves it in Europe in 2030 and in Japan in 2032. So, obviously, by shorthand, we refer to 2028, but the reality of it is over most of the markets and KEYTRUDA increasingly is becoming, as you know, a global product, it\u2019s spread out. But as we look at where we sit today, I would say, we feel good about the progress we have made. We are confident that we are on a path to sustainable growth into the next decade. Obviously, we have more work to do, but I would just point to you to a few proof points that I think support that. First of all, as we talked about in the last 18 months, we have made meaningful progress in our cardiovascular pipeline. We have eight potential approvals between 2025 and 2030. Obviously, the centerpiece of that is sotatercept and what we are seeing from the STELLAR data, which really was just quite phenomenal. If you look at that, we expect those products, that portfolio of opportunity on an unrisk adjusted basis to be in excess of $10 billion as you approach the mid-2030s. We recently discussed the fact we see the business development deals we have done. We have brought in new assets apart from KEYTRUDA, apart from Lynparza, Lenvima and WELIREG, that themselves, these new mechanisms, I would point you to things like Orion and Imago, those products, along with what we see in the ADC space as a portfolio, we think themselves have the potential for $10 billion or more of revenue as you get into the early to mid-2030s. So today we sit there with the expectation that we are starting to make meaningful progress and that excludes all the work we are doing to bring an incremental value to patients on KEYTRUDA. Obviously, as great as KEYTRUDA is, it still only has an overall response rate averaging around 30%. We need to deepen and drive better response. We are looking to do that through combinations and through other means to find ways to improve on KEYTRUDA. We are looking to continue to expand into new tumor types as well and clearly move into earlier lines of therapy where we believe we can start to move to a point that we can actually give people an extension of life, and hopefully, someday get to a point that we talk about cancer a chronic disease, not a fatal disease. Obviously, we have more to do there, but that is the aspiration and we have a lot of efforts underway to do that through what we are doing in IO combinations, IO/ADC combinations with our subcutaneous offering. And then, obviously, we are very excited recently about the deal we did with Moderna for the personalized cancer vaccine, which is really a therapeutic that we think, in combination with KEYTRUDA, while we are studying in first in melanoma, obviously, we believe, has the potential to move into broader tumor. So that in and of itself gives us a lot of confidence and we are doing similar activities with Lynparza, with Lenvima, and obviously, WELIREG it\u2019s in early days. So if you look at the total of that and I have even gotten into our Vaccines portfolio and what we see as excitement there, we feel like we have made a lot of progress. We have more to do, but that\u2019s why you hear me talk more about how do we build the sustainable engine to drive growth well into the next decade and that really should be a focus point, because I am confident, if we do that well, the LOE of KEYTRUDA will take curve itself. So Dean?\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So there was a question on our TIGIT program, KEYTRUDA plus TIGIT. Just to remind everyone, we have nine ongoing trials. We have five Phase 3s. In fact, just recently, we opened up KEYVIBE-10, which is Phase 3 in early melanoma. In relationship to KEYVIBE-003, which I think is the question, we added the TPS greater than 50% as an endpoint. These are event driven, and as the events drive to statistically and clinically meaningful data, we will announce it appropriately.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman from BMO. Evan, your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. I would love for you to talk to what might make MK-2870 better TROP2 targeting ADC versus those that we have seen from Gilead and Astra and Daiichi. Also, do you still believe that it\u2019s too difficult to combine an ADC plus IO in a fixed dose combination? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So let me just state, I -- we will be starting a whole series of Phase 3 trials this year. I really appreciate your question. For me, the critical thing is, whether it be an ADC or whether it be a RAS inhibitor in solid tumors, especially as you want to advance them in solid tumors where IO has been important, the combination benefit of the two becomes really important. So we are very excited to be pushing forward our TROP2 ADC. I can get into the details of the molecules and the linkers and the payloads and the darts. But really, the better sort of thing is, I believe that this year, we will be presenting our Phase 2 studies, and at the end of the day, that will be the most convincing data to provide to you as to why we think we have been important play with our TROP2 ADC, but it\u2019s also the play of that TROP2 ADC in relationship to adding it to an IO agent. We think that is an important considerations when thinking about any cancer killing mechanism in solid tumors.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Evan. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to know how you are thinking about your Phase 3 trial design for your oral PCSK9 and how will that design really highlight the competitive advantages of your product? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you very much. So, first, I don\u2019t want to get ahead too much of our March 6 Investor meeting where we are least showing the data that we have in relationship to the oral PCSK9 and sotatercept. I will just sort of emphasize what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish is we are trying to accomplish the most potent LDL lowering oral pill for lowering cholesterol. There should be no co-chain, there should be very little need to interact with the healthcare system, which makes it reach very easy and very accessible, not just in the U.S. but globally. And we need to do it at a price point of what I would call a branded oral medicine would be not in order to maximize the access. In relationship with Phase 3, there\u2019s a general set sort of view of how that is. One is you would drive it, because LDL lowering is such a clean biomarker. So that\u2019s something. But one would also have that, at the same time, drive towards outcomes, which is also going to be important. So our Phase 3 trial design is informed by the history of the field has been and what the FDA\u2019s regulatory sort of outline have been for others.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is open.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. If I could ask you a question on V940 cancer vaccine, what tumor types outside of melanoma, do you already have any positive human data and even if those are earlier stage? And if you don\u2019t have any human data in nonmelanoma tumor types, can you talk about animal data? I am trying to obviously think about what Phase 3 trials you may be starting in 2023 with that product? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you very much. So you are speaking about the wonderful partnership that we have with Moderna in the personalized cancer vaccine. I just want to preface everything. What we have released is topline data in melanoma. That data will be presented sometime in the near-term where we present the data that we have for melanoma and we have work to do to move that into Phase 3. So I -- we have a lot of work to do just in melanoma. I am not going to speak ahead of a human data we have outside of that. But I would say two things that are really important. One is one can watch which of the tumors have sensitivity to an immune approach and one can watch about the clinical development with KEYTRUDA to sort of map out where you would think about doing that. The second issue that I would emphasize is that, when we are talking about an IO-IO strategy, which often people speak about, I view this personalized neoantigen therapy as an IO-IO strategy with KEYTRUDA. And the reason I want to emphasize that is, there is a view that we are beginning to develop that IO-IO strategies may be especially useful in early cancer stages and you see that in our interest in our combination projects related to checkpoint inhibitors, but also in relationship to personalized neoantigen therapy. And so we think that, that\u2019s around that we are going to advance and the critical component for us to be able to advance that is to advance KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy in indications, because it creates us to actually do these clinical trials.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes -- Geoff from Bank of America. Geoff, your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Dean, on subcu feature, can you talk about the cadence of data this year and what you are ultimately looking for from a risk/benefit perspective, as you evaluate different technologies? And Rob, I wasn\u2019t sure where this program ranks on kind of your strategic priorities across IO? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: So thank you very much for that question. I think it\u2019s on -- we will be -- when we talk about starting 10 to 15 Phase 3 clinical trials, just in Oncology, this subcu program is a critical component to that and we will be starting those Phase 3 this year. What are we seeking to achieve? I have talked about the early cancer space. Early cancer space, I think, is really important just from a medical standpoint of where we can intact really the outcomes of patients. We can markedly improve that. If you are going to go in the early space, whether it\u2019s neoadjuvant or adjuvant, from my clinical training, working with lung cancer doctors and oncologists, our ability to limit the need for individuals to constantly come to infusion centers is very important and we need to have the scientific innovation to do that. In doing that, we have to think carefully about how do we give as much optionality to three weeks to six weeks in that subcu regimen and that\u2019s what we are trying to drive through in our Phase 3 trials. Rob, did you want to answer anything else?\nRob Davis: No. I appreciate the question, Geoff. I think Dean covered it well. This is a very important part of our overall strategy as we think about moving into earlier lines of therapy and then to drive convenience and access for patients, which is very important. So it\u2019s meaningful and it\u2019s something we are going to pursue as fast as we can. Thanks, Geoff. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. I think I have a big picture question regarding IO-IO combinations and the development strategies there, because the common criticism is that, many of these big Phase 3 studies were started with after less than robust Phase 2 data and that\u2019s why they failed to show benefit in Phase 3. I mean looking at your data in Phase 2, they are single-arm data as well. So can you just help us understand what gives you confidence that this is the right strategy to move forward and wouldn\u2019t it be better to do some kind of Phase 2 trial where you are -- you have pembro as a control? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. Thank you very much. I will just emphasize that as a general rule the way that I have begun to develop my view of IO-IO strategies, is that IO-IO strategies are very important to pursue. I think that IO-IO strategies plus other therapies that kill cancers may be especially important in the metastatic, but IO-IO strategies in the early stage could be quite impactful. And so, as I have just said, we have advanced our IO-IO strategy. We have advanced it with TIGIT CTLA-4 and LAG-3, so another component part. But I would just say this, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s one single addition to KEYTRUDA that will have the breadth of KEYTRUDA. So we have been a little bit selective there and I think the movement of IO-IO, not just in the metastatic space, but especially in the early space will become important. And the ability to do that requires your first IO of that IO-IO to be approved in the early space and that is why we are so excited about moving into earlier spaces with KEYTRUDA, because that allows us to execute in an IO-IO strategy in early-stage cancers.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Mohit. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much. I think you mentioned that you are looking to review share repo and it does seem like maybe, Rob, some of your recent business development commentary has been skewed towards smaller deals or collaboration. So can you just put into context what you view as an appropriate level of leverage for Merck and should we be thinking about kind of the cash generation beyond that level as maybe going towards repo going forward? And I just have really quick second one, just help me on FX. I think you are talking about a 2% headwind, most of your peers aren\u2019t seeing much given the recent weakening of the dollar. Are there any currencies that stand out we should be keeping in mind there? Thanks so much.\nCaroline Litchfield: Yeah. Chris, this is Caroline. First to talk to share repurchase, as we have stated previously, it\u2019s our goal as a company to deploy our cash, first and foremost, behind the business opportunities we have within the company, as well as augment that with business development. We have turned on the share repurchase program, given the strength of our business and our balance sheet, but we will be ensuring we have ample capacity to pursue business development, which is the highest priority and is a better generator of growth and value creation. We have a portfolio of BD that we are reviewing and we will continue to do some test have news that we will be sharing in future. So priority remains really investing in the business, but to the extent, there is excess cash, we will return that to shareholders through the share buyback. We will maintain an appropriate leverage for our company. We are very comfortable operating at the credit rating we are at and we would expect to sustain that kind of level as we go forward. From a foreign exchange perspective, in 2022, we were extremely successful as a company in blunting the impact of foreign exchange with our revenue hedging program. The underlying impact of foreign exchange to our business in 2022 was approximately 6% on the topline, 10% on the bottomline, but with our expected hedging program, which brought revenue on the other revenue line of approximately $800 million that blunted the impact to 4% on the top and 4% on the bottom. As you rightly note, as we look at 2023, we expect the underlying impact of foreign exchange to be around 1 percentage point on the top and the bottomline. What is impacting the guidance that we have given is we obviously don\u2019t expect as significant hedge gains in 2023, which means that the overall impact from foreign exchange year-over-year is expected to be 2% on the top and 4% on the bottom.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I know you guys typically don\u2019t give product level guidance, Caroline. But I was wondering if you can speak at a high level about your Vaccine franchise this year. Obviously, you have new capacity coming on for GARDASIL, but you also talked about the pediatric opportunity for VAXNEUVANCE. So just wondering how we should think about those this year. And then one follow-up for Dean on sotatercept, I know you are talking to the FDA now. Are you still confident that, that single trial will be sufficient for approval or is there a possibility you could need data from the other ongoing studies? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question. So the guidance that we provided for 2023 is underpinned by very strong revenue growth of 7% to 10% when you exclude the impact of LAGEVRIO as foreign exchange. The drivers of that growth are our key pillars of Oncology, where we expect continued impact to patients and growth driven the portfolio of indications we have in KEYTRUDA, Lynparza and Lenvima. Vaccines, as you rightly note, driven by an acceleration expected in the growth of GARDASIL as we have new supply coming on line, as well as an acceleration in our VAXNEUVANCE performance, especially given the strong data we have for the pediatric setting. And we expect continued growth strong growth in our Animal Health business. There are some headwinds against that that we have talked about with LAGEVRIO with foreign exchange and with an increased level of pricing expected, especially in Europe with the changes we have seen in U.K. and also in Germany. But, overall, very confident in the underlying growth of our business anchored to Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. Dean?\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So, again, March 6th, clinical trial data for sotatercept will be more fully discussed. I think it will be very impactful data and I have no indication at this point that we will need a readout from any other trial from a clinical standpoint to support our filing to the FDA for 10%.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS. Colin, your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I guess I will piggyback on a couple of the others. On TIGIT, we have obviously seen some competitive data recently and then we have some Phase 3 competitor readout this year. Just what is your level of enthusiasm for this class currently and just what underpins that in terms of the data we have seen? And then just second on GARDASIL, are you able to give any more granularity on the timing and levels of additional supply that will be coming online with respect to the new manufacturing facility? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. Well, thank you for that question. In relationship to TIGIT, I mean, we are very confident on our molecule. As I have said, we have nine ongoing five Phase 3 trials. Pushing the boundaries of what pembro can do or PD-1 can do with another IO agent has been something that\u2019s very important for the field. And the way that I can simply answer your question about the confidence the molecule is, we just opened an additional KEYVIBE study, a Phase 3 study in the earlier stages of cancer for this IO-IO combination.\nCaroline Litchfield: And for GARDASIL, we -- as you know, we have driven productivity in the existing manufacturing facilities we have and we have two new facilities coming online over the course of 2023, 2024. So it will be a progressive ramp, but I will reiterate we are expecting an acceleration in our growth during 2023.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. There was a story in New York Times last week, which mentioned Merck has a patent state of 180 patents on KEYTRUDA, and I am curious, since your 10-K only points to the earliest patent expiry date of 2028. Can you speak to the types of patents encompassed in this 180 patent estate and is it reasonable to assume that your true patent estate on KEYTRUDA goes well past 2035? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So I would just want to elevate the question a little bit. The focus of what we are trying to do is we are trying to drive the concept of inhibition of checkpoint inhibitors can really have a profound effect throughout cancers in all stages in all tumor types. We talk about expand into different tissue types and stages, deepen in combination and extend with routes of delivery, roots of indentation and frequent safety and these innovations are critically important to make sure that this life saving sort of treatment is available. And we are confident in those innovations providing benefit to patients and we have filed where appropriate intellectual property for it -- for that.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Umer. Last question please, Kelly.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve, your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. Novartis said yesterday that it believes the treatment of cardiovascular disease is moving towards infrequently administered injectables as opposed to orals citing very poor compliance with orals. They probably have a good point because the Merck PCSK9 could be associated with GI issues and other issues, which may make oral delivery a challenge. So I assume you disagree is that because indeed, your oral PCSK9 is very well tolerated and clean or do you disagree for other reasons? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: We will be talking about the detailed data from the PCSK9. We believe that it\u2019s very clean. But I will just step back as a cardiologist who trained in the late 1980s and 1990s, the ability to have an oral drug that lowered LDL cholesterol was impactful for the world. Yes, every oral drug, regardless of what therapy it is, has a compliance, so it\u2019s very important to maintain clients. What we are trying to do is to create the most potent LDL cholesterol lowering pill ever made that does not require constant interactions with a healthcare system, we think that, that axis is actually one that\u2019s very important, not just in the U.S., but also globally. And this is personally speaking, as someone who practices early, as of late, as recently as five years ago. If I had an oral PCSK9 LDL lowering pill back then, I would be prescribing it with the other three to four oral pills that I am prescribing an individual.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Steve, and thank you everybody for your thoughtful questions. Please follow-up with me and the IR team if you have anything additional and we look forward to staying in touch. Take care.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, 2022 was an exceptional year for our company. We delivered excellent topline growth of 22% driven by strength across our key pillars of Oncology, Vaccines and Hospital, as well as a significant contribution from LAGEVRIO. Our Animal Health business delivered strong operational growth, which was offset by foreign exchange. These results are a testament to the profound impact our medicines and vaccines are having on patients globally, which are enabled by our dedicated teams who are executing with excellence to deliver these important innovations. We are confident in the health of our business and in our outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $13.8 billion, an increase of 2%. Excluding the impact from foreign exchange, the business delivered strong operational growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health and Animal Health businesses continued their strong growth increasing 9% and 6%, respectively. Now, turning to the fourth quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.5 billion, driven by strong global demand for in-line indications, as well as continued global expansion from new approvals. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier-stage cancers, including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA continues to have a profound impact on patients, including in earlier-stage cancers, where there is greater potential for better outcomes. We are excited by the recent approval of KEYNOTE-091, which represents KEYTRUDA's seventh indication in earlier-stage cancers. Early lung cancer detection and screening remain an important unmet need. It is our ambition, along with others to improve lung cancer screening rates to levels similar to other tumor types, such as breast, where screening programs are more routine. While we are committed to addressing this unmet need, we anticipate a more gradual near-term uptake from this indication. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintains its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, which gives us confidence that we are well-positioned to positively impact patients in the earlier setting. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in metastatic indications, including non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as recent launches in earlier-stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza maintains its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Alliance revenue grew 14% primarily due to continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 9%, driven by increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and advanced endometrial cancer in the U.S. Lastly, WELIREG is performing in-line with our expectations and we are proud of the impact it is having on adult patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered growth, with GARDASIL increasing 6% to $1.5 billion, driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. In the U.S., sales decreased primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccines sales also benefited from the pediatric launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which is off to an encouraging start, with revenues also benefitting from inventory stocking. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 7%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. Hospital Acute Care sales also benefitted from the resupply of ZERBAXA, which started in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6% reflecting strategic price actions and volume growth. Livestock sales grew 12% driven by increased demand in ruminants and poultry products. Companion animal sales were negatively impacted by supply challenges for certain vaccines and a reduction in vet visits in October, which improved during the quarter. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 75.7%, an increase of 0.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses increased 8% to $5.7 billion, reflecting increased investments to support our portfolio and growing pipeline. Other income was $86 million, reflecting the return on pension plan assets and capitalized interest, which was largely offset by net interest expense. Our tax rate was 15.6%. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.62.  Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The strength across our key pillars is expected to continue into this year. We project revenue to be between $57.2 billion and $58.7 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. Excluding the negative impact of LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2% negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-January rates, we expect strong underlying revenue growth of 7% to 10%. Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 77%.  Operating expenses are assumed to be between $23.1 billion and $24.1 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of research and development expenses related to our acquisition of Imago and the expansion of our collaboration with Kelun Biotech. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $6.80 to $6.95. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4% using mid-January rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the continued strong growth across Oncology, Vaccines and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. On revenues, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. Global immunization levels remain low, which creates a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients and we are improving supply, which positions us well to support the significant demand we are experiencing today and expect over the long-term for this vaccine that prevents HPV-related cancers. Other Revenue is projected to decline significantly, primarily reflecting a smaller planned benefit from revenue hedges following the U.S. dollar strength last year, which resulted in an approximate $800 million benefit in 2022. Other revenue is also expected to be lower due to the discontinuation of third-party manufacturing sales to Johnson and Johnson. On the rest of the P&L, we project a shift from other expense to other income, which is primarily attributable to an assumption that there will be no pension settlement cost, as well as an expectation of lower net interest expense and higher joint venture equity income. This benefit is more than offset by an increase in the estimated tax rate due to the unfavorable impact of the R&D capitalization provision, as well as an approximate 1 percentage point impact related to Imago. Now shifting to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are excited about the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our pipeline in 2022. In 2023, we will continue to invest in opportunities that will address important unmet medical needs and drive the next wave of growth for our company, including the initiation of many late-stage clinical trials across a broad set of novel candidates. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. We will continue to pursue the most compelling external science through value-enhancing business development to augment our internal pipeline and will invest appropriately to maximize the potential of our R&D programs. Given the strength of our business and balance sheet, we plan to resume share repurchases, while ensuring we maintain ample capacity to pursue additional business development, which is the higher priority. To conclude, we enter 2023 confident in our ability to execute on the important opportunities we have to deliver innovation to patients and sustain the strong underlying growth of our business well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Yeah. Chris, this is Caroline. First to talk to share repurchase, as we have stated previously, it's our goal as a company to deploy our cash, first and foremost, behind the business opportunities we have within the company, as well as augment that with business development. We have turned on the share repurchase program, given the strength of our business and our balance sheet, but we will be ensuring we have ample capacity to pursue business development, which is the highest priority and is a better generator of growth and value creation.

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. 2022 was an exceptional year for Merck. Our science-led strategy is working and I couldn't be more proud of what our team has delivered scientifically, commercially and operationally. We are focusing on what matters and keeping the patient at the center of everything we do. We made significant progress in 2022 advancing our broad pipeline, with important internal success complemented by a portfolio of strategic acquisitions, collaborations and partnerships. We have moved with speed and urgency to drive strong progress and we have provided increased transparency into several of our long-term opportunities, including for GARDASIL, for our cardiovascular pipeline, and more recently, from newer assets that leverage our leadership position in Oncology. We enter 2023 with even greater confidence that we are creating a sustainable engine that will bring forth innovation and generate value for both patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning first to our results. The business is performing extremely well. The growth we have experienced in 2022 reflects a sustained track record of fundamental strength from our de-risked key growth pillars. We begin the year with confidence that we will maintain this strong underlying growth, after taking into account the significant impact LAGEVRIO had during the height of the pandemic last year and are pleased to reflect this in our 2023 initial guidance. Importantly, our pipeline is advancing with significant progress across several late-stage programs. In Oncology, we have expansive research efforts, including our ambition to move treatment into earlier stage settings where there is higher potential for more favorable longer term outcomes for patients. In December, along with our partner Moderna, we were pleased to announce highly encouraging Phase 2 results for a personalized mRNA therapeutic cancer vaccine in combination with KEYTRUDA in the treatment of adjuvant melanoma. We are excited by the potential that this combination may have for patients across a range of tumor types. And last week, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of certain patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy, which Caroline and Dean will speak to. In Cardiovascular, we are exploring candidates across a broad range of diseases and have made substantial progress from just one year ago. At the American College of Cardiology conference, we will present data from the STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension and from the Phase 2 trial of MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor and we will also host an investor event to discuss these programs. In Vaccines, Instituto Butantan in Brazil, with whom we are collaborating for vaccine development, reported very encouraging topline results for their candidate for the prevention of dengue. These data will inform future development of our dengue vaccine, V181, and our efforts to address this critical public health challenge. Finally, through our business development efforts, we brought in four programs which will have phase three trial starts in 2023 and which have the opportunity to contribute meaningful growth during the latter half of this decade and into the next. We are following our disciplined approach to business development and we will act when scientific opportunity and value align. We have more to do, but I feel very good about the progress we made in 2022 and we believe that all of these efforts will lead to real benefits for patients and in turn for shareholders. We enter 2023 with confidence in the innovation engine we are building and our ability to deliver sustainable value for patients well into the next decade. We will continue to execute on our de-risked assets and act with urgency to advance and grow our pipeline. We are doing all of this with an approach to sustainability that is closely aligned to our overall business strategy. I am very confident in the short- and long-term outlook of our company, and I look forward to providing future updates.  With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. So, Carter, maybe I can just add on a little bit about the commercial opportunity. As Dean said, this will be a slower ramp, because we have to drive more people to get diagnosed early so that we can get them the care they need. But just to give you some sizing of this. If you look at 2023, there are about 230,000 people who were diagnosed with lung cancer in U.S. and the majority of that group was not diagnosed until they were in the metastatic setting. So if you think about it from a minority perspective, we would estimate about 120,000 people in the early-stage setting, of which only a quarter will have a section or have surgery and be in the Stage Ib to IIIa, which is what our label indicates. So you are looking at about 30,000 patients who would be the addressable population and then obviously, of that group, historically, only about half of those patients have gone on to receive treatment in the form of chemotherapy or IO. So that's obviously something we hope to change as we go forward, because we think the outcome will show that if you are resected, you should pursue KEYTRUDA in that setting and it's our goal over time not only to drive more patients in that segment. But, obviously, the more people we can get diagnosed early pre-metastatic, then actually we will expand the population over time. So we see this as a meaningful opportunity long-term that is going to take us time to ramp as we work to change the paradigm that's existed in the past. Thank you, Carter. Next question, please, Kelly? Great. Well, maybe, Andrew, I will start off and if Caroline or Dean want to jump in. But to give you a sense, obviously, we haven't given specific guidance to the LOE period. But just to ground everyone into facts, KEYTRUDA and our expectation will lose exclusivity in the United States in 2028 and in China in 2028. It leaves it in Europe in 2030 and in Japan in 2032. So, obviously, by shorthand, we refer to 2028, but the reality of it is over most of the markets and KEYTRUDA increasingly is becoming, as you know, a global product, it's spread out. But as we look at where we sit today, I would say, we feel good about the progress we have made. We are confident that we are on a path to sustainable growth into the next decade. Obviously, we have more work to do, but I would just point to you to a few proof points that I think support that. First of all, as we talked about in the last 18 months, we have made meaningful progress in our cardiovascular pipeline. We have eight potential approvals between 2025 and 2030. Obviously, the centerpiece of that is sotatercept and what we are seeing from the STELLAR data, which really was just quite phenomenal. If you look at that, we expect those products, that portfolio of opportunity on an unrisk adjusted basis to be in excess of $10 billion as you approach the mid-2030s. We recently discussed the fact we see the business development deals we have done. We have brought in new assets apart from KEYTRUDA, apart from Lynparza, Lenvima and WELIREG, that themselves, these new mechanisms, I would point you to things like Orion and Imago, those products, along with what we see in the ADC space as a portfolio, we think themselves have the potential for $10 billion or more of revenue as you get into the early to mid-2030s. So today we sit there with the expectation that we are starting to make meaningful progress and that excludes all the work we are doing to bring an incremental value to patients on KEYTRUDA. Obviously, as great as KEYTRUDA is, it still only has an overall response rate averaging around 30%. We need to deepen and drive better response. We are looking to do that through combinations and through other means to find ways to improve on KEYTRUDA. We are looking to continue to expand into new tumor types as well and clearly move into earlier lines of therapy where we believe we can start to move to a point that we can actually give people an extension of life, and hopefully, someday get to a point that we talk about cancer a chronic disease, not a fatal disease. Obviously, we have more to do there, but that is the aspiration and we have a lot of efforts underway to do that through what we are doing in IO combinations, IO/ADC combinations with our subcutaneous offering. And then, obviously, we are very excited recently about the deal we did with Moderna for the personalized cancer vaccine, which is really a therapeutic that we think, in combination with KEYTRUDA, while we are studying in first in melanoma, obviously, we believe, has the potential to move into broader tumor. So that in and of itself gives us a lot of confidence and we are doing similar activities with Lynparza, with Lenvima, and obviously, WELIREG it's in early days. So if you look at the total of that and I have even gotten into our Vaccines portfolio and what we see as excitement there, we feel like we have made a lot of progress. We have more to do, but that's why you hear me talk more about how do we build the sustainable engine to drive growth well into the next decade and that really should be a focus point, because I am confident, if we do that well, the LOE of KEYTRUDA will take curve itself. So Dean? Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please, Kelly. Great. Thank you, Evan. Next question please, Kelly. Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Kelly. Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question please, Kelly. No. I appreciate the question, Geoff. I think Dean covered it well. This is a very important part of our overall strategy as we think about moving into earlier lines of therapy and then to drive convenience and access for patients, which is very important. So it's meaningful and it's something we are going to pursue as fast as we can. Thanks, Geoff. Next question please, Kelly. Thanks, Mohit. Next question please, Kelly. Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Kelly. Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Kelly. Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question please, Kelly. Thank you, Umer. Last question please, Kelly. Thank you, Steve, and thank you everybody for your thoughtful questions. Please follow-up with me and the IR team if you have anything additional and we look forward to staying in touch. Take care."

            "name": "Dr. Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Today, I will provide notable updates since our last earnings call. We continue to make significant advancements and achieve important regulatory milestones. The fourth quarter marks the end of a successful year with progress made across Oncology, Vaccines, Infectious Diseases and Cardiology. Let me start with Oncology. We remain committed to transforming the landscape of cancer therapy with an ongoing focus on treating earlier stages of disease. We are pleased by the recent approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with Stage Ib, II or IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on the results of KEYNOTE-091. This approval provides for the very first time an adjuvant immunotherapy option for this patient population with Stage Ib disease and regardless of PD-L1 status. Beyond KEYNOTE-091, we have additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer including, KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant therapy in resectable Stage II, IIIa and IIIb disease, KEYNOTE-867 evaluating KEYTRUDA in patients undergoing stereotactic body radiotherapy with unresected Stage I or II disease, and KEYLYNK-012 studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage III disease. These trials are all part of our broader effort to treat earlier stages of cancers and further improve patient outcomes across tumor types, such as melanoma. Together with Moderna, we announced positive Phase 2 results for V940/mRNA-4157, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in recurrence free survival versus KEYTRUDA alone. This investigational personalized neoantigen therapy utilizes mRNA technology and is specifically tailored to target the unique mutational signature of each patient's tumor. We plan to discuss the results with regulators and initiate Phase 3 trials in multiple tumors this year. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. We also announced positive results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-966 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy. This trial demonstrated an improvement in overall survival for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable biliary tract cancer. In addition, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma. In November, we announced the acquisition of Imago Biosciences, which closed last month. Imago's lead candidate, bomedemstat, is a potentially first-in-class orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. It is currently being evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. The combined team is now focused on continuing to advance the ongoing clinical development programs. At the American Society of Hematology annual meeting, data were presented from multiple pipeline candidates including, favezelimab, our anti-LAG3 antibody, zilovertamab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, targeting ROR-1, nemtabrutinib, our oral reversible, non-covalent BTK inhibitor, as well as KEYTRUDA. Updated Phase 2 data for bomedemstat in essential thrombocythemia and advanced myelofibrosis were also presented. We continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. In the European Union, along with our partner, Astra Zeneca, we announced the approval for Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROpel trial. In China, based on the results of KEYNOTE-522 and KEYNOTE-394, we received approvals for KEYTRUDA in neoadjuvant / adjuvant high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. With our partners, Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA has accepted supplemental biologics license applications for KEYTRUDA with PADCEV, an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, for the first-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. The agency set a PDUFA date of April 21, 2023 for each application. Building on the clinical benefits observed with KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and antibody drug conjugates, we have focused on augmenting our tissue targeting candidates through business development. We announced the expansion of our agreement with Kelun Biotech with the addition of up to seven preclinical antibody drug conjugates. The collaboration leverages technology with the potential to yield a new generation of candidates designed to precisely target and deliver potent anticancer agents to the tumor site. This follows previously disclosed agreements for two clinical stage candidates, including MK-2870, an investigational TROP2 targeting ADC we are planning to advance into Phase 3 trials this year. We also expanded our collaboration with PeptiDream to include the discovery and development of peptide drug conjugates. This technology potentially provides for improved permeability and drug selectivity in targeting tumor tissue. Next to our Vaccines portfolio. We were encouraged by the progress scientists and clinicians at the Instituto Butantan in Brazil made in developing a single dose dengue vaccine candidate for registration in Brazil. We are collaborating with the team there to conduct a detailed analysis of these positive, topline Phase 3 results to determine next steps for our own dengue vaccine candidate, V181, currently in Phase 2 development. Merck's goal is to make V181 available outside of Brazil for populations at-risk for dengue. As Caroline noted, we are receiving positive feedback from the field regarding the recent launch of VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and remain confident in our population specific strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. VAXNEUVANCE offers strong protection, including in the first year of life, with robust immunity across all shared and unique serotypes. This is important because the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease is greatest in the first year of life for children. Also, we are on track and look forward to the Phase 3 results from our V116 program for the protection of adults this year. We, along with others in the industry, are making a real impact in our goal to help reduce cancer incidence. It was noteworthy that the American Cancer Society's recently published annual report on cancer facts and trends included the remarkable observation that there has been a 65% reduction in cervical cancer incidence in women 20 years old to 24 years old from 2012 through 2019. It is this type of finding that further reinforces Merck's commitment to bringing forward treatment and prevention options to help patients with this devastating disease. As part of this commitment, we are encouraged by the role GARDASIL continues to play in helping to prevent certain HPV related cervical cancers.  Turning to the broader portfolio. With the continued impact of COVID-19 in China, treatment options are urgently needed to help reduce the incidence of disease and burden on healthcare systems. We were pleased LAGEVRIO was granted conditional marketing authorization by China's National Medical Products Administration in December, for use in adult patients who have mild to moderate COVID-19 infection and a high risk of progressing to severe cases. I wish to reinforce something Rob mentioned. Please mark your calendars for March 6th where we will present detailed findings of the Phase 3 STELLAR trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and the Phase 2 results for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans. We will also host a live investor event to answer your questions. We look forward to bringing sotatercept as an important treatment option to patients and are currently working towards submission of the data from the STELLAR trial. We are in discussions with the FDA about submission of the data on a rolling basis, which is likely to result in a potential approval in early 2024. As we close out 2022, it is important to highlight that over the course of the year we made strong progress across therapeutic areas, modalities, stages of development and multiple business development transactions. In Oncology, we obtained several important regulatory approvals globally for KEYTRUDA and Lynparza, as well as advanced a number of programs evaluating earlier stage cancer regimens. In Vaccines, we received an important approval in pediatrics for VAXNEUVANCE. In addition, we were granted expanded authorizations in China and active recommendations were reinstated in Japan for GARDASIL. In HIV, we resumed our clinical development program for islatravir. And finally in cardiovascular disease, we made significant progress across our pulmonary arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia programs.  Taken together, we continue to deliver on our strategy of advancing promising candidates across multiple therapeutic areas. We have strong momentum across our pipeline and look forward to providing further updates on our progress in 2023. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Yeah. So I believe you are speaking about KEYNOTE-091. So I just want to take a broad view and then today view and the tomorrow view. So I would just count that the American Cancer Society in 2023, it's really remarkable. They suggest that for between 1991 and 2023, there's a massive reduction in lung cancer of 58%, 36% and KEYTRUDA has been critical in that story and now we are moving to early lung. The label is broad. It is regardless of PD-L1 and it reflects the clinical trial, where we demonstrated a 27% reduction. We are pushing into these earlier lines with other trials. But I think for what we need to set for is two things. We need to make it much more easier with scientific innovation other means to get subcu, I mean, to get KEYTRUDA and that's why we are very eager to push our subcu pembrolizumab with [inaudible] to face through this year. But we also need to do a lot to improve adherence to established guidelines, which currently only have 6% or so of individuals actually who should be screened in the United States. So, I think, with that, we have work to do in relationship to really taking this important advance and making it broadly available through to individuals who should be getting screened. Yeah. So there was a question on our TIGIT program, KEYTRUDA plus TIGIT. Just to remind everyone, we have nine ongoing trials. We have five Phase 3s. In fact, just recently, we opened up KEYVIBE-10, which is Phase 3 in early melanoma. In relationship to KEYVIBE-003, which I think is the question, we added the TPS greater than 50% as an endpoint. These are event driven, and as the events drive to statistically and clinically meaningful data, we will announce it appropriately. Yeah. So let me just state, I -- we will be starting a whole series of Phase 3 trials this year. I really appreciate your question. For me, the critical thing is, whether it be an ADC or whether it be a RAS inhibitor in solid tumors, especially as you want to advance them in solid tumors where IO has been important, the combination benefit of the two becomes really important. So we are very excited to be pushing forward our TROP2 ADC. I can get into the details of the molecules and the linkers and the payloads and the darts. But really, the better sort of thing is, I believe that this year, we will be presenting our Phase 2 studies, and at the end of the day, that will be the most convincing data to provide to you as to why we think we have been important play with our TROP2 ADC, but it's also the play of that TROP2 ADC in relationship to adding it to an IO agent. We think that is an important considerations when thinking about any cancer killing mechanism in solid tumors. Thank you very much. So, first, I don't want to get ahead too much of our March 6 Investor meeting where we are least showing the data that we have in relationship to the oral PCSK9 and sotatercept. I will just sort of emphasize what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish is we are trying to accomplish the most potent LDL lowering oral pill for lowering cholesterol. There should be no co-chain, there should be very little need to interact with the healthcare system, which makes it reach very easy and very accessible, not just in the U.S. but globally. And we need to do it at a price point of what I would call a branded oral medicine would be not in order to maximize the access. In relationship with Phase 3, there's a general set sort of view of how that is. One is you would drive it, because LDL lowering is such a clean biomarker. So that's something. But one would also have that, at the same time, drive towards outcomes, which is also going to be important. So our Phase 3 trial design is informed by the history of the field has been and what the FDA's regulatory sort of outline have been for others. Thank you very much. So you are speaking about the wonderful partnership that we have with Moderna in the personalized cancer vaccine. I just want to preface everything. What we have released is topline data in melanoma. That data will be presented sometime in the near-term where we present the data that we have for melanoma and we have work to do to move that into Phase 3. So I -- we have a lot of work to do just in melanoma. I am not going to speak ahead of a human data we have outside of that. But I would say two things that are really important. One is one can watch which of the tumors have sensitivity to an immune approach and one can watch about the clinical development with KEYTRUDA to sort of map out where you would think about doing that. The second issue that I would emphasize is that, when we are talking about an IO-IO strategy, which often people speak about, I view this personalized neoantigen therapy as an IO-IO strategy with KEYTRUDA. And the reason I want to emphasize that is, there is a view that we are beginning to develop that IO-IO strategies may be especially useful in early cancer stages and you see that in our interest in our combination projects related to checkpoint inhibitors, but also in relationship to personalized neoantigen therapy. And so we think that, that's around that we are going to advance and the critical component for us to be able to advance that is to advance KEYTRUDA as a monotherapy in indications, because it creates us to actually do these clinical trials. So thank you very much for that question. I think it's on -- we will be -- when we talk about starting 10 to 15 Phase 3 clinical trials, just in Oncology, this subcu program is a critical component to that and we will be starting those Phase 3 this year. What are we seeking to achieve? I have talked about the early cancer space. Early cancer space, I think, is really important just from a medical standpoint of where we can intact really the outcomes of patients. We can markedly improve that. If you are going to go in the early space, whether it's neoadjuvant or adjuvant, from my clinical training, working with lung cancer doctors and oncologists, our ability to limit the need for individuals to constantly come to infusion centers is very important and we need to have the scientific innovation to do that. In doing that, we have to think carefully about how do we give as much optionality to three weeks to six weeks in that subcu regimen and that's what we are trying to drive through in our Phase 3 trials. Rob, did you want to answer anything else? Yeah. Thank you very much. I will just emphasize that as a general rule the way that I have begun to develop my view of IO-IO strategies, is that IO-IO strategies are very important to pursue. I think that IO-IO strategies plus other therapies that kill cancers may be especially important in the metastatic, but IO-IO strategies in the early stage could be quite impactful. And so, as I have just said, we have advanced our IO-IO strategy. We have advanced it with TIGIT CTLA-4 and LAG-3, so another component part. But I would just say this, I don't know that there's one single addition to KEYTRUDA that will have the breadth of KEYTRUDA. So we have been a little bit selective there and I think the movement of IO-IO, not just in the metastatic space, but especially in the early space will become important. And the ability to do that requires your first IO of that IO-IO to be approved in the early space and that is why we are so excited about moving into earlier spaces with KEYTRUDA, because that allows us to execute in an IO-IO strategy in early-stage cancers. Yeah. So, again, March 6th, clinical trial data for sotatercept will be more fully discussed. I think it will be very impactful data and I have no indication at this point that we will need a readout from any other trial from a clinical standpoint to support our filing to the FDA for 10%. Yeah. Well, thank you for that question. In relationship to TIGIT, I mean, we are very confident on our molecule. As I have said, we have nine ongoing five Phase 3 trials. Pushing the boundaries of what pembro can do or PD-1 can do with another IO agent has been something that's very important for the field. And the way that I can simply answer your question about the confidence the molecule is, we just opened an additional KEYVIBE study, a Phase 3 study in the earlier stages of cancer for this IO-IO combination. Yeah. So I would just want to elevate the question a little bit. The focus of what we are trying to do is we are trying to drive the concept of inhibition of checkpoint inhibitors can really have a profound effect throughout cancers in all stages in all tumor types. We talk about expand into different tissue types and stages, deepen in combination and extend with routes of delivery, roots of indentation and frequent safety and these innovations are critically important to make sure that this life saving sort of treatment is available. And we are confident in those innovations providing benefit to patients and we have filed where appropriate intellectual property for it -- for that. We will be talking about the detailed data from the PCSK9. We believe that it's very clean. But I will just step back as a cardiologist who trained in the late 1980s and 1990s, the ability to have an oral drug that lowered LDL cholesterol was impactful for the world. Yes, every oral drug, regardless of what therapy it is, has a compliance, so it's very important to maintain clients. What we are trying to do is to create the most potent LDL cholesterol lowering pill ever made that does not require constant interactions with a healthcare system, we think that, that axis is actually one that's very important, not just in the U.S., but also globally. And this is personally speaking, as someone who practices early, as of late, as recently as five years ago. If I had an oral PCSK9 LDL lowering pill back then, I would be prescribing it with the other three to four oral pills that I am prescribing an individual."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. Our strong performance this quarter reflects sustained momentum across our key growth drivers and steady progress in our pipeline. We are well positioned to successfully close out the year and we look forward to building on this momentum in 2023 and beyond. We are delivering across our strategic priorities and executing well scientifically, operationally and commercially. As a result, our pipeline is advancing, our business is healthy, our growth pillars are intact, and our financial performance is strong. We remain keenly focused on sustaining the success by driving continued growth and delivering long-term value to patients and shareholders. With that, let\u2019s turn first to our results. We are pleased to report exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth again this quarter. We continue to see robust demand for our innovative human and animal health portfolios, including for products such as KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and BRAVECTO. Our updated guidance reflects our expectation of truly standout full year growth. Moving to our research organization, we have made considerable progress across multiple therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular, the top line results of the STELLAR Phase 3 trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension achieved successful outcomes across both the primary and almost every secondary endpoint, suggesting the potential to transform the treatment of patients suffering from this devastating disease. I am proud of the way our research organization has moved swiftly following last year\u2019s acquisition of Acceleron to advance sotatercept\u2019s development. We continue to advance other programs across our broad cardiovascular pipeline, including our Factor XI inhibitor, which recently received an FDA Fast Track designation for patients with end-stage renal disease. Turning to oncology, we presented encouraging results at ESMO across our broad portfolio and promising pipeline. Long-term survival data reinforces the durable benefits of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for certain patients. We remain enthusiastic about the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of cancer as well as in combination with other agents. In vaccines, we launched VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and are progressing our Phase 3 trial of V116 in adults, an important component of our population-specific approach to invasive pneumococcal disease and part of our broader efforts to provide strong protection to both infants and adults. And finally, in HIV, we are pleased that there is a path forward for islatravir clinical trials in the treatment setting. We remain committed to helping address unmet needs in both treatment and prevention. Moving to our efforts around sustainability, we continue to execute on our priorities, further demonstrating our longstanding commitment to delivering value to society, which in turn, creates value for shareholders. In August, we published our annual ESG progress report, which provides a comprehensive review of our sustainability strategy, initiatives underway and progress against our goals. Consistent with our mission, we are focused on access to health, ensuring that our inventions reach as many patients as possible. To enable access, we are committed to responsibly discovering and manufacturing our medicines and vaccines, to bringing our best ideas forward through the empowerment of our talented and diverse employees and to always operating with strong ethics and values. Some of our initiatives include a commitment to providing 91.5 million doses of HPV vaccines in Gavi-supported countries, advancing our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and supporting projects and partnerships in our priority areas through the issuance of an inaugural $1 billion sustainability bond. Our approach to sustainability helps propel and enable our business strategy in ways that align with our operating priorities. This makes us a better company and global citizen, creating value for society and for shareholders. Yesterday evening, we also announced that Ken Fraser will be retiring from his role as Chairman of Merck\u2019s Board of Directors at the end of November. I know I speak on behalf of the entire company and our Board in expressing our deepest appreciation for Ken, his principal leadership, respect for science, passion for engaging with employees everywhere, commitment to patients and health equity and contributions to communities around the world. Speaking personally, I am deeply grateful for the inspiration, mentorship and support Ken has provided to me. Moving ahead, I look forward to working with the Board in my new role as Chairman as we continue to build on Ken\u2019s legacy and drive core to our purpose of using leading-edge science to save and improve lives globally. I am confident that we have the fundamental building blocks in place to achieve sustainable growth and value creation. This is exemplified by our talented team of scientists and our colleagues all around the world who are dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering life-changing medicines and vaccines. I am very confident in the short and long-term outlook of our company and I look forward to continuing to share progress as we move into the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2022 continues to be a year of excellent performance for our business. This quarter, we again achieved exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. These results reinforce our commitment to our science-led strategy, enabled by the flawless execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short-term, while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Total company revenues were $15 billion, an increase of 14%. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered strong growth of 10%. Underlying growth was 4 percentage points higher given the growing headwind from foreign exchange. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its momentum with growth of 19%, or 15% excluding LAGEVRIO, driven by strength across our key pillars. Our Animal Health business delivered a solid quarter as sales increased 4% in both our companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.4 billion driven by strong global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Intervening earlier in cancer progression provides the potential for better patient outcomes, which is why we remain excited by the impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with these early-stage cancers. Notably, there continues to be very strong demand in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer a testament to the profound effect KEYTRUDA is having for patients with this aggressive form of disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Recently approved earlier stage indications, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, are off to a strong start following launches in key European markets earlier this year. Lynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Our alliance revenue grew 23% driven by continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA study. The outlook for Lynparza remains strong. And if approved, we are confident in the potential to reach patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 11%, a strong demand in the U.S. driven by continued uptake in advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer was partially offset by shipment timing in China. Lastly, WELIREG is performing consistent with our expectations, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need of patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our vaccines portfolio achieved excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 20% to $2.3 billion. Growth is being driven by strong underlying demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. We recently received approval from China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration to expand the use of GARDASIL 9 to girls and women 9 to 45 years of age, which will further expand our opportunity in this important market. Growth in the U.S. was due to timing of CDC purchases, which will negatively impact fourth quarter sales. We are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth of GARDASIL given its proven effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and other diseases. Global immunization levels remain low, which provides us a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we have invested aggressively in manufacturing capacity, which positions us well to supply the demand we expect to see now and over the long-term. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 22%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. As mentioned earlier, Animal Health sales increased 4%. Livestock sales increased due to poultry products and ruminant technology solutions. Companion animal sales growth was driven by the BRAVECTO line of products, partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, reflecting favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of lower margin LAGEVRIO and supply sales. Operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes $619 million of payments related to certain collaborations and licensing agreements. Excluding these payments, operating expenses grew 13%, driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $100 million, which reflects lower pension expense compared to last year. Our tax rate was 13.6%. Taken together, we earned $1.85 per share, which includes $0.22 of charges related to significant collaboration and licensing agreement. Excluding these charges, we had exceptional underlying growth. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.5 billion and $59 billion, including LAGEVRIO sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 20% to 21%. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of nearly 1% using mid-October rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of approximately 4%. Excluding foreign exchange and LAGEVRIO, we expect growth of approximately 16%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing and narrowing our operating expense projection to $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion, principally driven by a $250 million payment related to the recent exercise of our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine as part of our ongoing collaboration with Moderna. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We continue to assume other expense of approximately $500 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 14%. We assume 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased and narrowed our expected EPS range to $7.32 to $7.37, an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint. The operational momentum in our business would have led to an approximately $0.20 increase in our guidance. However, it is being partially offset by the option payments in Moderna and an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of nearly 1% using mid-October rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We continue to demonstrate strong momentum and expect durable underlying demand across our key pillars, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. As you consider your model, there are a few items to keep in mind. While we actively manage foreign exchange through our revenue hedging program, it continues to be a headwind to growth, particularly across products with a larger portion of international revenues, such as in our Animal Health business. The hedging program mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. And to the extent we continue to see foreign exchange headwinds recorded at the product level, we will see a benefit in other revenues. In addition, other revenue includes the supply sales to Organon. As you saw in our results, PNEUMOVAX23 is experiencing pressure, particularly in the U.S. as the market continues to shift towards newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to prioritize investments in our pipeline and business to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We have made significant progress across our pipeline which Dean will speak to that has the potential to drive sustainable revenue growth. We are augmenting our pipeline by steering the best external science through value-enhancing business development, which we will invest in to realize the promise of these products. We continue to consider the full breadth of the business development landscape. We have ample balance sheet capacity and we will act only when science and value align. Should meaningful business development not materialize and depending on the pipeline of potential transactions, we will opportunistically buyback shares. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong and we continue to demonstrate the operational momentum and commercial execution that will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the second quarter call. We have growing momentum in our pipeline across therapeutic areas, across modalities, across stages of development and across the spectrum of internal programs, established partnerships and recent business development opportunities. In cardiology, we are making strong headway in pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as our PCSK9 and Factor XI program. In vaccines, we are moving with rigor and speed to build on the VAXNEUVANCE approval and established a suite of tailored pneumococcal vaccines. In oncology, we are expanding our portfolio in partnerships with Orion, [indiscernible] and most recently, Moderna. This progress strengthens my confidence in the pipeline and reinforces to me the opportunity presented by several candidates poised to positively impact patients\u2019 lives. As Rob noted, we see significant opportunity to make an impact in cardiovascular disease. Earlier this month, we announced top line results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept, added to currently approved standard of care, had a profound effect on the primary efficacy outcome measure of improvement in 6-minute walk distance from baseline at 24 weeks. Of note, 8 out of 9 secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement and the outcome measure of time to death for the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. We look forward to sharing the results with regulatory authorities and plan to present the findings at a scientific congress in 2023. The data from the STELLAR trial is an important milestone as we work to establish a beachhead in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Looking ahead, the ZENITH trial is evaluating sotatercept for morbidity and mortality and will enable assessment of the potential to reverse progression of disease and will be followed by the HYPERION trial, which is designed to evaluate whether administration of sotatercept earlier in the course of PH can help improve outcomes and delay time to clinical worsening. And we also have a Phase 2 CADENCE trial, which is exploring the potential for sotatercept in left heart failure. In addition to sotatercept, we are studying MK-5475, an investigational inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator designed to provide selective pulmonary arterial vasodilation with limited systemic exposure for the treatment of PAH. We remain confident in the promise of our investigational portfolio to fundamentally change the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Next to LAGEVRIO. Approximately 2. 5 million people have now received LAGEVRIO for the treatment of COVID-19, and studies are continuing to show the impact this oral treatment option is having on patients and on healthcare system. Real-world evidence of high-risk, older population conducted in Israel and Hong Kong found a reduction in hospitalization and death, consistent with the Phase 3 move-out clinical trial. Unsurprisingly, a large study in the UK evaluating a broader highly vaccinated population conducted during the omicron era found no difference in hospitalization versus standard of care. Nevertheless, there were important observations from certain secondary analysis, including quicker time to recovery and to symptom alleviation as well as reduced physician visits. LAGEVRIO continues to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with our findings in move-out. The pandemic continues to evolve and vaccination rates still vary substantially from country to country. More reason variants, such as omicron, are generally associated with less severe disease. But the elderly and those with comorbidities remain at high risk of poor outcome. Insights from real-world studies are important in this context as we try to understand how LAGEVRIO is being used and the potential benefit for various patient populations. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important tool in the armamentarium to treat COVID-19, especially with uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. In addition to COVID-19, we are now taking steps to harness the broad antiviral potential of LAGEVRIO. We have initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating its use in the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and will provide further updates as they become available. Shifting to our HIV portfolio, since last year\u2019s setback to the islatravir program, we have gained tremendous learning and insights through the evaluation of data. Following consultation with the FDA, we are pleased we have a path forward. We initiated a new Phase 3 clinical program evaluating a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and a lower dose of islatravir for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection. In addition, the Phase 2 study with Gilead evaluating a weekly oral combination treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed is resuming with a lower dose of islatravir. We continue to see significant potential in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor mechanism and remain committed to addressing the unmet need in both treatment and in prevention of HIV. In the PeEP setting, we are prioritizing an internal novel NRTTI compounds for development. Next to vaccine and specifically GARDASIL-9. As Caroline noted, last month, the National Medical Products Administration in China expanded the authorization for GARDASIL-9 to broader age rates. The authorization reinforces the strong clinical profile of GARDASIL-9 and its effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and diseases. In addition, we were pleased with the recent approval of VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by the European Commission in the pediatric calculation. This approval brings an important treatment option to vulnerable populations, including infants less than 1 year of age, who typically experience the highest rate of disease. I would also like to touch on the recently announced collaboration with Orna Therapeutics. We have made significant investments and gained important insights into the use of RNA technology. The compelling circular RNA platform that Orna has developed allows us to explore the potential for a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics. Turning to oncology. Strong momentum continues in our oncology portfolio across tumor type and stages of disease. Last month, at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting, we showcased long-term survival benefit data for KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer as well as for Lynparza in ovarian cancer. In addition, we presented data that continues to support the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage disease. Our expansive research efforts in treating in earlier-stage setting reflects our ambition to treat cancer when the potential of curing cancer may be high. Also at ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, first-time data was presented from the Phase 1b/2 EV-103 for KEYNOTE-869 cohort K trial. KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin-ejfv demonstrated encouraging objective response rate as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There remain a high unmet medical need for new medicines for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and we look forward to the potential of this combination. This quarter, we received priority review for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer regardless of their genetic mutation status based on the PROpel study. the PDUFA date has been set for the fourth quarter. Outside of the U.S., we continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. There remains significant opportunity for us to help improve patient outcomes and address unmet need in Japan and in China. We received four new approvals in Japan based on KEYNOTE-522 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-564 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma following surgery; KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage 2b or Stage 2c melanoma; and KEYNOTE-826 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. For Lynparza, we received approval in the EU and Japan for the adjuvant treatment for patients with certain types of high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA A trial and in China as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Finally, we exercised our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, or V940, which our partner, Moderna, is currently evaluating in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase 2 study for patients with locally advanced and resected melanoma. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study is to assess efficacy of a personalized cancer vaccine plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in a randomized study of early-stage melanoma in the adjuvant setting. We are energized to continue our collaboration with Moderna, a pioneer in mRNA vaccine technology. To conclude, there has been substantive progress across our pipeline, and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress in the future. And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Leo, will you please start the Q&A? [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Pleas go ahead.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much. I guess my question was on capital deployment. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that if BD doesn\u2019t materialize based on the progression of the pipeline, you\u2019d consider repo at some point down the line. So I guess on that front, how are you thinking about the overall business development landscape at this point? And has your preference on \u2013 or I guess actionability of kind of larger deals versus Acceleron type tuck-ins evolved at all as we have gone through this year. I know it\u2019s obviously a big kind of point of debate on the Merck story. So I just love to hear your kind of latest thinking on kind of BD landscape. And are we getting closer to a point where maybe repo makes sense just given the cash that seems to be kind of accumulating at the company? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. Great, Chris. Thanks for the question, and I\u2019ll ask Caroline to comment specifically on the share repurchase side of the question. But just for the BD landscape, we continue to, frankly, see a portfolio of opportunities we are interested in and are continuing to look at. So as we sit here today, our focus, our urgency on business development has not changed. We do see a list of potential places to play. Obviously, we got to bring them through to fruition which we\u2019re working to do. That is our priority because we continue to believe the best thing we can do for long-term value creation is to invest in the sustainability of our business, which is investing in the pipeline of the future in both what we do internally and through BD. So that\u2019s our priority. And I do see opportunities. But obviously, we remain committed also to not hold cash. So with that, maybe I\u2019ll let Caroline comment specifically on the share repurchase.\nCaroline Litchfield: So Chris, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We seek to provide a competitive return to our shareholders through both the dividend that we pay and we expect will grow, as well as through share repurchases, while we balance the need to invest in our business in driving growth, as well as in our business development strategies, as Robert just outlined. Given where we are, with our focus on business development, our desire to not create excess cash on the balance sheet, we will look opportunistically at share buybacks based on our assessment of that BD pipeline.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Leo.\nOperator: Next question is from Daina Graybosch with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nDaina Graybosch: Yes. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your novel pneumococcal vaccine strategy, V116 and V117 and how you think that will compete ultimately with competitor vaccines that continue to increase in their serotype 3?\nDean Li: This is Dean. I\u2019ll take that, and thank you very much for the question. So the top line is, I would just emphasize that our view is that more serotype is not always better and one size does not fit all. Our view and the view that I\u2019ve had when I practice medicine, it\u2019s the right medicine or, in this case, the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. So when you look at VAXNEUVANCE, which is our 15 valent, which has recurrent responses for serotype 3, but also 22F and 33F. If you look at that and you have to look at the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease, it\u2019s a bimodal curve where really in the first 2 years of life, especially in the first year of life, is really important. And then in the adult section, you realize that there is increasing at 45, 55, 65. So there is a bimodal curve. If you also lay down the different serotypes, the serotypes are quite different between the two. So that\u2019s why we believe it\u2019s the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. Now we have a pediatric V114 that has ACIP that\u2019s gone through. And in terms of differentiation and relationship to pediatrics, we don\u2019t have clear view of other vaccines, but we are very confident in our ability to give coverage in the first year. And data to date might suggest that, that is an important differentiation in a pediatric study. There is some questions in relationship to top line serotypes that\u2019s been sort of laid out. There has been some discussion of 6 serotype 2 substantial which we can\u2019t really comment on that differentiation, until we know exactly what serotypes and what the real detailed data. In relationship to the adult market, this gives us great insight and great enthusiasm for V116, our 21-valent vaccine. Now that one is specifically targeted for the serotypes that are important for the adult. So it\u2019s 21-valent, but I would just emphasize that 11 serotypes in the 21 valent for V116 is not shared by PCV20. And the reason is that we\u2019re focused on the adult disease, and we are targeting 85% of residual invasive pneumococcal disease. And I would \u2013 if I look at the vaccines that are in Phase 3, but also Phase 2 or Phase 1 with recent data, I don\u2019t know that anyone else has a vaccine that\u2019s targeting 85% of the residual invasive pneumococcal disease. So more is not better, one size does not fit all the right vaccine, the right patient at the right time.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Daina. Next question please, Leo.\nOperator: Next is Colin Bristow with UBS. Please go ahead.\nColin Bristow: Hey, good morning, and congrats on the results. A great quarter for GARDASIL, but you talk about the sort of the one-time impact of CDC purchase timing. Can you just quantify the level of impact that had? And then I just wanted to touch base on the additional supply coming online in \u201823 \u201824, and \u201825. Is this still on track? And could you just specify where the supply is coming from geographically? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: This is Caroline. I\u2019ll take a shot at answering your question. So GARDASIL continues to be a very strong growth driver for our company and will be long into the future given to date only 9% of the world\u2019s eligible population are vaccinated. In terms of the quarter results, we saw growth in the U. S., which was largely driven by the CDC timing. In the third quarter of 2021, there was an approximate $125 million buy-in by the CDC. In the third quarter of \u201822, there was an approximate buy-in of $250 million. So year-over-year, that contributed to growth to the tune of approximately $120 million plus. We do expect the majority of that buy-in by the CDC in the third quarter to come out during the fourth quarter. As we look at our opportunity to satisfy the global demand and protect as many lives as we can going forward, we will be supported by the increased supply and capacity that we have coming online commencing 2023. And we expect that, that additional supply will come online over the course of \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825. And therefore, we remain very confident in our ability to protect more lives, to drive growth long into the future, including doubling the revenue of GARDASIL in the year 2030 compared to where we were in 2021.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Colin. Next question please Leo.\nOperator: Next is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks so much for the question. So, I really wanted to ask a question on sotatercept and perhaps the endpoints that surprised you the most. The feedback that we are getting from thought leaders is that the benefit on clinical worsening actually coming as early as it did was a genuine surprise and suggests upside. Just wondering, Dean, where you fit in that point of discussion and perhaps what you are looking forward to in some of the earlier-stage clinical studies for sotatercept? Thanks.\nDean Li: Thank you very much for that question. So, yes, we gave top line results. We are moving with speed to present those data to regulatory authorities throughout. But just to step back, I just want to remind, at least myself and every \u2013 and others that we were drawn to the sotatercept mechanism because it was a unique mechanism of action. It\u2019s the rebalance activin and BMP signaling. The other mechanisms of action could largely be viewed as vasodilatory, and we have a very strong program in trying to make the best [indiscernible] medicine. But the mechanism of action you would expect for sotatercept, you would expect it would potentially reprogram the cellular response and essentially be disease modifying. We are excited about the results. We know that there was a profound effect on six-minute walk. But as you emphasized, time to clinical worsening, these multi-components are all really important and they came in clinically meaningful and statistically significant. So, we are hopeful that we can potentially reshape the treatment of PAH. I would emphasize that we talk about HYPERION, venous and CADENCE. But VICTORIA, which is the follow-on program. And the reason why that is really important to me is given the results that I see, I very much want the individuals who were on the STELLAR trial have the opportunity to get into VICTORIA, which is an open-label trial, because the effects that we see that will be reported in a meeting likely in 2023 are ones where we must make sure that those individuals who were recruited to STELLAR have continued access to sotatercept. That\u2019s how important we think the results are.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Seamus. Next question please Leo.\nOperator: Next is Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. Rob, you have been CEO for 16 months and now you are going to be Chairman. What do you view as your greatest accomplishments during this time? And what have been the greatest disappointments? I think given the comments you made when you took over, we might have expected more to be done more quickly to build the pipeline, especially since Merck\u2019s pipeline is the second smallest in global pharma. Do you think this is a fair assertion? And if so, why haven\u2019t things changed more quickly? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, it\u2019s been a fast six months \u2013 or 16 months in the role. But I would say what I am most proud of, several things. One, the way the organization has come together as one team and really brought more focus in the business. Obviously, the spin-off of Organon, I think was very successful, has given us more simple structures, more focus that I feel very good about. Our progress on business development, obviously, the fact that we moved so quickly with Acceleron and then you heard what are just really exceptional results coming out of the STELLAR study, feel very proud about. But I would say also just overall the way our team has continued to just execute really flawlessly, scientifically, operational, commercially, I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what everyone is doing. We have come together and we are really delivering for all of those things I would say I am very proud about. On the pipeline itself, I actually think we are making a lot of progress. The fact that a year ago won\u2019t even give us credit for having a cardiovascular pipeline. And today, we talk about the fact that by the \u201824 to \u201828 timeframe, we could be having as many as eight new approvals driving revenue that could be in excess of $10 billion by the mid-2030s across the whole suite of assets, some developed internally and obviously some brought into business development, like what we did with Acceleron. So, I feel very good about that. The progress we are making in vaccines, what we are seeing. I think VAXNEUVANCE is underappreciated. There is a notion that Dean laid out of really having a bespoke approach where we were able to cover more of the serotypes that cause disease, whether it be in infants, and then selectively and differently, those in adults. We think that\u2019s a real game changer. Our growing pipeline in neuroscience and immunology, I could go on and on, and the strength that we are continuing to have in adding to our oncology pipeline. So, do I think we have everything we need, no. But do I think we have made great progress in a year, I actually think we have, and it gives me confidence that we are going to continue to drive progress. The fact that we did three important business development deals this quarter alone, spanning mRNA technologies, into circular RNA technologies, personalized cancer vaccines and then more traditional oncology agents with a really novel mechanism, those all are adding to the future promise we have in this company. So, I actually feel very good about that. More to do, but confidence in what we have done so far.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks Steve. Next question please Leo.\nOperator: Next is Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nMara Goldstein: Great. Excuse me. Thanks so much for the question. I wanted to ask about the cardiovascular business actually since it was just mentioned. And given the pending applications for sotatercept, where you feel that, that organization from a commercial perspective needs to go, or are you right-sized to be able to launch and maximize sotatercept in the near-term?\nRob Davis: Yes. Maybe I can start that and Caroline or Dean can add on. If you look \u2013 if you go back in history, Merck has actually had a strong history and legacy in cardiovascular. And a lot of the \u2013 if you will, the muscle memory still exists in our organization. So, I am very confident that we have what it takes. But more importantly, we are already out there right now in PAH. We have Adempas. We have Verquvo. So, we have people calling on these doctors. Recall what drove us to think about Acceleron was what we saw in our pipeline, but also what we saw commercially through that experience. So, we do have the capabilities. And also the other thing I would point out is this is a little different than the way we used to think about the world. This is \u2013 in many cases, a lot of these drugs are still specialty drugs. They are not necessarily the true traditional primary care drugs of what we have seen in the past. And I think we are very well positioned. So, I have no worries about our confidence and ability to deliver this commercially. We have done it in the past, and we will do it again.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Mara. Next question please.\nOperator: Next is Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch up on oncology trials, two of them in particular. There is an ongoing subcu KEYTRUDA trial versus IV. I just \u2013 I was curious to gauge your confidence on that and if it\u2019s reasonable to assume that vast majority of the franchise that gets switched to subcu. And also this KEYTRUDA plus KRASG12C trial, curious if the early experience implies such a combination is feasible or not? Thank you.\nDean Li: I will take a shot at both of those questions. I will just emphasize that there is a continuing move to early cancer throughout the field, but especially at Merck. We have talked about the approval that we have in the early stage, both for Lynparza and KEYTRUDA. And this recent Merck-Moderna collaboration is to extend that. It\u2019s essentially an IO-IO combination, initially in melanoma, but with the possibility to expand, deepen and extend throughout other tumor types in different stages. So, given that, the critical thing for patients, especially in the early stage is to be able to have really excellent access to our medicines, and there is a need for scientific innovation. That is why we are advancing the subcu program. And we are confident that, that will not only be important and successful, but it will be really critical as we move into early phase because the ability cannot be linked to an infusion center. So, we are confident in our strategy of moving into early phase, and it is linked. Each scientific innovation required to improve access. In relationship with the RAS program, I have said previously that the RAS program of all of those who are advancing will require a combination. And the ability to move those programs such that you can have a dose and an ability to combine with other medicines is important. We have early data with our RAF inhibitor and many of the attributes that we think are required for that. We are big that the cards are looking like they could positively reflect on our KRAS program. But we will share that data, both in monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, at an appropriate time when we present that at a Congress.\nRob Davis: And Umer, to the specific question of the conversion, it\u2019s probably too early to get into the specifics of that. But I would say, generally, we do see this as bringing meaningful patient benefit. If you think about quality of life, as you move especially in the earlier stages of cancer, to be able to deliver the drug subcutaneously, we think is both innovative and will bring real value to the patients. So, that is part of the strategy as we look at the totality of how is it that we continue to deliver for patients as we extend our franchise. So, that\u2019s something we are looking at, but more details as we get further down the road.\nUmer Raffat: Great.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks Umer. Next question please.\nOperator: Next is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And staying on sotatercept, especially with the CADENCE study. So, we spoke to a doctor and he was very excited about the study given that there are no approved therapies in the subset of patients you are going after. Could you help us frame expectations of this study, because a lot of these endpoints are very similar to STELLAR. So, would you expect the similar level of efficacy or bar could be lower given there is no standard of care there? Thank you.\nDean Li: Yes. So, let me just speak to, we look at both our both sotatercept, and I would just also emphasize our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase are the same sort of general sense, which is we are willing to drive it into PAH. But when you look at the mechanism of action, you ask yourself, is there other places that you can affect diseases, that aren\u2019t pulmonary arterial hypertension, but diseases where you have pulmonary hypertension, such as diastolic heart failure or, for example, in lung disease. Our expectation is that we want to explore whether sotatercept and its unique mechanism of rebalancing certain molecular pathways could also be applied to those patients who have diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. And given the impact that sotatercept has that we have seen already with PAH, that gives us a little bit more confidence that that mechanism may be applicable to those people with diastolic heart failure. Equivalent is as we moved our in-house soluble guanylate cyclase.\nOperator: I am sorry, your conference will end in five minutes.\nDean Li: In PAH, we are also evaluating whether that molecule could also be used in those patients with lung disease who have pulmonary hypertension. So, the results give us more confidence at the next step.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Mohit. Next question please Leo.\nOperator: Next question Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. One moment here and you may go ahead Chris.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. To follow on Steve\u2019s question to Rob in terms of the response about what you are most proud about. You talked about the successful implications of spinning off the Organon business and having an organization have a little bit of a simpler structure and focus. I want to juxtapose the question of the animal health business. Talk a little bit about your views these days in terms of how that fits the capital allocation priorities, whether you envision potential for that to be a strategic step that you would consider to perhaps separate that business. Thank you.\nRob Davis: Sure. Chris, thanks for the question. As we have said in the past, we are always looking at the portfolio. We were always asking what is the best structure to develop and generate long-term value for our business and for our shareholders. And with that view, we continue to believe that the animal health business is a key growth driver for us. It brings a lot of synergies, frankly, in both directions. Obviously, they are benefiting from their ability to access the science on the human health side. We are benefiting from the value they bring and, in some cases, frankly, on the vaccine side, some of the manufacturing technologies are actually being brought over into the human health side. So, we do see synergies in these two businesses. We continue to believe that our ability to invest fully to optimize the opportunity in animal health is there. I think we have demonstrated that to the capital we have deployed and that capital is paying off. And I don\u2019t believe that business would have the capital it\u2019s had to grow if it wasn\u2019t part of Merck. So, it\u2019s benefiting from what we can bring to them. We are benefiting from what it brings to us and as of now we continue to see it as a strategic asset. So, no plans to look at spinning it.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks Chris. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nLuisa Hector: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a little bit more on islatravir, given your confidence to continue development. Can you say any more about the impact the drug is having on lymphocytes at the lower dose? Clearly, you are able to move forward to the regulator is happy. Is there some level of lymphocyte reduction that the regulator will accept? And how should we think about the risk of resistance development with the lower dose? And when might we see some Phase 3 data? Thank you.\nDean Li: Thank you very much for that question. So, I just want to emphasize that islatravir is one molecule in our suite of NRTTI molecule. And as you mentioned, we are very interested in the importance of this body of molecules and mechanism, both for the prep setting and for the treatment setting. And it has the possibility of really transforming the longer-acting space. Specifically to your question, we have a large range of clinical data as many\u2026\nOperator: We are sorry, your conference will end in one minute.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Excuse me, Dean. Leo, our conference will continue past 9:00 a.m.\nOperator: We are attempting to make sure that happens, sir.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you. We are prepared to go a few extra minutes.\nDean Li: And so we have a plethora of clinical data. We are very confident that the 0.25 milligrams will be effective. We are confident that the effects on lymphocytes and CD4 T-cells will be comparable to any standard antiviral. And so that\u2019s in the Q day. We are also very interested in moving to the Q week with our partner, Gilead. And hopefully, that will begin to get posted more, but we are focusing on amending the protocol and the dosing regimen under the guidance of the FDA. And I also want to emphasize that we will continue to be committed on the two-month oral. I mean just think, 12 pills a year, 12 pills a year for patients who are high-risk take with PREP. We have MK-8527, it is a different molecule in our suite of NRTTIs.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: We are sorry your conference is ending now. Please hang up.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Okay. So for those that are still on the line, thank you very much. We\u2019ll have to close the call there because of those technical difficulties. For those that were in the queue, please follow up with IR and we\u2019ll hope to get your questions answered. Thank you all very much.",

            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the second quarter call. We have growing momentum in our pipeline across therapeutic areas, across modalities, across stages of development and across the spectrum of internal programs, established partnerships and recent business development opportunities. In cardiology, we are making strong headway in pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as our PCSK9 and Factor XI program. In vaccines, we are moving with rigor and speed to build on the VAXNEUVANCE approval and established a suite of tailored pneumococcal vaccines. In oncology, we are expanding our portfolio in partnerships with Orion, [indiscernible] and most recently, Moderna. This progress strengthens my confidence in the pipeline and reinforces to me the opportunity presented by several candidates poised to positively impact patients' lives. As Rob noted, we see significant opportunity to make an impact in cardiovascular disease. Earlier this month, we announced top line results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept, added to currently approved standard of care, had a profound effect on the primary efficacy outcome measure of improvement in 6-minute walk distance from baseline at 24 weeks. Of note, 8 out of 9 secondary efficacy outcome measures achieved statistical significance, including the outcome measure of proportion of participants achieving multicomponent improvement and the outcome measure of time to death for the first occurrence of a clinical worsening event. We look forward to sharing the results with regulatory authorities and plan to present the findings at a scientific congress in 2023. The data from the STELLAR trial is an important milestone as we work to establish a beachhead in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Looking ahead, the ZENITH trial is evaluating sotatercept for morbidity and mortality and will enable assessment of the potential to reverse progression of disease and will be followed by the HYPERION trial, which is designed to evaluate whether administration of sotatercept earlier in the course of PH can help improve outcomes and delay time to clinical worsening. And we also have a Phase 2 CADENCE trial, which is exploring the potential for sotatercept in left heart failure. In addition to sotatercept, we are studying MK-5475, an investigational inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator designed to provide selective pulmonary arterial vasodilation with limited systemic exposure for the treatment of PAH. We remain confident in the promise of our investigational portfolio to fundamentally change the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Next to LAGEVRIO. Approximately 2. 5 million people have now received LAGEVRIO for the treatment of COVID-19, and studies are continuing to show the impact this oral treatment option is having on patients and on healthcare system. Real-world evidence of high-risk, older population conducted in Israel and Hong Kong found a reduction in hospitalization and death, consistent with the Phase 3 move-out clinical trial. Unsurprisingly, a large study in the UK evaluating a broader highly vaccinated population conducted during the omicron era found no difference in hospitalization versus standard of care. Nevertheless, there were important observations from certain secondary analysis, including quicker time to recovery and to symptom alleviation as well as reduced physician visits. LAGEVRIO continues to demonstrate a safety profile consistent with our findings in move-out. The pandemic continues to evolve and vaccination rates still vary substantially from country to country. More reason variants, such as omicron, are generally associated with less severe disease. But the elderly and those with comorbidities remain at high risk of poor outcome. Insights from real-world studies are important in this context as we try to understand how LAGEVRIO is being used and the potential benefit for various patient populations. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important tool in the armamentarium to treat COVID-19, especially with uncertainty surrounding the emergence of new variants and continued global surges. In addition to COVID-19, we are now taking steps to harness the broad antiviral potential of LAGEVRIO. We have initiated a Phase 2 trial evaluating its use in the treatment of Respiratory Syncytial Virus and will provide further updates as they become available. Shifting to our HIV portfolio, since last year's setback to the islatravir program, we have gained tremendous learning and insights through the evaluation of data. Following consultation with the FDA, we are pleased we have a path forward. We initiated a new Phase 3 clinical program evaluating a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and a lower dose of islatravir for the treatment of people with HIV-1 infection. In addition, the Phase 2 study with Gilead evaluating a weekly oral combination treatment regimen of islatravir and lenacapavir in adults with HIV-1 infection who are virologically suppressed is resuming with a lower dose of islatravir. We continue to see significant potential in the nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor mechanism and remain committed to addressing the unmet need in both treatment and in prevention of HIV. In the PeEP setting, we are prioritizing an internal novel NRTTI compounds for development. Next to vaccine and specifically GARDASIL-9. As Caroline noted, last month, the National Medical Products Administration in China expanded the authorization for GARDASIL-9 to broader age rates. The authorization reinforces the strong clinical profile of GARDASIL-9 and its effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and diseases. In addition, we were pleased with the recent approval of VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine by the European Commission in the pediatric calculation. This approval brings an important treatment option to vulnerable populations, including infants less than 1 year of age, who typically experience the highest rate of disease. I would also like to touch on the recently announced collaboration with Orna Therapeutics. We have made significant investments and gained important insights into the use of RNA technology. The compelling circular RNA platform that Orna has developed allows us to explore the potential for a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics. Turning to oncology. Strong momentum continues in our oncology portfolio across tumor type and stages of disease. Last month, at the European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting, we showcased long-term survival benefit data for KEYTRUDA in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and head and neck cancer as well as for Lynparza in ovarian cancer. In addition, we presented data that continues to support the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier-stage disease. Our expansive research efforts in treating in earlier-stage setting reflects our ambition to treat cancer when the potential of curing cancer may be high. Also at ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, first-time data was presented from the Phase 1b/2 EV-103 for KEYNOTE-869 cohort K trial. KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin-ejfv demonstrated encouraging objective response rate as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, metastatic urothelial cancer who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy. There remain a high unmet medical need for new medicines for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer, and we look forward to the potential of this combination. This quarter, we received priority review for Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as first-line treatment for patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer regardless of their genetic mutation status based on the PROpel study. the PDUFA date has been set for the fourth quarter. Outside of the U.S., we continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. There remains significant opportunity for us to help improve patient outcomes and address unmet need in Japan and in China. We received four new approvals in Japan based on KEYNOTE-522 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-564 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients with renal cell carcinoma following surgery; KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of certain patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage 2b or Stage 2c melanoma; and KEYNOTE-826 for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in certain patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. For Lynparza, we received approval in the EU and Japan for the adjuvant treatment for patients with certain types of high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA A trial and in China as first-line maintenance treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Finally, we exercised our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, or V940, which our partner, Moderna, is currently evaluating in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase 2 study for patients with locally advanced and resected melanoma. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study is to assess efficacy of a personalized cancer vaccine plus KEYTRUDA versus KEYTRUDA alone in a randomized study of early-stage melanoma in the adjuvant setting. We are energized to continue our collaboration with Moderna, a pioneer in mRNA vaccine technology. To conclude, there has been substantive progress across our pipeline, and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress in the future. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. This is Dean. I'll take that, and thank you very much for the question. So the top line is, I would just emphasize that our view is that more serotype is not always better and one size does not fit all. Our view and the view that I've had when I practice medicine, it's the right medicine or, in this case, the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. So when you look at VAXNEUVANCE, which is our 15 valent, which has recurrent responses for serotype 3, but also 22F and 33F. If you look at that and you have to look at the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease, it's a bimodal curve where really in the first 2 years of life, especially in the first year of life, is really important. And then in the adult section, you realize that there is increasing at 45, 55, 65. So there is a bimodal curve. If you also lay down the different serotypes, the serotypes are quite different between the two. So that's why we believe it's the right vaccine for the right patient at the right time. Now we have a pediatric V114 that has ACIP that's gone through. And in terms of differentiation and relationship to pediatrics, we don't have clear view of other vaccines, but we are very confident in our ability to give coverage in the first year. And data to date might suggest that, that is an important differentiation in a pediatric study. There is some questions in relationship to top line serotypes that's been sort of laid out. There has been some discussion of 6 serotype 2 substantial which we can't really comment on that differentiation, until we know exactly what serotypes and what the real detailed data. In relationship to the adult market, this gives us great insight and great enthusiasm for V116, our 21-valent vaccine. Now that one is specifically targeted for the serotypes that are important for the adult. So it's 21-valent, but I would just emphasize that 11 serotypes in the 21 valent for V116 is not shared by PCV20. And the reason is that we're focused on the adult disease, and we are targeting 85% of residual invasive pneumococcal disease. And I would \u2013 if I look at the vaccines that are in Phase 3, but also Phase 2 or Phase 1 with recent data, I don't know that anyone else has a vaccine that's targeting 85% of the residual invasive pneumococcal disease. So more is not better, one size does not fit all the right vaccine, the right patient at the right time. Thank you very much for that question. So, yes, we gave top line results. We are moving with speed to present those data to regulatory authorities throughout. But just to step back, I just want to remind, at least myself and every \u2013 and others that we were drawn to the sotatercept mechanism because it was a unique mechanism of action. It's the rebalance activin and BMP signaling. The other mechanisms of action could largely be viewed as vasodilatory, and we have a very strong program in trying to make the best [indiscernible] medicine. But the mechanism of action you would expect for sotatercept, you would expect it would potentially reprogram the cellular response and essentially be disease modifying. We are excited about the results. We know that there was a profound effect on six-minute walk. But as you emphasized, time to clinical worsening, these multi-components are all really important and they came in clinically meaningful and statistically significant. So, we are hopeful that we can potentially reshape the treatment of PAH. I would emphasize that we talk about HYPERION, venous and CADENCE. But VICTORIA, which is the follow-on program. And the reason why that is really important to me is given the results that I see, I very much want the individuals who were on the STELLAR trial have the opportunity to get into VICTORIA, which is an open-label trial, because the effects that we see that will be reported in a meeting likely in 2023 are ones where we must make sure that those individuals who were recruited to STELLAR have continued access to sotatercept. That's how important we think the results are. I will take a shot at both of those questions. I will just emphasize that there is a continuing move to early cancer throughout the field, but especially at Merck. We have talked about the approval that we have in the early stage, both for Lynparza and KEYTRUDA. And this recent Merck-Moderna collaboration is to extend that. It's essentially an IO-IO combination, initially in melanoma, but with the possibility to expand, deepen and extend throughout other tumor types in different stages. So, given that, the critical thing for patients, especially in the early stage is to be able to have really excellent access to our medicines, and there is a need for scientific innovation. That is why we are advancing the subcu program. And we are confident that, that will not only be important and successful, but it will be really critical as we move into early phase because the ability cannot be linked to an infusion center. So, we are confident in our strategy of moving into early phase, and it is linked. Each scientific innovation required to improve access. In relationship with the RAS program, I have said previously that the RAS program of all of those who are advancing will require a combination. And the ability to move those programs such that you can have a dose and an ability to combine with other medicines is important. We have early data with our RAF inhibitor and many of the attributes that we think are required for that. We are big that the cards are looking like they could positively reflect on our KRAS program. But we will share that data, both in monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, at an appropriate time when we present that at a Congress. Yes. So, let me just speak to, we look at both our both sotatercept, and I would just also emphasize our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase are the same sort of general sense, which is we are willing to drive it into PAH. But when you look at the mechanism of action, you ask yourself, is there other places that you can affect diseases, that aren't pulmonary arterial hypertension, but diseases where you have pulmonary hypertension, such as diastolic heart failure or, for example, in lung disease. Our expectation is that we want to explore whether sotatercept and its unique mechanism of rebalancing certain molecular pathways could also be applied to those patients who have diastolic heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. And given the impact that sotatercept has that we have seen already with PAH, that gives us a little bit more confidence that that mechanism may be applicable to those people with diastolic heart failure. Equivalent is as we moved our in-house soluble guanylate cyclase. In PAH, we are also evaluating whether that molecule could also be used in those patients with lung disease who have pulmonary hypertension. So, the results give us more confidence at the next step. Thank you very much for that question. So, I just want to emphasize that islatravir is one molecule in our suite of NRTTI molecule. And as you mentioned, we are very interested in the importance of this body of molecules and mechanism, both for the prep setting and for the treatment setting. And it has the possibility of really transforming the longer-acting space. Specifically to your question, we have a large range of clinical data as many... And so we have a plethora of clinical data. We are very confident that the 0.25 milligrams will be effective. We are confident that the effects on lymphocytes and CD4 T-cells will be comparable to any standard antiviral.

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2022 continues to be a year of excellent performance for our business. This quarter, we again achieved exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. These results reinforce our commitment to our science-led strategy, enabled by the flawless execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We are confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short-term, while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Total company revenues were $15 billion, an increase of 14%. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered strong growth of 10%. Underlying growth was 4 percentage points higher given the growing headwind from foreign exchange. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its momentum with growth of 19%, or 15% excluding LAGEVRIO, driven by strength across our key pillars. Our Animal Health business delivered a solid quarter as sales increased 4% in both our companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the third quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 26% to $5.4 billion driven by strong global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continued to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Intervening earlier in cancer progression provides the potential for better patient outcomes, which is why we remain excited by the impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with these early-stage cancers. Notably, there continues to be very strong demand in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer a testament to the profound effect KEYTRUDA is having for patients with this aggressive form of disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth continues to be driven by uptake in non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Recently approved earlier stage indications, including certain types of high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, are off to a strong start following launches in key European markets earlier this year. Lynparza maintained its leadership of the PARP inhibitor class. Our alliance revenue grew 23% driven by continued demand in certain patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer based on the OlympiA study. The outlook for Lynparza remains strong. And if approved, we are confident in the potential to reach patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 11%, a strong demand in the U.S. driven by continued uptake in advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer was partially offset by shipment timing in China. Lastly, WELIREG is performing consistent with our expectations, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need of patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. Our vaccines portfolio achieved excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 20% to $2.3 billion. Growth is being driven by strong underlying demand in ex-U.S. markets, particularly China. We recently received approval from China's National Medical Products Administration to expand the use of GARDASIL 9 to girls and women 9 to 45 years of age, which will further expand our opportunity in this important market. Growth in the U.S. was due to timing of CDC purchases, which will negatively impact fourth quarter sales. We are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth of GARDASIL given its proven effectiveness in preventing certain types of HPV-related cancers and other diseases. Global immunization levels remain low, which provides us a tremendous opportunity to benefit more patients. And we have invested aggressively in manufacturing capacity, which positions us well to supply the demand we expect to see now and over the long-term. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 22%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents and an increase in surgical procedures. As mentioned earlier, Animal Health sales increased 4%. Livestock sales increased due to poultry products and ruminant technology solutions. Companion animal sales growth was driven by the BRAVECTO line of products, partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, an increase of 0.2 percentage points, reflecting favorable product mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by the impact of lower margin LAGEVRIO and supply sales. Operating expenses were $6 billion, which includes $619 million of payments related to certain collaborations and licensing agreements. Excluding these payments, operating expenses grew 13%, driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $100 million, which reflects lower pension expense compared to last year. Our tax rate was 13.6%. Taken together, we earned $1.85 per share, which includes $0.22 of charges related to significant collaboration and licensing agreement. Excluding these charges, we had exceptional underlying growth. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.5 billion and $59 billion, including LAGEVRIO sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 20% to 21%. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of nearly 1% using mid-October rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of approximately 4%. Excluding foreign exchange and LAGEVRIO, we expect growth of approximately 16%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing and narrowing our operating expense projection to $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion, principally driven by a $250 million payment related to the recent exercise of our option to jointly develop a personalized cancer vaccine as part of our ongoing collaboration with Moderna. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We continue to assume other expense of approximately $500 million. We expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 14%. We assume 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased and narrowed our expected EPS range to $7.32 to $7.37, an increase of $0.05 at the midpoint. The operational momentum in our business would have led to an approximately $0.20 increase in our guidance. However, it is being partially offset by the option payments in Moderna and an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of nearly 1% using mid-October rates. Our guidance reflects confidence in the underlying strength of our business. We continue to demonstrate strong momentum and expect durable underlying demand across our key pillars, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. As you consider your model, there are a few items to keep in mind. While we actively manage foreign exchange through our revenue hedging program, it continues to be a headwind to growth, particularly across products with a larger portion of international revenues, such as in our Animal Health business. The hedging program mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. And to the extent we continue to see foreign exchange headwinds recorded at the product level, we will see a benefit in other revenues. In addition, other revenue includes the supply sales to Organon. As you saw in our results, PNEUMOVAX23 is experiencing pressure, particularly in the U.S. as the market continues to shift towards newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. We remain committed to our capital allocation priorities. We will continue to prioritize investments in our pipeline and business to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We have made significant progress across our pipeline which Dean will speak to that has the potential to drive sustainable revenue growth. We are augmenting our pipeline by steering the best external science through value-enhancing business development, which we will invest in to realize the promise of these products. We continue to consider the full breadth of the business development landscape. We have ample balance sheet capacity and we will act only when science and value align. Should meaningful business development not materialize and depending on the pipeline of potential transactions, we will opportunistically buyback shares. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain confident in the continued growth of our business. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remains strong and we continue to demonstrate the operational momentum and commercial execution that will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. So Chris, our capital allocation priorities are unchanged. We seek to provide a competitive return to our shareholders through both the dividend that we pay and we expect will grow, as well as through share repurchases, while we balance the need to invest in our business in driving growth, as well as in our business development strategies, as Robert just outlined. Given where we are, with our focus on business development, our desire to not create excess cash on the balance sheet, we will look opportunistically at share buybacks based on our assessment of that BD pipeline. This is Caroline. I'll take a shot at answering your question. So GARDASIL continues to be a very strong growth driver for our company and will be long into the future given to date only 9% of the world's eligible population are vaccinated. In terms of the quarter results, we saw growth in the U. S., which was largely driven by the CDC timing. In the third quarter of 2021, there was an approximate $125 million buy-in by the CDC. In the third quarter of \u201822, there was an approximate buy-in of $250 million. So year-over-year, that contributed to growth to the tune of approximately $120 million plus. We do expect the majority of that buy-in by the CDC in the third quarter to come out during the fourth quarter. As we look at our opportunity to satisfy the global demand and protect as many lives as we can going forward, we will be supported by the increased supply and capacity that we have coming online commencing 2023. And we expect that, that additional supply will come online over the course of \u201823, \u201824 and \u201825. And therefore, we remain very confident in our ability to protect more lives, to drive growth long into the future, including doubling the revenue of GARDASIL in the year 2030 compared to where we were in 2021."

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Our strong performance this quarter reflects sustained momentum across our key growth drivers and steady progress in our pipeline. We are well positioned to successfully close out the year and we look forward to building on this momentum in 2023 and beyond. We are delivering across our strategic priorities and executing well scientifically, operationally and commercially. As a result, our pipeline is advancing, our business is healthy, our growth pillars are intact, and our financial performance is strong. We remain keenly focused on sustaining the success by driving continued growth and delivering long-term value to patients and shareholders. With that, let's turn first to our results. We are pleased to report exceptional revenue and underlying earnings growth again this quarter. We continue to see robust demand for our innovative human and animal health portfolios, including for products such as KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, BRIDION and BRAVECTO. Our updated guidance reflects our expectation of truly standout full year growth. Moving to our research organization, we have made considerable progress across multiple therapeutic areas. In cardiovascular, the top line results of the STELLAR Phase 3 trial evaluating sotatercept in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension achieved successful outcomes across both the primary and almost every secondary endpoint, suggesting the potential to transform the treatment of patients suffering from this devastating disease. I am proud of the way our research organization has moved swiftly following last year's acquisition of Acceleron to advance sotatercept's development. We continue to advance other programs across our broad cardiovascular pipeline, including our Factor XI inhibitor, which recently received an FDA Fast Track designation for patients with end-stage renal disease. Turning to oncology, we presented encouraging results at ESMO across our broad portfolio and promising pipeline. Long-term survival data reinforces the durable benefits of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for certain patients. We remain enthusiastic about the potential of KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of cancer as well as in combination with other agents. In vaccines, we launched VAXNEUVANCE in the pediatric setting and are progressing our Phase 3 trial of V116 in adults, an important component of our population-specific approach to invasive pneumococcal disease and part of our broader efforts to provide strong protection to both infants and adults. And finally, in HIV, we are pleased that there is a path forward for islatravir clinical trials in the treatment setting. We remain committed to helping address unmet needs in both treatment and prevention. Moving to our efforts around sustainability, we continue to execute on our priorities, further demonstrating our longstanding commitment to delivering value to society, which in turn, creates value for shareholders. In August, we published our annual ESG progress report, which provides a comprehensive review of our sustainability strategy, initiatives underway and progress against our goals. Consistent with our mission, we are focused on access to health, ensuring that our inventions reach as many patients as possible. To enable access, we are committed to responsibly discovering and manufacturing our medicines and vaccines, to bringing our best ideas forward through the empowerment of our talented and diverse employees and to always operating with strong ethics and values. Some of our initiatives include a commitment to providing 91.5 million doses of HPV vaccines in Gavi-supported countries, advancing our goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 and supporting projects and partnerships in our priority areas through the issuance of an inaugural $1 billion sustainability bond. Our approach to sustainability helps propel and enable our business strategy in ways that align with our operating priorities. This makes us a better company and global citizen, creating value for society and for shareholders. Yesterday evening, we also announced that Ken Fraser will be retiring from his role as Chairman of Merck's Board of Directors at the end of November. I know I speak on behalf of the entire company and our Board in expressing our deepest appreciation for Ken, his principal leadership, respect for science, passion for engaging with employees everywhere, commitment to patients and health equity and contributions to communities around the world. Speaking personally, I am deeply grateful for the inspiration, mentorship and support Ken has provided to me. Moving ahead, I look forward to working with the Board in my new role as Chairman as we continue to build on Ken's legacy and drive core to our purpose of using leading-edge science to save and improve lives globally. I am confident that we have the fundamental building blocks in place to achieve sustainable growth and value creation. This is exemplified by our talented team of scientists and our colleagues all around the world who are dedicated to discovering, developing and delivering life-changing medicines and vaccines. I am very confident in the short and long-term outlook of our company and I look forward to continuing to share progress as we move into the future. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Yes. Great, Chris. Thanks for the question, and I'll ask Caroline to comment specifically on the share repurchase side of the question. But just for the BD landscape, we continue to, frankly, see a portfolio of opportunities we are interested in and are continuing to look at. So as we sit here today, our focus, our urgency on business development has not changed. We do see a list of potential places to play. Obviously, we got to bring them through to fruition which we're working to do. That is our priority because we continue to believe the best thing we can do for long-term value creation is to invest in the sustainability of our business, which is investing in the pipeline of the future in both what we do internally and through BD. So that's our priority. And I do see opportunities. But obviously, we remain committed also to not hold cash. So with that, maybe I'll let Caroline comment specifically on the share repurchase. Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Leo. Thank you, Daina. Next question please, Leo. Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously, it's been a fast six months \u2013 or 16 months in the role. But I would say what I am most proud of, several things. One, the way the organization has come together as one team and really brought more focus in the business. Obviously, the spin-off of Organon, I think was very successful, has given us more simple structures, more focus that I feel very good about. Our progress on business development, obviously, the fact that we moved so quickly with Acceleron and then you heard what are just really exceptional results coming out of the STELLAR study, feel very proud about. But I would say also just overall the way our team has continued to just execute really flawlessly, scientifically, operational, commercially, I couldn't be prouder of what everyone is doing. We have come together and we are really delivering for all of those things I would say I am very proud about. On the pipeline itself, I actually think we are making a lot of progress. The fact that a year ago won't even give us credit for having a cardiovascular pipeline. And today, we talk about the fact that by the \u201824 to \u201828 timeframe, we could be having as many as eight new approvals driving revenue that could be in excess of $10 billion by the mid-2030s across the whole suite of assets, some developed internally and obviously some brought into business development, like what we did with Acceleron. So, I feel very good about that. The progress we are making in vaccines, what we are seeing. I think VAXNEUVANCE is underappreciated. There is a notion that Dean laid out of really having a bespoke approach where we were able to cover more of the serotypes that cause disease, whether it be in infants, and then selectively and differently, those in adults. We think that's a real game changer. Our growing pipeline in neuroscience and immunology, I could go on and on, and the strength that we are continuing to have in adding to our oncology pipeline. So, do I think we have everything we need, no. But do I think we have made great progress in a year, I actually think we have, and it gives me confidence that we are going to continue to drive progress. The fact that we did three important business development deals this quarter alone, spanning mRNA technologies, into circular RNA technologies, personalized cancer vaccines and then more traditional oncology agents with a really novel mechanism, those all are adding to the future promise we have in this company. So, I actually feel very good about that. More to do, but confidence in what we have done so far. Yes. Maybe I can start that and Caroline or Dean can add on. If you look \u2013 if you go back in history, Merck has actually had a strong history and legacy in cardiovascular. And a lot of the \u2013 if you will, the muscle memory still exists in our organization. So, I am very confident that we have what it takes. But more importantly, we are already out there right now in PAH. We have Adempas. We have Verquvo. So, we have people calling on these doctors. Recall what drove us to think about Acceleron was what we saw in our pipeline, but also what we saw commercially through that experience. So, we do have the capabilities. And also the other thing I would point out is this is a little different than the way we used to think about the world. This is \u2013 in many cases, a lot of these drugs are still specialty drugs. They are not necessarily the true traditional primary care drugs of what we have seen in the past. And I think we are very well positioned. So, I have no worries about our confidence and ability to deliver this commercially. We have done it in the past, and we will do it again. And Umer, to the specific question of the conversion, it's probably too early to get into the specifics of that. But I would say, generally, we do see this as bringing meaningful patient benefit. If you think about quality of life, as you move especially in the earlier stages of cancer, to be able to deliver the drug subcutaneously, we think is both innovative and will bring real value to the patients. So, that is part of the strategy as we look at the totality of how is it that we continue to deliver for patients as we extend our franchise. So, that's something we are looking at, but more details as we get further down the road. Sure. Chris, thanks for the question. As we have said in the past, we are always looking at the portfolio. We were always asking what is the best structure to develop and generate long-term value for our business and for our shareholders. And with that view, we continue to believe that the animal health business is a key growth driver for us. It brings a lot of synergies, frankly, in both directions. Obviously, they are benefiting from their ability to access the science on the human health side. We are benefiting from the value they bring and, in some cases, frankly, on the vaccine side, some of the manufacturing technologies are actually being brought over into the human health side. So, we do see synergies in these two businesses. We continue to believe that our ability to invest fully to optimize the opportunity in animal health is there. I think we have demonstrated that to the capital we have deployed and that capital is paying off. And I don't believe that business would have the capital it's had to grow if it wasn't part of Merck. So, it's benefiting from what we can bring to them. We are benefiting from what it brings to us and as of now we continue to see it as a strategic asset. So, no plans to look at spinning it."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Merck & Company Q2 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Peter Dannenbaum, VP Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Welcome to Merck's Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Lee, President of Merck Research Labs.  Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You'll see that we have items in our GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.

The presentation today earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.  With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm proud to report that the business continues to perform extremely well. We remain firmly guided by our strategic priorities to bid long-term growth and deliver value to patients and shareholders. We're executing on the opportunities in front of us today, while simultaneously making the necessary investments to sustain our success long into the future. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we achieved robust top and bottom line growth and made additional important clinical advancements in our pipeline.  Turning first to our results. We again achieved exceptional performance this quarter led by strong growth of key products, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION. Our results rated by revenue from LAGEVRIO, which is helping to in fighting COVID-19. We're confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio as we continue to see momentum in our business, which we are pleased to reflect our updated guidance.  Moving to research organization. We continue to advance our pipeline most significantly across our suite of pneumococcal vaccines. VAXNEUVANCE received an expanded approval from the FDA for pediatric case, providing an important option for sort in prevention invasive in pneumococcal disease.  We also presented by the results from clinical studies of V116, our vaccine, designed specifically to address remaining of in adults, and we've initiated difficult phase III studies. These milestones reinforce the confidence we have in our population specific approach to address the needs of children and adults.  We've also taken additional taste understand the significant opportunities we see in the pipeline. In June, we hosted an investor event at ASCO. We highlighted the depth and breadth of our oncology program. At the event, we reiterated our ambition to become the leading oncology company by 2025 and our goal of sustaining this success well into the next decade.  As I reflect on my first year as CEO, I'm pretty pleased by the significant progress we've made in advancing worth position as a global pharmaceutical leader and the interim momentum starting across our business. The unwavering focused indication of our employees worldwide is driving strong execution on significant opportunity in front of us. We're demonstrating impressive resilience across all aspects of our business in a every challenging global environment. We're achieving market levels of production in our manufacturing operations, delivering exceptionally strong revenue growth, making meaningful bands in our pipeline and taking important steps to expand our outlook. Our strategy is working and our future is bright. I was very confident a year ago, and I'm even more confident today that we are well positioned to achieve our near and long-term goals, anchored by our commitment to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients and value to all of our stakeholders, including shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are maintaining this year's strong momentum with another quarter of exceptional performance in both revenue and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our personal science as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is being enabled by the excellent execution of our dedicated products across the globe and continue to deliver value for patients, customers and shareholders.  company revenues were $14.6 billion, an increase of 28%. LAGEVRIO contributing $1.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered very strong growth of 18%.  The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum with growth of 33% or 21%, excluding LAGEVRIO driven by our key pillars. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance, with sales increasing 5% driven by growth across both our livestock and companion animal products.  Now turning to the second performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 30% to $5.3 billion, driven by the vast global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications and to reflect the preponed impact it is having more patients across the globe.  In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate momentum in metastatic indication and is experiencing strong growth from recent launches in early stage transfers, including triple-native breast renal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is now approved in 6 indications in earlier stage cancers.  We've seen strong utilization and are confident in its continued success as physician and patient experience growth. We have seen a particularly strong uptake in neoadjuvant adjuvant high-mileage triple-net breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522, offering a distinct treatment patients in an area of significant unmet need.  In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintained the leadership position in non-small lung cancer capturing 8 out of 10 patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA was driven by continued uptake in non-small cell lung cancer and the ongoing in neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Initial indicators also point to encouraging trends in the United States indications, including breast cancer and renal carcinoma in key European markets.  The Lynparza remains a market-leading part inhibitor. Our revenue grew 17%, driven by uptaking patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer following FDA approval by [indiscernible]. We look forward to potentially expanding leadership by reaching the digital prospect cancer patients based on study.  Lenvima revenue grew 33% due to strong demand following the launch of in advanced renal cell carcinoma and PMOT775 in metastatic endometrial cancer. New patient target tumors remain strong.  Lastly, we continue to be encouraged by \u2022 WELIREG which is tracking in line with expectations. Portfolio again delivered excellent growth rate by GARDASIL, which increased 40% to $1.7 billion. Outside the U.S., GARDASIL significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand, particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S. that decrease primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns, although we continue to be impact from [indiscernible].  We continue to invest behind activation campaign to ensure that parents recognize the importance of routine division to their children, particularly during the [indiscernible]. We remain confident in the growth trajectory of GARDASIL given the proven ability to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males.  In our hospital acute care portfolio, sales was 15%, driven by greater share among and the increase in surgical procedures. Our animal health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 5%, grew 6%, driven by higher demand in and poultry. Companion animal sales increased 3% due to global demand for line of product.  I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.7%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points. The decrease was due to the impact of [indiscernible], higher inventory baseline increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix across the remainder of the portfolio as foreign exchange.  Operating expenses decreased 19% to $5.2 billion, reflecting charges primarily related to last year's $1.7 million acquisition of which is reflected in our second quarter 2021 R&D expense. Operating expenses excluding these charges incline our plan, driven by investments in our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $200 million, reflecting higher-than-expected pension settlement effect.  Our tax rate was 13.8%. Taken together, we add $1.87 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business enables us to rate and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $57.5 billion and $58.5 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 18% to 20% or 13% to 14%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange.  The projected impact from burn exchange includes an incremental headwind of more than 1% using this July rent resulting a net impact of approximately 3%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing our operating expense projection to $20.5 billion to $21.5 billion, primarily driven by the $219 million upfront payment from the recently announced collaboration with Orion Corporation.  As an ongoing practice, our finance does not include significant potential when we development transaction. We increased our expectations of other expense to approximately $100 million, reflecting higher-than-anticipated pension settlement expense. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5%. We assumed 2.54 billion shares outstanding.  Taken together, we have managed our expected EPS range to $725 to $7.35. The operational front in our business would have led with approximately 20% increase in our guidance. This strength is being offset by the upfront entry to Orion, by pension settlement expense and an incremental headwind on foreign exchange more than 1% due in [indiscernible].  Overall, that guidance reflects our confidence that the strong underlying momentum of our business will continue into the second half of the year. As you consider your models, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the pandemic as a tailing to growth in the first half of the expect the benefits to yearly reset over the remainder of the year.  Also, we actively managed the impact of foreign exchange through our revenue saving program. To the extent we see further negative impact from foreign exchange, we will see additional benefits from our hedging in other revenues as we did in this quarter.  Other revenue also includes supply to Organon and the Johnson & Johnson for its COVID-19 vaccine as well as we see related to our out licensing arrangements. In total, we expect other revenue to be higher in the second half versus first half of 2022.  With respect to our products, for [indiscernible], we continue to expect a negative impact to U.S. sales, given the shift towards new adults pneumococcal vaccine. On Animal Health, we're seeing normalized industry growth rate as we adverse favorable trends in ending resulting from pandemic and experience foreign exchange headwinds. However, given our broad innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to continue to drive the market growth in 2022 and beyond.  Finally, we continue to expect to look at full year sales of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, with second half sales weighted to the fourth quarter.  Adaptation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to clarify investments in our pipeline and business to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities in [indiscernible]. We continue to pursue compelling with strategic business development to augment our internal pipeline. Our recent collaboration with Orion is another example of our execution of this strategy.  We remain committed to our dividend, which we expect to increase through the time. Finally, to the extent we have extra cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases.  To conclude, at the end of the second half of the year, we remain very confident in business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our excellent execution will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the first quarter call. We continue to execute on our pipeline strategy. We are advancing the latest signs to generate medicines and vaccines that provide clear benefit for patients.  Today, I will highlight recent progress in our vaccine pipeline and provide an update on our oncology program as well as LAGEVRIO.  As Rob noted, we have made significant progress across our pneumococcal portfolio. Building upon the approval in the adult indication we received a year ago. Last month, we received FDA approval for our 15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, VAXNEUVANCE an important new option to help protect pediatric populations against invasive pneumococcal disease.  VAXNEUVANCE is the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine approved for pediatric populations in almost a decade. VAXNEUVANCE provides comparable immunogenicity for 12 shared compared to the currently available 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, improved immunogenicity for serotype 3 and expanded coverage for serotype 22F and 33F.  Serotype 3, 22F and 33F are key invasive disease using serotypes known to be responsible for more than a quarter of all invasive pneumococcal disease in children.  Following FDA approval, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted unanimously to endorse VAXNEUVANCE as an option for children under 19 years of age.  Additionally, the ACID unanimously voted to include VAXNEUVANCE and the vaccines for children program. We await publication of the final CEC recommendation in the morbidity and mortality weekly report.  Also in June, at the International Symposium on pneumococi and pneumococcal diseases in Toronto, we presented positive results from our Phase I/II study evaluating V116, our investigation 21 delink pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine naive adult. V 116 is designed to significantly expand coverage compared to currently licensed pneumococcal vaccines by targeting serotypes that account for 85% of all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults aged 65 and older in the United States as of 2019.  As a strong indicator of our progress, we recently enrolled the first patient into the STRIDE 3 trial evaluating V116 in vaccine-naive adult, the first of 4 current Phase III trial.  We have taken a thoughtful and tailored approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidate designed to forward production by targeting strains posing the greatest risk to specific populations.  I look forward to providing additional updates on the progress of our pneumococcal program for VAXNEUVANCE, V116 and V117, our investigational candidate, specifically targeting pediatric disease.  Turning to oncology. We continue to build on the momentum in earlier-stage cancers. We announced that the FDA has accepted our application of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer following surgical reduction based on the results of the ongoing KEYNOTE-091 trial. The FDA has set a prescription drug user date of January 29, 2023. However, further data may be provided during the review process that may delay the state.  At the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, we provided expanded analysis and presented data on new endpoints in key subgroups 4, KEYNOTE-716 and for the adjuvant treatment in Stage IIb and IC melanoma, KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and KEYNOTE-564 in adjuvant RCC.  We are also delivering on our regulatory strategy outside the United States. Notable actions include 4 approvals for KEYTRUDA from the European Commission based on KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIb or 2C melanoma; KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 in MSI high and/or mismatched for tumors in 5 different cancer types; and KEYNOTE-826 and certain types of persistent recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.  In addition, we received a positive EU CHMP opinion for adjuvant treatment with LYNPARZA for patients with serotypes of high-risk early-stage breast cancer based on the Phase II OLYMPIA trial.  And finally, we are encouraged by the positive readout of KEYNOTE-869 or EV-103 and first-line urothelial cancer, which is in collaboration with SGI.  Next, I want to discuss our ongoing efforts to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer impacts millions of men and those with advanced disease at low rates of 5-year survival. We continue to generate insight about prostate cancer from our ongoing work, and we remain focused on improving patient outcomes.  Business development and licensing remains a key element of our strategy to build and maintain a strong and diverse pipeline.  Earlier this month, we announced a global development and commercial relation agreement with Orion for investigational oral steroid synthesis inhibitor, ODM-208, which is currently in Phase II development for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  ODM-208 targets cytochrome P450 1181, a novel approach that is complementary to our broad-based prostate cancer program, which includes the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091, KEYTRUDA with antiandrogen therapy based on KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-991 and LYNPARZA with anti-androgen therapy based on the PROPEL trial.  Next, to COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO the pandemic persists and SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. There are solid emerging evidence for the threat of resistance to antibody therapies from Omicron variants, notably B4 and B5. The rate of transmission and increased hospitalization with these variants reinforces the need for multiple effective antiviral treatment options, especially for those most vulnerable. For high-risk patients, evidence continues to show that prompt therapeutic intervention improved outcome.  Importantly, a large proportion of high-risk individuals, including older adults, are likely receiving additional medications for chronic conditions. LAGEVRIO's low propensity for drug-drug interaction avoids the need to adjust existing dosing regimen and monitor liver and kidney functions during treatment, which can facilitate timely intervention for appropriate patients.  Recently, data reported from Denmark, Hong Kong and Poland have provided support for the utility of LAGEVRIO in real-world settings. We plan to share more data as they become available.  To conclude, I am proud of the advancements across our pipeline to date and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific primaries in the future.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Alan, we're ready for the Q&A session. If you could please assemble the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Maybe a 2-part one here. Just wondering if there's a pathway to extend the IP on KEYTRUDA via either subcu formulator maybe some other type of formulation patents? And then is there anything from a technical perspective that would prohibit a co-formulation of KEYTRUDA with an antibody drug conjugate?\nDean Li: I guess I will take this. This is Dean. In relationship to different routes of administration, I think you've highlighted that, especially as we go into early stages of cancer, there will be a demand, demand by the patients and the providers to really come up with other formulations besides intravenous formulations where you have to go to an infusion center. So subcutaneous pembrolizumab could be very important to serve that need. And the innovation required for subcutaneous KEYTRUDA is viewed through the past history, and I would imagine the current situation is novel, useful and nonobvious. So I think there is a path to think about how to think about that innovation.  In relationship to co-formulations. In general, co-formulations work well with, for example, when we do IO-IO with PD-1 that CTLA-4 TIGIT or LAG-3. The issue with chemo-based or antibody drug conjugate basis, I would be a little bit hesitant to do that. Oftentimes, they're based on weight base, and so I think that coal formulations of, for example, any IO agent with any chemotherapy or antibody drug conjugates could be challenging to take that clinically.\nOperator: That will be from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: So with the widespread news reports of a potential deal with Senators management and Schumer, can you provide us with your thoughts on kind of the structure for Medicare to directly negotiate with manufacturers for drug reimbursement and the potential impact on R&D going forward?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Evan, thanks for the question. This is Rob. As you said, there is reports out really just came out yesterday of a potential deal with the Senator and in that is elements of what have been part of the build back better plan related to drug pricing. So as we look at that, I think it's important to understand, first and foremost, we do have significant concern on one very important element of the provision, which is the fact that there is what we see as price setting, it's termed in negotiation. But in effect, what it is, it is price setting on drugs after a period of time. And we do believe that will be highly chilling on future innovation because, especially if you think about an area like oncology, oncology is an area that the development of the drug continues long after the first approval. If you take KEYTRUDA, the launch in 2014 between 2014 and 2022, we had something like 30-plus indications approved. We expect to have well more than double that between 2022 and 2028. And our concern is that if you start to have the threat of discounts, mandatory discounts that could cause companies to question that innovation because you'll have to question whether or not you're going to see the return.  So we see a higher chilling effect of that, and it's something that we will continue both at and as the industry to make sure that we communicate our concerns there.  And the only other thing I might add is, as you think about how we think about this to our business going forward. It's important to understand that as we look at this, while obviously, it will have an impact, importantly, as we've planned for the future of the business, we have always assumed some form of price pressure coming, including in the United States. I think we've communicated that in the past. So as we look at this, and you think of a relative to the guidance we've given in the past of expectations for strong growth through our long-range period. That continues and includes the assumptions around this. So while I think we will manage it, I do worry about what it will do to innovation in the industry.\nOperator: Will come from Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. Firstly, you've announced a couple of licensing from China of ATC. I think one of them is in late-stage development. It's obviously widely reported that you're in talks with Seagen, which has Phase III data from another ADC molecule, which would compete with in HER2. In general, I'm just interested, Dr. Pastor seems to have closed the doors on seeking approval in the U.S. using data from Chinese trials. But operationally, how fast does it enable you to go, knowing that you have efficacy and safety signals in a Chinese population in expediting the move into Phase III i.e., is there an advantage here that you could enable you to catch up with the market leaders and the respective categories? And then second question on islatravir, perhaps you care to update us how your discussions with Gilead in terms of and the FDA in terms of resuming trials. Is this drug alive as a prophylactic, in PREP as a treatment, both or neither?\nDean Li: So this is Dean. Thank you very much for those questions. tackle your first question related to our recently announced partnership with Kelyn. I should just emphasize this was recently announced, but we've had a productive, a really productive partnership for the past 2 years. And most recently, they have announced progress in 2 programs. One that they've declared, which relates to Trop-2 ADCs, and they're advancing it in China in relationship with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  In relationship to what you've said in moving those molecules for example, in the United States, I think the FDA and we support this. The FDA has been very clear of the importance of doing those trials, not in a single geography such as China, but to have global studies that include the United States. And so the ability for our partners to give us a signal in a human population is really important and allows us to navigate how to think about it at a global level. And so we are hopeful that this partnership will allow us to accelerate the benefits of this stroke to ADC to as many patients as possible.  To your second question in relationship with [indiscernible]. As you've noticed, is our nRTTI. It's extremely potent that has a resident time and tissue has a high barrier to resistance. And we had 2 Phase III studies that have excellent results. Nevertheless, we also had reduction in lymphocytes across a number of our programs, most of it a symptomatic, but in a combo trial with MK-8507, there was clinically meaningful reduction that's still dependent. We have spent the last 6 months understanding that. We understand it far better. We believe that there is a potential path forward to maintain and to have that efficacy and also reduce the effects on the blood cells. We are in active discussions with the FDA. So I don't want to get ahead of myself there, and we clearly have active discussions with our partners.  In relationship to the question of treatment and PREP, I just want to make sure that everyone recognizes we have always thought that this class of molecules NRTTI and islatravir is just 1 compound within this class could be broadly used in treatment and in PrEP, and we are interested in applying both of those -- advancing both of those possibilities, but we are in the midst of discussions with the FDA that I think we should provide them the data that they will need.\nOperator: That will be Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So I wanted to ask you about the checkpoint inhibitor strategy. What are your thoughts on the changing treatment paradigm for checkpoint inhibitors in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant cancer setting. How do you think about adoption and uptake in this setting? And do you think doctors are convinced of the opportunity yet? Or is there more work to be done?\nDean Li: Well, let me answer it from a scientific standpoint. Maybe we'll have Carolina or Rob answer it from a market standpoint. I do think it's really important to just highlight, at least for me, PD-1s have been incredible and metastatic through a broad range of tumor types. And we keep growing for earlier stages. And it's not apriority that a medicine that works in the metastatic patient who has a very different benefit/risk ratio will be truly effective in the early stage. And it's been impressive. We have 6 approvals, whether it be in breast, in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And we have a positive trial in relationship to lung, and we have many others advancing.  So I think that part of it is I think the uptake has been good, but the most important thing is that scientifically, the data has been very good. And I think the field will adopt it. I think one of the things that will be critical as the field adopts it is that oftentimes, you're now talking not necessarily about a medical oncologist. So there will be work for us to do, but I think the results speak for themselves. And I would recommend that people look at that data, and I think that it's an important advancement in the field. But in terms of the uptake, Caroline, do you want to take with that?\nCaroline Litchfield: Yes. Thank you, Dean. So Louis, we are really excited about the opportunities that we have moving into earlier stages of cancer. Clearly, if we can impact patients then, the possibilities of better outcomes are greater. We have seen in our early-stage cancers impressive performance. We're seeing very strong performance in triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And if I just touch on triple-negative breast cancer, we had the KEYNOTE-522 approval here in the United States July of last year.  During the second part of last year, we saw tremendous uptake in the first segment of treatment, the neoadjuvant treatment ahead of people then getting their surgery some 24 weeks later. What we're now seeing is not only patients coming on to KEYTRUDA for neoadjuvent triple-negative breast cancer. We're also seeing them return to treatment following their surgery. So we're very optimistic about the opportunities we have in the adjuvant setting and the impact that we can have on patients.\nOperator: We will go to Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I have 2 here, if I may. First, Rob, I know you've mentioned M&A is critical to further diversification of the business away from KEYTRUDA. And you could explore M&A in basically in a non-oncology bucket like Acceleron or in oncology. And I guess that brings me to my first question, which is in oncology, it's a very high-quality problem of KEYTRUDA being this foundational treatment across so many different tumors. And how do you approach that given the increased FTC focus on looking at a lot of deals based on market shares on individual markets, considering KEYTRUDA basically has a market share in solving different tumors. And how do you think about oncology deals in general given KEYTRUDA's roll in. I'm sure you guys have thought about that at length to the extent you're thinking about any capital deployment.  Separately, Rob, also, you mentioned drug pricing and mandatory discounts. And I'm sure you've run exercise internally attempting to quantify how much in discounts. And what I'm getting at is for key franchises like KEYTRUDA, considering the price of U.S. and ex-U.S. is fairly comparable, wouldn't there be not much mandatory discount at all? I just want to make sure I'm not off track there despite KEYTRUDA being a top part B drug.\nRobert Davis: Yes. I appreciate the questions. And on your first question around the M&A space and what we see in the oncology field. No, I would just start by saying, obviously, we are very proud of the success we've had with KEYTRUDA and the fact that it's been able to impact so many people's lives, as you say, across so many different tumor types. But I think it's important to understand that oncology continues to be an incredibly competitive field, and importantly, it's not monolithic. You have to look tumor by tumor and even modalities, whether it's I/O or targeted therapy. So there are multiple different approaches, multiple modalities and it is a very tumor specific. And as you know, we have to develop these drugs indication by indication of investing in the science to bring each of those forward.  And in that regard, as we look at it and as we thought about it, we continue to believe that while the environment is more complex. And obviously, we'll have to be very thoughtful on how we navigate it I believe, we believe, as long as we are doing deals that are science-driven, where we accelerate innovation, and we can show that we can expand access to patients around the world and in the United States to medicines that there are still deals to be done and that there's a path to move forward.  And so that's very much where we're focusing and why we continue to believe the opportunity exists to continue to expand treatments for patients and and for the benefit of, frankly, all stakeholders, including shareholders.  On your second question, and I think it depends on the way you look at it. as far as the upcoming regulation. Obviously, if you look across what is being proposed, if you're speaking specifically to the potential for mandatory price discounting at some point. Obviously, the language has to be finalized. But if you look at where it is today, the way it is being proposed is that for a period of time after a drug is approved during its period of exclusivity for -- right now, it's roughly 7 years for negotiation for slow molecules, 11 years for large molecules, you were able to operate with no discount.  At that period of time, there would be a discussion and opportunity for HSS to select the drug depending on their determination of which drugs to look at. Right now is the language as discussed, we'll pick 10 drugs a year and up to the HSS to determine which drug they pick. But importantly, then the negotiation itself once it is done and the discount is determined and that discount is outlined in the legislation would take effect at year 9 for a small molecule year for a large molecule. So as you think of something like KEYTRUDA, we're really talking about periods of time that are out around the time of loss of exclusivity in 2028. And obviously, there's other language that's being proposed potentially to allow for an exception if there are biosimilar products in development coming that then you would not be subject to it.  So the reality of it is it's unclear what the impact will be in the short term, we don't see impacts from that specific part of the regulation. It will be longer term as it relates to our important drugs, KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. And then obviously, we have to see how the final language comes out. But in the language or then the specified discounts that will be set. So it's not reference price in the way they're setting it up right now. And then obviously, beyond that, there is what they have around the Part B reforms, which actually we support because we believe that will reduce the out-of-pocket costs for patients at the counter, but our -- the reason we continue to oppose the overall legislation is a strong belief that, that focus on mandatory discounts after a period of time as chilling innovation. So I'm not sure I got your question, but I think that's what you were trying to get at.\nOperator: That will be from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoffrey Meacham: I just had a couple of quick ones. Dean, I wanted to ask you on KEYNOTE-412, the recent -- it didn't hit significance. Did CRT add complexity to the study in terms of your assumptions? And more broadly, if you look at other indications, does a CRT backbone present any particular challenges when you look at other keynote studies? And then on COVID, the recent infection trends just over the course of this year or the emergence of any new variants, does that change the strategy about the future investments you guys are going to make in LAGEVRIO or even other orals?\nDean Li: All right. I'll take both of them, I'll take the Keynote-412. So you're speaking about the -- us trying to go into early stage at a neck and you're speaking about the -412, as you've emphasized, there was improvement in event-free survival who patients who received the KEYTRUDA regimen compared to the placebo plus DRT.  However, these results did not meet statistical significance based on our statistical plan. So there's clearly a positive signal, but it did cross the line. In relationship to -- how to think about CRT or radiation and other indications in this. I would not say that it gives you extra complication. We'll have to see in these other trials when -- not just us but other people in relationship to the combination there.  But I would just emphasize that it was an improvement in EFS. So I wouldn't say that it was a complicating issue for us. We just did need statistical significance.  I do want to make sure that everyone recognizes that this isn't our only foray into a neck early stage. We have a KEYNOTE-689 that's also in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment as well. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can break in into early stage at a neck despite the fact that KEYNOTE-412, it had a positive EFS did not lead to statistical significance.  In relationship to the pandemic, I need to be a little bit careful because everyone who's predicted what will happen with the pandemic have all had one common thread. They've all been not so right. And so we'll have to see what happens with the pandemic. We'll have to see what the emergence of resistance is, but I would emphasize the importance of having multiple mechanisms of action is clear. I would just emphasize that it is quite surprising to me how quickly this virus can mutate around those therapies, for example, focused on this like protein. That's actually it takes many amino-acid changes to do it. And it might take very few amino acids changes to get resistance to, for example, other therapies, but we'll have to see what it is. But I just want to also emphasize that, especially outside of the United States, there's been a great use of it and uptake, and it's really based on the fact that if you have a patient population where you believe that they're extremely vulnerable and you can give this drug and you're most interested in reducing mortality, which this drug has an impressive impact on mortality and you want speed such that you can really see the patient and who may be on multiple medicines, have other complicating medical issues and feel free that you can give this, if those are the important sort of attributes then we have found that LAGEVRIO does quite well and the real-world evidence throughout the world has begun to substantiate.\nCaroline Litchfield: And Jeff, this is Caroline. The only thing I would add in terms of further investments is our belief in the molecule as being a molecule that could be impactful not only against COVID-19, but also pan coronavirus, RSA and flu. And as a result, we will invest in appropriate programs to try and prove that out.\nOperator: That will be from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho.\nMara Goldstein: Firstly, I just wanted to understand the statement about KEYTRUDA supplemental PDUFA for neoadjuvant and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer? And have you been asked for additional data? Or are you planning for a major amendment?  And then secondarily, I just wanted to also get some clarity on the comment about excess cash for share repurchase. And at what threshold should we be thinking about that if you're also committed to raising dividend?\nDean Li: Yes. So I'll -- this is Dean. I'll take the KEYNOTE-091 that's the lung adjuvant. And just to remind everyone, that had dual primary endpoints. And the reason I want to emphasize that is a dual primary means that if you hit on one of the endpoints, you have a positive trial. And this is a distinction from those trials that are co-primary where you have to hit on both. So this is a positive trial because in the disease-free survival, it's positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1.  The dual primary of DFS in terms of those with a TPS greater than 50%, there is a positive trend, but it's not significant. And the OS has got a trend as we move forward. I would imagine, as data matures people may want to see those data, and I just want to emphasize that in relationship to early-stage lung cancer, we have other trials as well, which is KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-867 and KeyLink 012.  So I could imagine that as people deliberate on this, they will be interested in understanding how the data is maturing. These are event-driven and they're part of our FDA discussions and the PDUFA date, as you said, is January 29, 2023. But we could see a situation. There's nothing formally that's been asked of us, but we could see a situation where evolving data is asked for.\nCaroline Litchfield: And Mara, in response to your question on our utilization of excess cash, the capital allocation priorities of our company are unchanged. We continue to invest first and foremost in our business and the great opportunities that are in front of us. Business development is a strategic priority for us, and we will invest in business development as we have done in the past. We intend to continue to raise our dividend over time and we will then return any excess cash to our shareholders via share buyback. We do not intend to sit with multiple capacity on our balance sheet for periods of time and not use that cash in this regard. So I hope that addresses the use of our cash.\nOperator: It will be from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: So maybe just 1 M&A question. Can you just clarify whether any acquisition plans or that Merck will consider is likely to be all cash or if there would be a potential use of equity that would be or could be considered in a potential transaction.  And then separately, just wanted to get a little bit of the vision for V116? And where and how you see V116 competing in the overall market? Are we really just looking at that as a potential opportunity solely for adults? Or do you envision the '21 balance actually being a high-use target opportunity in the pediatric patient population as well. And then just trying to get a sense of timing of when we could see V116 actually competing in market and how you see the overall market evolving over time?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Obviously, business development remains a priority for us, as we've discussed. And importantly, we look to add wherever we can find the best science and innovations that enhance our pipeline and drive long-term growth and value for shareholders. I don't want to speculate on specific future transactions or the specific combination of cash or equity we would use because it really would be fact specific to the deal at hand. And so in that sense, I think we'd have to wait. The broader point, I think, that I want to enforce and we've said consistently is we have the capital and the balance sheet strength to go after anything that we feel is strategically important that brings that scientific innovation that I mentioned that will allow us to continue to augment what we have in our own internal pipeline. So we have the capacity and the flexibility to structure it, how we see best to optimize the business, how you do that between cash, debt and equity is really deal-specific.\nDean Li: Yes, in relationship to the questions that you had about V116, I just want to reiterate or reemphasize the strategy that we think, which is in different age groups or different populations, the stereotypes that are most troublesome for different populations is very different. So the whole focus of V116, the whole focus of the V116 is to recognize the serotypes that are specifically important for adults and to target that. And that's what V116 is, and that's why we had the first of 4 current Phase III trials that have to run its course. There is not a view from my standpoint, scientifically, that this is a vaccine that I would drive into the pediatric population because the epidemiology as of right now would suggest that, that would not be the right place to put this vaccines. We want to put the vaccines where the serotypes match what is happening to that patient population.\nRobert Davis: Yes. I might just add to that. If you look at it as we think about the future commercially, we see a real opportunity when you think about this bespoke approach where you have actions that we think will be highly effective in combating the serotypes that cause disease in infants and children as our pediatric approach. And then you have a separate approach with V116 aimed at the adult market. We will go after 85% of the residual disease, understanding that if you've treated it in children, you obviously have a different set of serotypes that are driving it in adults. And we are focusing on both of those as bespoke therapies aimed to what is most aligned with the needs in those populations. I think this will be highly effective and will allow us to be very competitive, in fact, cover more than what the competitor products cover in the disease-causing serotypes than you see today either in what they have in both the pediatric and adult market.  So I think this is something we're very excited about. And in fact, we see V116 as really fruition -- a strategy. So we're excited about it. and we're going to drive it with speed because I do think this is going to be an area where we can definitely be highly competitive and successful.\nOperator: That will come from Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: Dean, just real quick, I want to ask you, come back to the subcutaneous formulation of pembro. Is that Phase III in non-small cell still on track to read out early next year? And how should we think about sort of the clinical measures in that study, not just sort of -- I think the primary end points are around some of the biomarker endpoints? And should that study alone sort of be warranting a filing? Or should we be thinking about it differently?\nDean Li: Yes. So I just want to emphasize that trial is on track, and that trial should -- our intention is it should support filings? I should also emphasize that we have more than just 1 subcutaneous program and different images and different subcutaneous because we think that there may be a different patient population that will be important for different sort of formulations, the group formulations.  I should also emphasize that just like we have Q3 weeks and weeks Q3 weeks and Q6 weeks were intravenous. I think it's also important that we open up that possibility in the subcutaneous range as well.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thank you very much, Carter. Rob, any closing comments?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Well, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today, and maybe I'll just conclude by reiterating my appreciation for the tremendous efforts of the Merck team and really, we're continuing to perform exceedingly well in a tough environment to advance our science and ensure our important medicines and vaccines reach the patients around the world that are counting on us.  So I appreciate that, and I can tell you, I remain very confident in our underwriting momentum, and I look forward to continuing to give you updates on our progress as we move forward. With that, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. It's my pleasure to provide an update on our progress since the first quarter call. We continue to execute on our pipeline strategy. We are advancing the latest signs to generate medicines and vaccines that provide clear benefit for patients.  Today, I will highlight recent progress in our vaccine pipeline and provide an update on our oncology program as well as LAGEVRIO.  As Rob noted, we have made significant progress across our pneumococcal portfolio. Building upon the approval in the adult indication we received a year ago. Last month, we received FDA approval for our 15 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, VAXNEUVANCE an important new option to help protect pediatric populations against invasive pneumococcal disease.  VAXNEUVANCE is the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine approved for pediatric populations in almost a decade. VAXNEUVANCE provides comparable immunogenicity for 12 shared compared to the currently available 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, improved immunogenicity for serotype 3 and expanded coverage for serotype 22F and 33F.  Serotype 3, 22F and 33F are key invasive disease using serotypes known to be responsible for more than a quarter of all invasive pneumococcal disease in children.  Following FDA approval, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted unanimously to endorse VAXNEUVANCE as an option for children under 19 years of age.  Additionally, the ACID unanimously voted to include VAXNEUVANCE and the vaccines for children program. We await publication of the final CEC recommendation in the morbidity and mortality weekly report.  Also in June, at the International Symposium on pneumococi and pneumococcal diseases in Toronto, we presented positive results from our Phase I/II study evaluating V116, our investigation 21 delink pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in pneumococcal vaccine naive adult. V 116 is designed to significantly expand coverage compared to currently licensed pneumococcal vaccines by targeting serotypes that account for 85% of all invasive pneumococcal disease cases in adults aged 65 and older in the United States as of 2019.  As a strong indicator of our progress, we recently enrolled the first patient into the STRIDE 3 trial evaluating V116 in vaccine-naive adult, the first of 4 current Phase III trial.  We have taken a thoughtful and tailored approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidate designed to forward production by targeting strains posing the greatest risk to specific populations.  I look forward to providing additional updates on the progress of our pneumococcal program for VAXNEUVANCE, V116 and V117, our investigational candidate, specifically targeting pediatric disease.  Turning to oncology. We continue to build on the momentum in earlier-stage cancers. We announced that the FDA has accepted our application of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer following surgical reduction based on the results of the ongoing KEYNOTE-091 trial. The FDA has set a prescription drug user date of January 29, 2023. However, further data may be provided during the review process that may delay the state.  At the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting in June, we provided expanded analysis and presented data on new endpoints in key subgroups 4, KEYNOTE-716 and for the adjuvant treatment in Stage IIb and IC melanoma, KEYNOTE-522 in neoadjuvant high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and KEYNOTE-564 in adjuvant RCC.  We are also delivering on our regulatory strategy outside the United States. Notable actions include 4 approvals for KEYTRUDA from the European Commission based on KEYNOTE-716 for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with completely resected Stage IIb or 2C melanoma; KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer; KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158 in MSI high and/or mismatched for tumors in 5 different cancer types; and KEYNOTE-826 and certain types of persistent recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.  In addition, we received a positive EU CHMP opinion for adjuvant treatment with LYNPARZA for patients with serotypes of high-risk early-stage breast cancer based on the Phase II OLYMPIA trial.  And finally, we are encouraged by the positive readout of KEYNOTE-869 or EV-103 and first-line urothelial cancer, which is in collaboration with SGI.  Next, I want to discuss our ongoing efforts to treat prostate cancer. Prostate cancer impacts millions of men and those with advanced disease at low rates of 5-year survival. We continue to generate insight about prostate cancer from our ongoing work, and we remain focused on improving patient outcomes.  Business development and licensing remains a key element of our strategy to build and maintain a strong and diverse pipeline.  Earlier this month, we announced a global development and commercial relation agreement with Orion for investigational oral steroid synthesis inhibitor, ODM-208, which is currently in Phase II development for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.  ODM-208 targets cytochrome P450 1181, a novel approach that is complementary to our broad-based prostate cancer program, which includes the combination of KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091, KEYTRUDA with antiandrogen therapy based on KEYNOTE-641 and KEYNOTE-991 and LYNPARZA with anti-androgen therapy based on the PROPEL trial.  Next, to COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO the pandemic persists and SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve. There are solid emerging evidence for the threat of resistance to antibody therapies from Omicron variants, notably B4 and B5. The rate of transmission and increased hospitalization with these variants reinforces the need for multiple effective antiviral treatment options, especially for those most vulnerable. For high-risk patients, evidence continues to show that prompt therapeutic intervention improved outcome.  Importantly, a large proportion of high-risk individuals, including older adults, are likely receiving additional medications for chronic conditions. LAGEVRIO's low propensity for drug-drug interaction avoids the need to adjust existing dosing regimen and monitor liver and kidney functions during treatment, which can facilitate timely intervention for appropriate patients.  Recently, data reported from Denmark, Hong Kong and Poland have provided support for the utility of LAGEVRIO in real-world settings. We plan to share more data as they become available.  To conclude, I am proud of the advancements across our pipeline to date and look forward to providing further updates on our scientific primaries in the future.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter. I guess I will take this. This is Dean. In relationship to different routes of administration, I think you've highlighted that, especially as we go into early stages of cancer, there will be a demand, demand by the patients and the providers to really come up with other formulations besides intravenous formulations where you have to go to an infusion center. So subcutaneous pembrolizumab could be very important to serve that need. And the innovation required for subcutaneous KEYTRUDA is viewed through the past history, and I would imagine the current situation is novel, useful and nonobvious. So I think there is a path to think about how to think about that innovation.  In relationship to co-formulations. In general, co-formulations work well with, for example, when we do IO-IO with PD-1 that CTLA-4 TIGIT or LAG-3. The issue with chemo-based or antibody drug conjugate basis, I would be a little bit hesitant to do that. Oftentimes, they're based on weight base, and so I think that coal formulations of, for example, any IO agent with any chemotherapy or antibody drug conjugates could be challenging to take that clinically. So this is Dean. Thank you very much for those questions. tackle your first question related to our recently announced partnership with Kelyn. I should just emphasize this was recently announced, but we've had a productive, a really productive partnership for the past 2 years. And most recently, they have announced progress in 2 programs. One that they've declared, which relates to Trop-2 ADCs, and they're advancing it in China in relationship with breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.  In relationship to what you've said in moving those molecules for example, in the United States, I think the FDA and we support this. The FDA has been very clear of the importance of doing those trials, not in a single geography such as China, but to have global studies that include the United States. And so the ability for our partners to give us a signal in a human population is really important and allows us to navigate how to think about it at a global level. And so we are hopeful that this partnership will allow us to accelerate the benefits of this stroke to ADC to as many patients as possible.  To your second question in relationship with [indiscernible]. As you've noticed, is our nRTTI. It's extremely potent that has a resident time and tissue has a high barrier to resistance. And we had 2 Phase III studies that have excellent results. Nevertheless, we also had reduction in lymphocytes across a number of our programs, most of it a symptomatic, but in a combo trial with MK-8507, there was clinically meaningful reduction that's still dependent. We have spent the last 6 months understanding that. We understand it far better. We believe that there is a potential path forward to maintain and to have that efficacy and also reduce the effects on the blood cells. We are in active discussions with the FDA. So I don't want to get ahead of myself there, and we clearly have active discussions with our partners.  In relationship to the question of treatment and PREP, I just want to make sure that everyone recognizes we have always thought that this class of molecules NRTTI and islatravir is just 1 compound within this class could be broadly used in treatment and in PrEP, and we are interested in applying both of those -- advancing both of those possibilities, but we are in the midst of discussions with the FDA that I think we should provide them the data that they will need. Well, let me answer it from a scientific standpoint. Maybe we'll have Carolina or Rob answer it from a market standpoint. I do think it's really important to just highlight, at least for me, PD-1s have been incredible and metastatic through a broad range of tumor types. And we keep growing for earlier stages. And it's not apriority that a medicine that works in the metastatic patient who has a very different benefit/risk ratio will be truly effective in the early stage. And it's been impressive. We have 6 approvals, whether it be in breast, in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And we have a positive trial in relationship to lung, and we have many others advancing.  So I think that part of it is I think the uptake has been good, but the most important thing is that scientifically, the data has been very good. And I think the field will adopt it. I think one of the things that will be critical as the field adopts it is that oftentimes, you're now talking not necessarily about a medical oncologist. So there will be work for us to do, but I think the results speak for themselves. And I would recommend that people look at that data, and I think that it's an important advancement in the field. But in terms of the uptake, Caroline, do you want to take with that? All right. I'll take both of them, I'll take the Keynote-412. So you're speaking about the -- us trying to go into early stage at a neck and you're speaking about the -412, as you've emphasized, there was improvement in event-free survival who patients who received the KEYTRUDA regimen compared to the placebo plus DRT.  However, these results did not meet statistical significance based on our statistical plan. So there's clearly a positive signal, but it did cross the line. In relationship to -- how to think about CRT or radiation and other indications in this. I would not say that it gives you extra complication. We'll have to see in these other trials when -- not just us but other people in relationship to the combination there.  But I would just emphasize that it was an improvement in EFS. So I wouldn't say that it was a complicating issue for us. We just did need statistical significance.  I do want to make sure that everyone recognizes that this isn't our only foray into a neck early stage. We have a KEYNOTE-689 that's also in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment as well. So we're cautiously optimistic that we can break in into early stage at a neck despite the fact that KEYNOTE-412, it had a positive EFS did not lead to statistical significance.  In relationship to the pandemic, I need to be a little bit careful because everyone who's predicted what will happen with the pandemic have all had one common thread. They've all been not so right. And so we'll have to see what happens with the pandemic. We'll have to see what the emergence of resistance is, but I would emphasize the importance of having multiple mechanisms of action is clear. I would just emphasize that it is quite surprising to me how quickly this virus can mutate around those therapies, for example, focused on this like protein. That's actually it takes many amino-acid changes to do it. And it might take very few amino acids changes to get resistance to, for example, other therapies, but we'll have to see what it is. But I just want to also emphasize that, especially outside of the United States, there's been a great use of it and uptake, and it's really based on the fact that if you have a patient population where you believe that they're extremely vulnerable and you can give this drug and you're most interested in reducing mortality, which this drug has an impressive impact on mortality and you want speed such that you can really see the patient and who may be on multiple medicines, have other complicating medical issues and feel free that you can give this, if those are the important sort of attributes then we have found that LAGEVRIO does quite well and the real-world evidence throughout the world has begun to substantiate. Yes. So I'll -- this is Dean. I'll take the KEYNOTE-091 that's the lung adjuvant. And just to remind everyone, that had dual primary endpoints. And the reason I want to emphasize that is a dual primary means that if you hit on one of the endpoints, you have a positive trial. And this is a distinction from those trials that are co-primary where you have to hit on both. So this is a positive trial because in the disease-free survival, it's positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1.  The dual primary of DFS in terms of those with a TPS greater than 50%, there is a positive trend, but it's not significant. And the OS has got a trend as we move forward. I would imagine, as data matures people may want to see those data, and I just want to emphasize that in relationship to early-stage lung cancer, we have other trials as well, which is KEYNOTE-671, KEYNOTE-867 and KeyLink 012.  So I could imagine that as people deliberate on this, they will be interested in understanding how the data is maturing. These are event-driven and they're part of our FDA discussions and the PDUFA date, as you said, is January 29, 2023. But we could see a situation. There's nothing formally that's been asked of us, but we could see a situation where evolving data is asked for. Yes, in relationship to the questions that you had about V116, I just want to reiterate or reemphasize the strategy that we think, which is in different age groups or different populations, the stereotypes that are most troublesome for different populations is very different. So the whole focus of V116, the whole focus of the V116 is to recognize the serotypes that are specifically important for adults and to target that. And that's what V116 is, and that's why we had the first of 4 current Phase III trials that have to run its course. There is not a view from my standpoint, scientifically, that this is a vaccine that I would drive into the pediatric population because the epidemiology as of right now would suggest that, that would not be the right place to put this vaccines. We want to put the vaccines where the serotypes match what is happening to that patient population. Yes. So I just want to emphasize that trial is on track, and that trial should -- our intention is it should support filings? I should also emphasize that we have more than just 1 subcutaneous program and different images and different subcutaneous because we think that there may be a different patient population that will be important for different sort of formulations, the group formulations.  I should also emphasize that just like we have Q3 weeks and weeks Q3 weeks and Q6 weeks were intravenous. I think it's also important that we open up that possibility in the subcutaneous range as well."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are maintaining this year's strong momentum with another quarter of exceptional performance in both revenue and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our personal science as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is being enabled by the excellent execution of our dedicated products across the globe and continue to deliver value for patients, customers and shareholders.  company revenues were $14.6 billion, an increase of 28%. LAGEVRIO contributing $1.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the business delivered very strong growth of 18%.  The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business continued its strong momentum with growth of 33% or 21%, excluding LAGEVRIO driven by our key pillars. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance, with sales increasing 5% driven by growth across both our livestock and companion animal products.  Now turning to the second performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 30% to $5.3 billion, driven by the vast global demand as well as continued expansion into new indications and to reflect the preponed impact it is having more patients across the globe.  In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate momentum in metastatic indication and is experiencing strong growth from recent launches in early stage transfers, including triple-native breast renal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is now approved in 6 indications in earlier stage cancers.  We've seen strong utilization and are confident in its continued success as physician and patient experience growth. We have seen a particularly strong uptake in neoadjuvant adjuvant high-mileage triple-net breast cancer based on KEYNOTE-522, offering a distinct treatment patients in an area of significant unmet need.  In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA maintained the leadership position in non-small lung cancer capturing 8 out of 10 patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA was driven by continued uptake in non-small cell lung cancer and the ongoing in neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Initial indicators also point to encouraging trends in the United States indications, including breast cancer and renal carcinoma in key European markets.  The Lynparza remains a market-leading part inhibitor. Our revenue grew 17%, driven by uptaking patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer following FDA approval by [indiscernible]. We look forward to potentially expanding leadership by reaching the digital prospect cancer patients based on study.  Lenvima revenue grew 33% due to strong demand following the launch of in advanced renal cell carcinoma and PMOT775 in metastatic endometrial cancer. New patient target tumors remain strong.  Lastly, we continue to be encouraged by \u2022 WELIREG which is tracking in line with expectations. Portfolio again delivered excellent growth rate by GARDASIL, which increased 40% to $1.7 billion. Outside the U.S., GARDASIL significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand, particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S. that decrease primarily due to CDC purchasing patterns, although we continue to be impact from [indiscernible].  We continue to invest behind activation campaign to ensure that parents recognize the importance of routine division to their children, particularly during the [indiscernible]. We remain confident in the growth trajectory of GARDASIL given the proven ability to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males.  In our hospital acute care portfolio, sales was 15%, driven by greater share among and the increase in surgical procedures. Our animal health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 5%, grew 6%, driven by higher demand in and poultry. Companion animal sales increased 3% due to global demand for line of product.  I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 74.7%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points. The decrease was due to the impact of [indiscernible], higher inventory baseline increased manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable product mix across the remainder of the portfolio as foreign exchange.  Operating expenses decreased 19% to $5.2 billion, reflecting charges primarily related to last year's $1.7 million acquisition of which is reflected in our second quarter 2021 R&D expense. Operating expenses excluding these charges incline our plan, driven by investments in our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $200 million, reflecting higher-than-expected pension settlement effect.  Our tax rate was 13.8%. Taken together, we add $1.87 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business enables us to rate and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $57.5 billion and $58.5 billion. Our increased revenue guidance range represents growth of 18% to 20% or 13% to 14%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange.  The projected impact from burn exchange includes an incremental headwind of more than 1% using this July rent resulting a net impact of approximately 3%. We are maintaining our gross margin expectation of between 74% and 74.5%. We are increasing our operating expense projection to $20.5 billion to $21.5 billion, primarily driven by the $219 million upfront payment from the recently announced collaboration with Orion Corporation.  As an ongoing practice, our finance does not include significant potential when we development transaction. We increased our expectations of other expense to approximately $100 million, reflecting higher-than-anticipated pension settlement expense. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5%. We assumed 2.54 billion shares outstanding.  Taken together, we have managed our expected EPS range to $725 to $7.35. The operational front in our business would have led with approximately 20% increase in our guidance. This strength is being offset by the upfront entry to Orion, by pension settlement expense and an incremental headwind on foreign exchange more than 1% due in [indiscernible].  Overall, that guidance reflects our confidence that the strong underlying momentum of our business will continue into the second half of the year. As you consider your models, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the pandemic as a tailing to growth in the first half of the expect the benefits to yearly reset over the remainder of the year.  Also, we actively managed the impact of foreign exchange through our revenue saving program. To the extent we see further negative impact from foreign exchange, we will see additional benefits from our hedging in other revenues as we did in this quarter.  Other revenue also includes supply to Organon and the Johnson & Johnson for its COVID-19 vaccine as well as we see related to our out licensing arrangements. In total, we expect other revenue to be higher in the second half versus first half of 2022.  With respect to our products, for [indiscernible], we continue to expect a negative impact to U.S. sales, given the shift towards new adults pneumococcal vaccine. On Animal Health, we're seeing normalized industry growth rate as we adverse favorable trends in ending resulting from pandemic and experience foreign exchange headwinds. However, given our broad innovative portfolio, we are well positioned to continue to drive the market growth in 2022 and beyond.  Finally, we continue to expect to look at full year sales of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, with second half sales weighted to the fourth quarter.  Adaptation priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to clarify investments in our pipeline and business to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities in [indiscernible]. We continue to pursue compelling with strategic business development to augment our internal pipeline. Our recent collaboration with Orion is another example of our execution of this strategy.  We remain committed to our dividend, which we expect to increase through the time. Finally, to the extent we have extra cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases.  To conclude, at the end of the second half of the year, we remain very confident in business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our excellent execution will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Yes. Thank you, Dean. So Louis, we are really excited about the opportunities that we have moving into earlier stages of cancer. Clearly, if we can impact patients then, the possibilities of better outcomes are greater. We have seen in our early-stage cancers impressive performance. We're seeing very strong performance in triple-negative breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. And if I just touch on triple-negative breast cancer, we had the KEYNOTE-522 approval here in the United States July of last year.  During the second part of last year, we saw tremendous uptake in the first segment of treatment, the neoadjuvant treatment ahead of people then getting their surgery some 24 weeks later. What we're now seeing is not only patients coming on to KEYTRUDA for neoadjuvent triple-negative breast cancer. We're also seeing them return to treatment following their surgery. So we're very optimistic about the opportunities we have in the adjuvant setting and the impact that we can have on patients. And Jeff, this is Caroline. The only thing I would add in terms of further investments is our belief in the molecule as being a molecule that could be impactful not only against COVID-19, but also pan coronavirus, RSA and flu. And as a result, we will invest in appropriate programs to try and prove that out. And Mara, in response to your question on our utilization of excess cash, the capital allocation priorities of our company are unchanged. We continue to invest first and foremost in our business and the great opportunities that are in front of us. Business development is a strategic priority for us, and we will invest in business development as we have done in the past. We intend to continue to raise our dividend over time and we will then return any excess cash to our shareholders via share buyback. We do not intend to sit with multiple capacity on our balance sheet for periods of time and not use that cash in this regard. So I hope that addresses the use of our cash."

            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. I'm proud to report that the business continues to perform extremely well. We remain firmly guided by our strategic priorities to bid long-term growth and deliver value to patients and shareholders. We're executing on the opportunities in front of us today, while simultaneously making the necessary investments to sustain our success long into the future. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter, we achieved robust top and bottom line growth and made additional important clinical advancements in our pipeline.  Turning first to our results. We again achieved exceptional performance this quarter led by strong growth of key products, including KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and BRIDION. Our results rated by revenue from LAGEVRIO, which is helping to in fighting COVID-19. We're confident in the underlying demand for our innovative portfolio as we continue to see momentum in our business, which we are pleased to reflect our updated guidance.  Moving to research organization. We continue to advance our pipeline most significantly across our suite of pneumococcal vaccines. VAXNEUVANCE received an expanded approval from the FDA for pediatric case, providing an important option for sort in prevention invasive in pneumococcal disease.  We also presented by the results from clinical studies of V116, our vaccine, designed specifically to address remaining of in adults, and we've initiated difficult phase III studies. These milestones reinforce the confidence we have in our population specific approach to address the needs of children and adults.  We've also taken additional taste understand the significant opportunities we see in the pipeline. In June, we hosted an investor event at ASCO. We highlighted the depth and breadth of our oncology program. At the event, we reiterated our ambition to become the leading oncology company by 2025 and our goal of sustaining this success well into the next decade.  As I reflect on my first year as CEO, I'm pretty pleased by the significant progress we've made in advancing worth position as a global pharmaceutical leader and the interim momentum starting across our business. The unwavering focused indication of our employees worldwide is driving strong execution on significant opportunity in front of us. We're demonstrating impressive resilience across all aspects of our business in a every challenging global environment. We're achieving market levels of production in our manufacturing operations, delivering exceptionally strong revenue growth, making meaningful bands in our pipeline and taking important steps to expand our outlook. Our strategy is working and our future is bright. I was very confident a year ago, and I'm even more confident today that we are well positioned to achieve our near and long-term goals, anchored by our commitment to deliver important medicines and vaccines to patients and value to all of our stakeholders, including shareholders.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Yes. Evan, thanks for the question. This is Rob. As you said, there is reports out really just came out yesterday of a potential deal with the Senator and in that is elements of what have been part of the build back better plan related to drug pricing. So as we look at that, I think it's important to understand, first and foremost, we do have significant concern on one very important element of the provision, which is the fact that there is what we see as price setting, it's termed in negotiation. But in effect, what it is, it is price setting on drugs after a period of time. And we do believe that will be highly chilling on future innovation because, especially if you think about an area like oncology, oncology is an area that the development of the drug continues long after the first approval. If you take KEYTRUDA, the launch in 2014 between 2014 and 2022, we had something like 30-plus indications approved. We expect to have well more than double that between 2022 and 2028. And our concern is that if you start to have the threat of discounts, mandatory discounts that could cause companies to question that innovation because you'll have to question whether or not you're going to see the return.  So we see a higher chilling effect of that, and it's something that we will continue both at and as the industry to make sure that we communicate our concerns there.  And the only other thing I might add is, as you think about how we think about this to our business going forward. It's important to understand that as we look at this, while obviously, it will have an impact, importantly, as we've planned for the future of the business, we have always assumed some form of price pressure coming, including in the United States. I think we've communicated that in the past. So as we look at this, and you think of a relative to the guidance we've given in the past of expectations for strong growth through our long-range period. That continues and includes the assumptions around this. So while I think we will manage it, I do worry about what it will do to innovation in the industry. Yes. I appreciate the questions. And on your first question around the M&A space and what we see in the oncology field. No, I would just start by saying, obviously, we are very proud of the success we've had with KEYTRUDA and the fact that it's been able to impact so many people's lives, as you say, across so many different tumor types. But I think it's important to understand that oncology continues to be an incredibly competitive field, and importantly, it's not monolithic. You have to look tumor by tumor and even modalities, whether it's I/O or targeted therapy. So there are multiple different approaches, multiple modalities and it is a very tumor specific. And as you know, we have to develop these drugs indication by indication of investing in the science to bring each of those forward.  And in that regard, as we look at it and as we thought about it, we continue to believe that while the environment is more complex. And obviously, we'll have to be very thoughtful on how we navigate it I believe, we believe, as long as we are doing deals that are science-driven, where we accelerate innovation, and we can show that we can expand access to patients around the world and in the United States to medicines that there are still deals to be done and that there's a path to move forward.  And so that's very much where we're focusing and why we continue to believe the opportunity exists to continue to expand treatments for patients and and for the benefit of, frankly, all stakeholders, including shareholders.  On your second question, and I think it depends on the way you look at it. as far as the upcoming regulation. Obviously, if you look across what is being proposed, if you're speaking specifically to the potential for mandatory price discounting at some point. Obviously, the language has to be finalized. But if you look at where it is today, the way it is being proposed is that for a period of time after a drug is approved during its period of exclusivity for -- right now, it's roughly 7 years for negotiation for slow molecules, 11 years for large molecules, you were able to operate with no discount.  At that period of time, there would be a discussion and opportunity for HSS to select the drug depending on their determination of which drugs to look at. Right now is the language as discussed, we'll pick 10 drugs a year and up to the HSS to determine which drug they pick. But importantly, then the negotiation itself once it is done and the discount is determined and that discount is outlined in the legislation would take effect at year 9 for a small molecule year for a large molecule. So as you think of something like KEYTRUDA, we're really talking about periods of time that are out around the time of loss of exclusivity in 2028. And obviously, there's other language that's being proposed potentially to allow for an exception if there are biosimilar products in development coming that then you would not be subject to it.  So the reality of it is it's unclear what the impact will be in the short term, we don't see impacts from that specific part of the regulation. It will be longer term as it relates to our important drugs, KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. And then obviously, we have to see how the final language comes out. But in the language or then the specified discounts that will be set. So it's not reference price in the way they're setting it up right now. And then obviously, beyond that, there is what they have around the Part B reforms, which actually we support because we believe that will reduce the out-of-pocket costs for patients at the counter, but our -- the reason we continue to oppose the overall legislation is a strong belief that, that focus on mandatory discounts after a period of time as chilling innovation. So I'm not sure I got your question, but I think that's what you were trying to get at. Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Obviously, business development remains a priority for us, as we've discussed. And importantly, we look to add wherever we can find the best science and innovations that enhance our pipeline and drive long-term growth and value for shareholders. I don't want to speculate on specific future transactions or the specific combination of cash or equity we would use because it really would be fact specific to the deal at hand. And so in that sense, I think we'd have to wait. The broader point, I think, that I want to enforce and we've said consistently is we have the capital and the balance sheet strength to go after anything that we feel is strategically important that brings that scientific innovation that I mentioned that will allow us to continue to augment what we have in our own internal pipeline. So we have the capacity and the flexibility to structure it, how we see best to optimize the business, how you do that between cash, debt and equity is really deal-specific. Yes. I might just add to that. If you look at it as we think about the future commercially, we see a real opportunity when you think about this bespoke approach where you have actions that we think will be highly effective in combating the serotypes that cause disease in infants and children as our pediatric approach. And then you have a separate approach with V116 aimed at the adult market. We will go after 85% of the residual disease, understanding that if you've treated it in children, you obviously have a different set of serotypes that are driving it in adults. And we are focusing on both of those as bespoke therapies aimed to what is most aligned with the needs in those populations. I think this will be highly effective and will allow us to be very competitive, in fact, cover more than what the competitor products cover in the disease-causing serotypes than you see today either in what they have in both the pediatric and adult market.  So I think this is something we're very excited about. And in fact, we see V116 as really fruition -- a strategy. So we're excited about it. and we're going to drive it with speed because I do think this is going to be an area where we can definitely be highly competitive and successful. Yes. Well, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today, and maybe I'll just conclude by reiterating my appreciation for the tremendous efforts of the Merck team and really, we're continuing to perform exceedingly well in a tough environment to advance our science and ensure our important medicines and vaccines reach the patients around the world that are counting on us.  So I appreciate that, and I can tell you, I remain very confident in our underwriting momentum, and I look forward to continuing to give you updates on our progress as we move forward. With that, have a great day."

The presentation, today's earnings release as well as our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I get started, let me take a moment to speak about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We're hopeful for an immediate and peaceful resolution to the Russian and Basin of the country, and we support the Ukrainian people and stand with them, and recognize what a terrible tragedy this represents. Merck is making every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and to ensure essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach patients. In addition, we are dedicating meaningful resources to address the humanitarian crisis in the country through multiple channels. Turning to our business. We continue to deliver across our key strategic priorities in the first quarter. We're sustaining the strong business momentum we delivered in 2021 with robust top and bottom line growth. We've also achieved significant clinical advancements across our research pipeline and successfully integrated Acceleron. Now moving to our results. We've had a strong start to 2022, achieving very strong top and bottom line growth. Commercially, we continue to execute well across a broad set of key growth drivers most notably, KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. Our performance reflects robust underlying demand for our derisked innovative portfolio and reinforces the importance of our science-led strategy. LAGEVRIO, our COVID-19 antiviral treatment, was a significant contributor as well. But even excluding these sales, our top line growth was still overtly 19% versus last year. On LAGEVRIO, we've accelerated broad global access, and it's now established as an important tool for patients and health care providers to address the ongoing pandemic. Since receiving emergency use authorization in December, we've delivered approximately 6.4 million courses to more than 30 countries. The success we are achieving is reflected in our updated 2022 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation for another year of strong growth and overall business momentum. Our oncology business is benefiting from the continued rollout of new and important indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Global demand for GARDASIL remains strong and growth will benefit from increased supply as a result of the significant investments we are making to expand manufacturing capacity, and our Animal Health business remains positioned to grow at above market rates. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion through 2025. We're preparing for the post KEYTRUDA LOE period by continuing to strengthen the levers we have and building upon them in order to deliver long-term growth. In oncology, we remain committed to building on the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA and we aim to expand our presence in this key therapeutic area and to establish an enduring leadership position. In addition, we'll continue to maximize the opportunities we see for our durable growth drivers, such as GARDASIL, our pneumococcal portfolio and Animal Health through our proven commercial execution. Beyond our existing portfolio, business development remains a key priority. We remain highly focused in our pursuit of the best external innovation and will be appropriately aggressive when great science and value align. We have a strong track record of business development, but we know we need to do more. And we believe we are well positioned to quickly deploy capital towards the right strategic assets as they present themselves. And finally, we'll continue to advance our broad pipeline across key therapeutic areas in order to deliver medically important innovations to patients. We've taken important steps to provide increased transparency into the opportunities we see in our portfolio and our business, including through two recent investor events. Earlier this month, we provided a detailed description of our growing cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline. And Merck, we're focusing our efforts where the needs are greatest and where we have the best opportunity to positively impact patients' lives, including in heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis and atherosclerosis. We've made significant advancements across our CV pipeline and believe our broad differentiated portfolio can have meaningful impacts on patients' lives with at least eight potential new approvals by 2030. We're confident that these important innovations have the potential to be meaningful growth drivers for Merck well into the next decade. And in February, we hosted our inaugural ESG event which highlighted our activities in our four priority areas of access to health, employees, environmental sustainability and ethics and values. Our ESG efforts are grounded in our company's values and we look forward to building on Merck's legacy of operating responsibly going forward. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Roy Baynes, who has announced his retirement after eight years at Merck. Roy has been instrumental in helping Merck become a leading oncology company, particularly through his leadership in the development of KEYTRUDA. We wish Roy the best in his future endeavors and we're confident that he leaves behind an outstanding team and program. I'm pleased to report that Dr. Eliav Barr was appointed to succeed Roy. Eliav not only has deep experience having served in several research capacities throughout his more than two decades at Merck, but also has an unwavering commitment to patients consistent with Merck's purpose to save and improve lives. In summary, we've begun 2022 with strong operational momentum, and I want to express my sincere thanks to our employees worldwide for their continued folk commitment. We remain confident in our fundamental strategy, our growth prospects and in our ability to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we have had a very strong start to 2022 with exceptional performance in both revenues and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our focus on science and innovation at the core of our strategy, enabled by excellent execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe, is delivering value for patients, customers and investors. Total company revenues were $15.9 billion, an increase of 50%. LAGEVRIO contributed $3.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the base business delivered very strong growth of 19%. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the human health business grew 21% driven primarily by our key pillars as well as the reduced impact of the pandemic. Our Animal Health business also delivered above-market performance with sales increasing 9% driven by growth across both companion animals and livestock segments. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 27% to $4.8 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand and the expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth across all key tumors and is benefiting from recent launches in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is currently approved to treat five indications in earlier stage cancers, and we are excited about the potential opportunity to expand into adjuvant lung cancer based on the encouraging data from KEYNOTE-091. We continue to be confident that KEYTRUDA's robust clinical data, combined with physicians' familiarity and experience with the product, will support expanded use and patient benefit in early-stage disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA's growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Our alliance revenue grew 20%, driven by uptake in metastatic breast cancer. We are also excited by the expanded opportunity in early stage breast cancer, following the recent FDA approval based on the OlympiA study. Further, we look forward to potentially reaching a broad prostate population based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue also had very strong growth driven by uptake following the launches of KEYNOTE-581 in advanced renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-775 in metastatic endometrial cancer, where we are seeing encouraging new patient share trends across each of these tumor types. Lenvima growth also benefited from increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma in China and certain onetime items. We are also excited by the launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients. Although still early in its launch, WELIREG has had strong uptake, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need for these patients. We are working to potentially extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our vaccines portfolio again delivered excellent performance led by GARDASIL, which increased 60% to $1.5 billion. Outside the U.S., significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand across key geographies and particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S., sales increased due to the timing of CDC practices. Global demand for GARDASIL remains robust support strong clinical and real-world data as well as efforts to increase the recognition of GARDASIL as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 20%, driven by the ongoing recovery in surgical procedures during the quarter and continued strong leadership of the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of robust growth, with sales increasing 9%. Companion animal sales increased 13%, driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products as well as vaccines. Livestock sales increased 7% due to higher demand in ruminant and poultry. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 70.7%, a decrease of 5.9 percentage points, driven primarily by higher LAGEVRIO sales. As a reminder, we share profits from LAGEVRIO equally with our partner Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin percentage. Gross margin this quarter also reflects favorable impact of product mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 7% to $4.8 billion as we continue to prudently invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $140 million. Our tax rate was 14%. Taken together, we earned $2.14 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, at the request of the SEC, certain companies in our industry, including ours, have made changes to non-GAAP reporting. We will no longer exclude significant expenses for upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements as well as transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions from non-GAAP results. As a result, $1.7 billion of R&D charges primarily related to the acquisition of Pandion are now included in our recast 2021 non-GAAP results. This increased R&D expense by $1.7 billion and decreased non-GAAP EPS by $0.65. There was no impact to the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. Our 2022 guidance does not assume any significant transactions that would have previously been excluded from non-GAAP. So this could change in future quarters if we execute business development which is a strategic priority. The underlying strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $56.9 billion and $58.1 billion, representing growth of 17% to 19% or 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of approximately $200 million using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of just over 2%. We are increasing our gross margin expectation to between 74% and 74.5%. We expect operating expenses of $20.3 billion to $21.3 billion. At the midpoint, this is consistent with what was implied by our prior guidance. We expect other expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5% due to an increase in estimated U.S. taxes to be paid on foreign income. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased our expected EPS range to $7.24 to $7.36, representing pull-through of the operational strength from our key pillars and operating expense leverage, offset in part by a slight reduction in the top end of our LAGEVRIO sales assumption, the increase in our tax rate and an incremental 1% headwind from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on LAGEVRIO, we are narrowing the range of our full year guidance to $5 billion to $5.5 billion. We have entered into supply and purchase agreements for approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Since authorization, we delivered 6.4 million courses of therapy, including 5 million in the first quarter. We expect approximately half of the remaining full year revenue from LAGEVRIO in the second quarter. We continue to expect strong annual growth for GARDASIL, especially in ex-U.S. markets, including China. Finally, as a reminder, our other revenue line contains several items, including supply sales to Organon, which we began recording upon the completion of the spin-off last year and to Johnson & Johnson for its COVID vaccine. Also included are our revenue hedge and royalties. Other revenue in the first quarter also benefited from approximately $100 million in receipts relating to out-licensing agreement. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in augmenting our internal pipeline through strategic business development, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent, we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we remain very confident in the growth of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and our shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. It is good to be here to provide an update on our progress. In the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate progress in our pipeline. We made advances across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology in both advanced and earlier stages of cancer as well as in cardiovascular disease and vaccines. I will also provide an update on LAGEVRIO. In oncology, we continue to build upon our strong position and execute on our strategy to expand, deepen and extend benefits to patients and diversify our imprint on cancer. This past quarter, we achieved milestones from several tumor types as well as different stages of disease. Notably, we continue to expand our treatment impact in earlier stages of disease where we now have six approvals from the FDA, five for KEYTRUDA and one for Lynparza. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual plenary session last month, data from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARL trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage Ib to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection were presented. At an interim analysis, KEYTRUDA has significantly improved disease-free survival in all comers, one of the study's dual primary endpoint. The trial will continue to analyze the other dual primary endpoint of disease-free survival in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis. These latest data provide a strong signal for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant treatment study. Additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer include KEYNOTE-671, which is evaluating neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable 2, 3A and 3B disease; KEYNOTE-867, which is studying stereotactic body radiotherapy with or without KEYTRUDA in adults with unreflected Stage 1 HER2 disease, and PLN12 where we are studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage 3 disease. Following the approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma following complete resection based on KEYNOTE-716, we announced that at a prespecified interim analysis, the study also met its secondary endpoint of distinct metastasis-free survival and showed continued improvement in recurrent free survival compared to placebo. The data from KEYNOTE-716 reinforces the evidence for KEYTRUDA as adjuvant therapy for appropriate patients with Stage IIB and IIC following surgery that help prevent recurrence of disease. Now similarly, in the earlier-stage setting, along with AstraZeneca, we announced Lynparza was approved by the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with germline BRCA patients with HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy either before or after surgery based on the OlympiA study. Further, in women's cancer, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with microsatellite instability high, or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma based on new data for KEYNOTE-158. Now this approval is a fourth gynecologic cancer approval for KEYTRUDA and marks the fifth approval derived from the KEYNOTE-158 trial, an innovative trial designed to evaluate the use of predictive tumor biomarkers in patients receiving KEYTRUDA for advanced solid tumors. Next, the prostate cancer. Along with AstraZeneca, positive results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancer Symposium for the PROPEL trial evaluating Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic casted resistant prostate cancer with and without mutations and a group of homologous recombination repair gene. At a planned interim analysis, results showed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival versus the standard of care. These early results also showed a trend towards improved overall survival. The trial will continue to assess these key secondary endpoints when we plan to engage with health authorities to discuss the findings with the aim of bringing this important option to appropriate patients. Prostate cancer represents a significant unmet need, and we are continually gaining important insights into the biology of the tumor. We are keen on making an impact for patients with late-stage disease. Last month, we announced the discontinuation of the KEYLYNK-010 study, evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. At an interim analysis, this study showed no evidence of superiority to abiraterone enzalutamide with respect to overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. Our attention in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer now shifts to KEYNOTE-921, a study exploring the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy, and KEYNOTE-641, which is evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and enzalutamide. Outside of the United States, we continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. Notable actions include positive CHMP opinions for cervical, MSI high and early stage breast cancer in Europe and approvals for the combination regimen of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan. And finally, to coincide with ASCO, in early June, we are planning to host an investor event in Chicago. At our recent cardiovascular investor event, we showcased our growing portfolio of programs targeting a range of conditions, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension and thrombosis. Following the completion of our acquisition of Acceleron Pharma, we are making strong progress in advancing the development of sotatercept, a potential first-in-class valuable activin receptor type 2A fusion protein. We recently completed enrollment for the STELLAR trial ahead of schedule. STELLAR is the first of four ongoing Phase III studies evaluating sotatercept. This progress reflects enthusiasm from investigators regarding this novel investigational mechanism. For the first time, the 2022 American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and Heart Failure Society of America, guideline for the management of heart failure included Verquvo, which we collaborate on with our partner, Bayer, as a Class IIB recommendation for the treatment of Stage C heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The guideline highlights this mechanism of sGC such as Verquvo and the potential benefits of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP. Based on evidence from the pioneering VICTORIA trial, Verquvo is the first drug specifically studied and approved for patients with worsening heart failure and the only drug recommended in the new guidelines for these patients. Our ongoing VICTOR study is designed to expand on the evidence to date by evaluating Verquvo in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who have not experienced a recent worsening heart failure events. Merck is uniquely positioned to meaningfully impact the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease with at least eight potential approvals by 2030, including Verquvo and stable heart failure and sotatercept as well as our pipeline of candidates, including an entailed soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, a Factor XI inhibitor and an oral PCSK9 inhibitor. Next, the COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO. As the pandemic evolve, there continues to be regional surges in infection rates with the emergence of new COVID-19 variance. Now some of these strains are resistant to specific monoclonal antibody regimens and appear able to evade some vaccine protection, highlighting the importance of testing and the availability of antiviral option. At the recent European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, we presented Phase III virology outcomes data for move out, adding to the growing body of evidence for the antiviral properties of LAGEVRIO. The panoramic trial evaluating novel antivirals for early treatment, which is being sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the U.K. government and the MOVe-AHEAD trial evaluating LAGEVRIO for post-exposure prophylaxis are both ongoing. We are working collaboratively with the European Medicines Agency to provide additional data from these trials in order to secure an approval. We remain confident in the safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO in appropriate patients. In particular, we believe it's low propensity for drug-drug interactions makes it an important option for patients. Next, on our pneumococcal program. Earlier this month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date for the supplemental biologics license application for VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants and children to July 1, 2022. The agency requested additional analyses of data, which we provided. Importantly, no new studies were requested. Also in our new pneumococcal program, we received breakthrough therapy designation for V116, our investigational PCV that is designed to target serotypes responsible for approximately 80% of the residual invasive disease in the older adult population and includes eight unique serotypes not in currently licensed vaccine. We look forward to providing deeper updates. In closing, I would like to thank Roy Baynes for his many contributions to Merck over the past eight years. As we build upon his legacy, I'm constantly reminded of wisdom and teaching and I'm grateful to work with a remarkable team he has trained and mentored. One of those mentees, of course, is Eliav Barr. Eliav's experience commitment to Merck's purpose of saving and improving lives makes him the ideal leader of our global clinical development program. Eliav has a wealth of experience, holding leadership roles across an array of therapeutic areas during his 27 years at Merck, including vaccine, infectious disease, and oncology. I look forward to continuing to partner with Eliav to build upon Merck's legacy of innovation and breakthrough size. And now back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Grace, if you could please begin the Q&A. And we request that analysts limit themselves to one question each to get to as many questioners as possible. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Your line is open.\nEd Carter: This is Ed Carter on for Carter. We wanted to ask about GARDASIL. If you could talk about any impact you're seeing in China, either from a demand perspective or disruptions to manufacturing? And in that context, should we think about cadence -- or should we think about cadence over the year being notably different than in the years past? There's just a lot of different crosses play. So any color there would be helpful.\nCaroline Litchfield: Carter, this is Caroline. Thank you very much for the question. GARDASIL continues to be a great growth driver for our company globally, including China. Specific to China, we saw strong performance in the quarter, and we expect continued strong performance as we go through this year. We have significant demand in China. And as they're off flares, as a result of COVID and potentially lockdown in one part of the country, we have the ability to ensure that we're supplying more of the GARDASIL doses to other parts of the country. So we're, therefore, not anticipating a significant impact to our GARDASIL performance in China as a result of what we're seeing in Shanghai at this moment in time. As it pertains to our supply chain, our company has a very robust supply chain. And we have Plan A and Plan B, if there are any interruptions in the supply chain. So we, again, have no concern for the reliability of our supply chain, but we remain vigilant and focused on the situation at hand.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Congrats on the quarter. So one question we're getting a lot is, how do you feel about potential challenge from a competitor or for PDL1 and TIGIT combo, potentially looking better than KEYTRUDA first-line PD-L1-high lung cancer? Do you see this as a major threat, especially looking at the Phase II data from that competitor TIGIT?\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you for that question. So I just wanted to emphasize the question focuses on the addition of another checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on top of PD-1. And this is a strategy to sort of deepen the response of PD-1 and PD-L1. I think it will be very important to see that data and look at the contribution of components. And really, we're -- we have a TIGIT program that we're also advancing in non-small cell lung cancer and small lung cancer. So, the field will have to sort of see as the data evolves, how much does TIGIT add to PD-1 in the lung space. But I do want to make a broader sort of comment, which is you'll see movements in TIGIT that was recently movement in PD-1, and CPLA4 and PD-1 and LAG-3. What you recognize as each of those combinations, what they do is if you're able to show a benefit of the additional agent, it doesn't have as broad of an impact as PD-1 has in many different tumors. And so, one of the things that I think is important to highlight is our strategy is not to just be invested in LAG-3, not to be just invested in CPLA4, not be just invested in TIGIT, but to be invested in all three and to focus them in specific tumor types.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nSeamus Fernandez: So, just really wanted to focus in on sotatercept and the six-minute walk test as the primary endpoint. If you guys could just help us understand what is being done in the clinical trial to really manage closely the risk that sort of a subjective endpoint represents? Or is your confidence that the magnitude of the difference that you saw in the Phase II will comfortably cover the challenges of the six-minute walk test that we've seen in some other studies given some placebo responses that raised levels of concern? So just love to get your thoughts there.\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. So thank you so much for that question in relationship to sotatercept. So just to reemphasize, we have three different trials, all driving towards somewhat different outcomes, the six-minute walk, which is the STELLAR trial. There's also time to clinical worsening, and then there's also even harder outcomes past that. And as you point out, each one of those is sort of ratcheting up what sotatercept can do. In relationship to the first one, which is STELLAR, which is related to what you said, the six-minute walk test, where we saw actually quite impressive data and relationships to the Phase II, we have very committed patient groups as well as sites who are very well trained in how to do these trials. And the Phase II was really nice data. And the fundamental issue is that we are confident that many of those same sites that were involved with the Phase II are involved with Phase III. So I think we're confident we'll see what that data is. But the best predictor of how well we can manage those trials is really the best indicator is the Phase II, and we're using very many sites and the investigators. So, we have great confidence in that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Chris Schott from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Maybe just a two-parter around kind of corporate structure. I guess first, business development landscape. I know you talked about this as a priority. I guess it's been another kind of quarter of weak equity market performance in the biotech side. So, I guess, are you seeing any change in willingness on the part of some of the targets to engage or any resets in valuations that could enable some of these business development kind of activities to move forward? And then Rob, just a kind of a tangential question on that is broadly across the pharma group, I think we've been seeing asset divestitures of nontraditional pharma businesses. I know you viewed Animal Health as more core to the Company. But have your thoughts evolved at all, I guess is your time as CEO and when you look at your implied kind of core form valuation given where some of the animal health multiples trade? So, so any incremental perspective there would be appreciated.\nRob Davis: Great. Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, on the BD landscape question, the short answer is we are not seeing a fundamental shift in seller expectations as of this point. I think as time continues, if we see the market reset to become more permanent and more importantly, if the IPO market continues to be challenged for biotech companies, that might change over time as companies become more cash constrained. There are some smaller players that do have cash challenges. So I think that's where you could see movement first. But fundamentally, we've not seen a change in the landscape yet. We'll have to continue to watch. With regards to the Animal Health business, our view continues to be that the Animal Health business, as you said, is core to the Company. It's core to our strategy as part of a growth driver for the Company. But as we've always said, we look at this regularly. We always are challenging ourselves to ask, what is the long-term value creation opportunity of this business in our hands relative to what would be outside of the Company? And on a long-term view, we continue to believe it is best in our hands as part of the Company. But if that situation evolves, we obviously will continue to be objective in how we analyze that. But we do not look at the short-term the arbitrage opportunity for us. It's more about the long-term value creation, and that has not changed as of now.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up, we have Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: If I could ask a question on KEYTRUDA, the strength, particularly out of the U.S. this quarter, if you could help us with some of the underpinnings there? And relatedly, longer term, 2025, I think you framed how KEYTRUDA, your objective is to have -- I guess the wording changed slightly. You were previously looking for 30% coming from adjuvant with your focus framed around the U.S. If I'm reading it correctly, you brought in the framework here to now think about it as 25% on a global basis. Maybe update us on where you feel you are in terms of making progress towards achieving those objectives of the adjuvant revenue contribution?\nRob Davis: Yes. So Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question then Caroline can jump in for the second part. On the strength of the growth we're seeing in the United States, this is really a testament to what we've been talking about all along, which is as we continue to roll out new indications, we are continuing to see our share grow as the leading I-O agent. And importantly, I would highlight that the growth we saw among other things in the quarter, continuation of our position in renal cell carcinoma, continuation of the growth we're seeing in head and neck. In RCC, obviously, being a first-line treatment in the metastatic setting as well as now having adjuvant therapy as well, we've covered pretty much the waterfront of RCC, and we have the opportunity to continue to grow there. But the standout frankly, for the quarter, and it's, I think, really important to understand is triple-negative breast cancer, both in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant setting. We are seeing incredible growth in that space and it's something that we feel very proud of because I think we're going to have a meaningful difference there. The reason I highlight that is both -- if you look at the adjuvant opportunity there and the growth we're getting as well, as I mentioned, in adjuvant RCC, I think it just reinforces what we see as the future, which is the growth contribution from the earlier lines of therapy long term. But with that, maybe Caroline can be specific to some of the guidance we've provided.\nCaroline Litchfield: So to Rob's point, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have for adjuvant and the impact that, that has on patients. We initially shared that we expected 50% of our growth to come from adjuvant, representing 30% of the U.S. business. We have now extended that to say 50% of the growth will come from adjuvant, representing 25% of our global business in the year 2025. And to Rob's point, our early introductions into the earlier-stage cancers with five indications now in KEYTRUDA are putting us on a very good course to have this impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Maybe let me touch up on molnupiravir real quick. I think the total utilization to date is about 200,000 courses through mid-April. And it looks like, at least based on third-party data sets that the Pfizer regimen is getting used 8 to 10x more than molnupiravir. So I guess my question is, if only a couple hundred thousand courses have been used through mid-April and 3.1 million courses were contracted to U.S., is there any recourse for U.S. to return a chunk of these courses back? And I'm asking because some of these sales have been recorded in P&L. I just want to make sure they're permanent sales.\nRob Davis: Yes. I'll let Caroline maybe address this.\nCaroline Litchfield: So Umer, thanks for the question. First, let me start. We're proud of molnupiravir, LAGEVRIO and the impact that it can have on the world. And it has impact to the comments that Dean made given its importance, especially in patients that have drug-to-drug interactions. The data that we have access to suggest that we have actually had utilization by 500,000 patients globally at this stage. We have shipped 6.4 million courses as of now. Both shipments represent expectations for utilization over a period of time. And we're actually seeing extremely strong utilization, especially in ex-U.S. markets, where the statistics you quote are actually reversed in some of the markets. We have a very strong market share. So as we sit here today, we've guided on the $5 million to $5.5 billion based on the contracts that we have in hand, and we are confident in that in our financials.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Daina Graybosch from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: I have another one on KEYTRUDA in early stage. Can you guys talk to how the success of Opdivo plus chemotherapy in neoadjuvant lung cancer changes your expectations or strategy for the early-stage opportunities in lung cancer and in the other tumor?\nDr. Dean Li: Yes, thank you very much for that question. In relationship to sort of just earlier stage in lung cancer, I think it's really important to emphasize there's a series of different ways to approach it. One is neoadjuvant, adjuvant. One is adjuvant. And I just think all of these signals just demonstrate throughout a variety of different studies just the impact that PD-1s can have. So our point of view of it is it shouldn't change our strategy. It should just make our strategy pretty comprehensive. The fundamental thing is we have KEYNOTE-091, which is in the adjuvant, so that's post-surgery, and that's usually given by a medical oncologist, the disease-free survival was positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1. There was a trend to TPS greater than 50%, but not statistically significant. And OS, it was a favorable trend regardless of PD-L1. So we'll be letting that data mature as we continue to discuss with the FDA. But going -- to your point, it's not just KEYNOTE-091. It's KEYNOTE-671. It's KEYNOTE-867. It's KEYLYNK-012. It's all in the earlier stage. So our desire to really push that earlier stage is going to be -- if anything, our commitment towards that is even greater. The one thing I would just add in relationship to some of the comments that Caroline and Rob made is that I think it's very important to think about melanoma renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, where at least my experience being in the hospital, there's a concept of really looking at that earlier stage. And I think uptake may be sort of built in the medical system. I think all of us, including us and other companies as well as patient advocacies and medical centers are going to have to require diligent investment to really, really maximize the important scientific impacts of KEYTRUDA and PD-1s and PD-L1s in the early lung space.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: I'd just like to thank Roy for all the contributions and insights over the years. The question is on your Factor XI monoclonal. Given your background in cardiology, and I'm sure you keep familiarity with hemostasis, there's clearly been a number of indications where the DOACs were unsuccessful compared to warfarin for both efficacy and safety, potentially speaking to different underlying mechanisms for thrombosis and a different indication as I'm thinking about [ESS] I'm thinking about mechanical heart valves. Given what you know about Factor XI biology and the intrinsic pathway nature of the inhibition, what indications would you actively avoid or be somewhat cautious about taking a Factor XI inhibitor into be it yours or someone else's?\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. So let me just step back for just a moment. The benefit risk of whether its platelet or coagulation factors in terms of clotting is something that's actually very topical in the news. I would just emphasize for years, for probably a decade or more, aspirin has been just everywhere. And recently, people realize the benefit risk one has to be very careful. There's been a major change in the guideline. So that impacts how I think about it. The other sort of thing the impact is, if you look at Factor XI, the fundamental advantage of that is that you can get blockage of the coagulation cascade with, by genetic, very little impact in relationship to adverse effects. And so for me, the critical thing is to prove that as quickly as possible. So, we immediately go, where's the problem, where thrombosis and bleeding is both impacted there. And so, that's why we ran the end stage renal disease. But I could see in the future mechanical devices, one of my favorite sort of things is left ventricular assist device, I think that will continue to need to be monitored in the future. So that's a place where the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis is really high, where we have chosen to be a little bit careful is, for example, broader sort of things such as atrial fibrillation and the risk relationship to stroke because we look at the Factor X as very effective. There are bleeding complications, but to make a safety argument for it, you're talking about a very, very large trial. So, we are racing to places where the benefit risk of thrombosis and clotting and bleeding, where that differential would make something like a Factor XI have the biggest impact.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Louise Chen from Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: I wanted to ask you about your pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. And how you think your more targeted approach will be a competitive advantage versus the one size fits all that we're seeing now? And is there any precedence to what you're doing with V116 and 117? And maybe just lastly, how will you make that message clear to physicians since if everything goes as planned, you'll have several PCVs on the market?\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. First of all, we need to get the data to demonstrate that we have an advantage in the different patient populations. But I think you point out a really important point, which is essentially what we're trying to do is for, lack of a better word, we're -- if you want to call it, precision-targeted vaccinations, right? So the fundamental thing is B114 is adult approved and we're driving towards a pediatric approval for the 15 valent. And so, that will be in the pediatric population. In the V116, where we have a breakthrough designation, we're trying to demonstrate that we can target 85% of the residual serotypes. And I would just sit there and tell you it would be eight unique serotypes in relationship to all the different currently approved ones. And I think that patient population, I reflect a little bit about COVID, but it's that older population that especially has the risk factors who you really want to make sure that, that whole population, that adult population is covered. And so, I do think the fundamental thing is we'll have to have the data, but our concept is the adult have a different set of serotypes and they need to be protected, and we'll have to get the data to demonstrate that. But I think if we can demonstrate it, the uptake will be quite good.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nMara Goldstein: I'm just hoping maybe we can return for a second back to the question of novel targets in combination with KEYTRUDA. And maybe if you could just give us a very high level, perhaps rationale for which targets you're looking at and which indications, and I'm referring here, obviously, two things like TIGIT, LAG-3, ILT3 and the like?\nDr. Dean Li: All right. So, let me just sort of separate. So we always talk about expand, deepen and extend. And when we talk about deepen, we're trying to get a deeper response with PD-1s. And there's a series of things that we do with what I call non-I-O agents, which is chemotherapy, we're doing stuff with many other people as well as ourselves with ADCs. There are RAS programs that are advancing. So, we think that sort of combination, there's large precedents throughout our portfolio already, and there will continue to be. And that's also true with Lenvima and Lynparza. The specific question I think you're driving to is combinations of I-O with I-O agents and LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT. So at least in our mind, we do recognize that there was demonstration of LAG-3 adding to PD-1 in melanoma. And I think that's an important signal for us. Where we focused our efforts to LAG-3 is in MSS CRC. So we know that PD-1s work in MSI high, and no one's really been able to crack MFS CRC. So, that's very important and also in classic Hodgkin. I would say, in relationships with CTLA-4, there was recent data with HCC. I would make a comment that I think would make some of the people from Merck smile a little bit, we were the ones who actually did the study with PD-1 and CTLA-4 in relationship to lung. And we could not show a clear contribution of component of CTLA-4 over PD-1. So, that is not a place that we think is an important place for patients, and that is not a place that we're going because we have -- we did this study to demonstrate that. Where we think there could be is, clearly, other people have recently released HDC. We're focused in, for example, in renal cell carcinoma. And then PD-1 and TIGIT, our initial focus is in non-small cell lung cancer and also small cell lung. And we're advancing a series of trials in that. So, I hope that gave a comprehensive view of LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT in relationship to ILT4, other checkpoint inhibitors, such as CD27 or in relationship to cytokines. I think the data that we're doing in earlier stages will have to play out for us to be able to answer that more completely.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Mara. I think we have time for one more question, and then Rob will have a few closing comments.\nOperator: Thank you. Last question comes from the line of Colin Bristow from UBS. Your line is open.\nColin Bristow: Congrats on the quarter. And I also wanted to say all the best of Roy. It's been really great working with you and also congrats to Eliav. So, I just wanted to piggyback on a GARDASIL question. Could you maybe just give us a little more detail on how you expect the GARDASIL supply to increase? And then maybe just help us think through what is the supply-demand mismatch right now? Some of your prior comments suggested that there may not be such, but I know you said supply has been an issue over the past sort of couple of years. So would love to get to expanded thoughts there.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question. This is Caroline. So let me start first with the supply, demand. There is significant demand for GARDASIL. This cancer-preventing vaccine in the HPV area has only reached today 9% of the global eligible population. So, there is significant runway ahead of us to protect lives and to drive growth for Merck. Indeed, we've stated that we expect the revenue in year 2030 to be double the $5.7 billion we achieved in 2021. So, we have significant opportunity ahead of us. In order to achieve that opportunity, we are building new facilities that will be coming online from 2023, 2024 and 2025. So we're going to have a step-up in the level of supply to the market that will happen over that period. Specific then to this year, we will see a continuation of the supply into the market as we did in 2021, albeit not quite at the same step-up that we achieved in 2021. So, we remain really confident in our ability to drive strong growth for GARDASIL both in 2022 and the years to come.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Colin. Rob?\nRob Davis: Well, just let me say thank you for your time and your interest today. And I'd just like to conclude by again thanking the Merck team globally for their focus and commitment and really in driving the results you've heard about today, but continuing to ensure when we keep the purpose of the Company front and center, which is to deliver for patients. Hopefully, you get the sense, we are very confident in the business momentum we have. And I'd like to say as well we are feeling better and better about the evolution of our pipeline and things you've heard today, we're starting to expand. We're doing all of the things we need to do. We have more to do, but we're making great progress. And that's why I have such confidence in the sustainability of our business long term. So, we look forward to continuing to share these results with you to deliver for the patients that count on us and in turn bring value to the shareholders. So with that, I'd say thank you and have a great day.",

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we have had a very strong start to 2022 with exceptional performance in both revenues and earnings. These results further demonstrate that our focus on science and innovation at the core of our strategy, enabled by excellent execution of our dedicated colleagues across the globe, is delivering value for patients, customers and investors. Total company revenues were $15.9 billion, an increase of 50%. LAGEVRIO contributed $3.2 billion in revenue. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the base business delivered very strong growth of 19%. The remainder of my comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, the human health business grew 21% driven primarily by our key pillars as well as the reduced impact of the pandemic. Our Animal Health business also delivered above-market performance with sales increasing 9% driven by growth across both companion animals and livestock segments. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 27% to $4.8 billion, reflecting continued robust global demand and the expansion into new indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to demonstrate strong growth across all key tumors and is benefiting from recent launches in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. KEYTRUDA is currently approved to treat five indications in earlier stage cancers, and we are excited about the potential opportunity to expand into adjuvant lung cancer based on the encouraging data from KEYNOTE-091. We continue to be confident that KEYTRUDA's robust clinical data, combined with physicians' familiarity and experience with the product, will support expanded use and patient benefit in early-stage disease. In the metastatic setting, KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership position in non-small cell lung cancer, capturing 8 out of 10 eligible new patients. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA's growth continues to be driven by lung cancer and the ongoing launches in head and neck cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Our alliance revenue grew 20%, driven by uptake in metastatic breast cancer. We are also excited by the expanded opportunity in early stage breast cancer, following the recent FDA approval based on the OlympiA study. Further, we look forward to potentially reaching a broad prostate population based on the PROPEL study. Lenvima alliance revenue also had very strong growth driven by uptake following the launches of KEYNOTE-581 in advanced renal cell carcinoma and KEYNOTE-775 in metastatic endometrial cancer, where we are seeing encouraging new patient share trends across each of these tumor types. Lenvima growth also benefited from increased demand in hepatocellular carcinoma in China and certain onetime items. We are also excited by the launch of WELIREG for patients with certain VHL-associated tumors. WELIREG continues to generate strong interest among scientific leaders, providers and patients. Although still early in its launch, WELIREG has had strong uptake, providing a treatment option to the significant unmet need for these patients. We are working to potentially extend its reach to broader RCC indications in the future. Our vaccines portfolio again delivered excellent performance led by GARDASIL, which increased 60% to $1.5 billion. Outside the U.S., significant growth was driven by strong underlying demand across key geographies and particularly in China as well as increased supply. In the U.S., sales increased due to the timing of CDC practices. Global demand for GARDASIL remains robust support strong clinical and real-world data as well as efforts to increase the recognition of GARDASIL as a vaccine that can help prevent certain HPV-related cancers in both females and males. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 20%, driven by the ongoing recovery in surgical procedures during the quarter and continued strong leadership of the neuromuscular blockade reversal agent class. Our Animal Health business delivered another quarter of robust growth, with sales increasing 9%. Companion animal sales increased 13%, driven by global demand in parasiticides, including the BRAVECTO line of products as well as vaccines. Livestock sales increased 7% due to higher demand in ruminant and poultry. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 70.7%, a decrease of 5.9 percentage points, driven primarily by higher LAGEVRIO sales. As a reminder, we share profits from LAGEVRIO equally with our partner Ridgeback, which is reflected within cost of sales and reduces our gross margin percentage. Gross margin this quarter also reflects favorable impact of product mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Operating expenses increased 7% to $4.8 billion as we continue to prudently invest behind our growth drivers and pipeline. Other expense was approximately $140 million. Our tax rate was 14%. Taken together, we earned $2.14 per share. Turning now to our 2022 non-GAAP guidance. As a reminder, at the request of the SEC, certain companies in our industry, including ours, have made changes to non-GAAP reporting. We will no longer exclude significant expenses for upfront and milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements as well as transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions from non-GAAP results. As a result, $1.7 billion of R&D charges primarily related to the acquisition of Pandion are now included in our recast 2021 non-GAAP results. This increased R&D expense by $1.7 billion and decreased non-GAAP EPS by $0.65. There was no impact to the first quarters of 2021 and 2022. Our 2022 guidance does not assume any significant transactions that would have previously been excluded from non-GAAP. So this could change in future quarters if we execute business development which is a strategic priority. The underlying strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $56.9 billion and $58.1 billion, representing growth of 17% to 19% or 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and the impact from foreign exchange. The projected impact from foreign exchange includes an incremental headwind of approximately $200 million using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact of just over 2%. We are increasing our gross margin expectation to between 74% and 74.5%. We expect operating expenses of $20.3 billion to $21.3 billion. At the midpoint, this is consistent with what was implied by our prior guidance. We expect other expense of approximately $350 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 13.5% and 14.5% due to an increase in estimated U.S. taxes to be paid on foreign income. We assume 2.53 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we have increased our expected EPS range to $7.24 to $7.36, representing pull-through of the operational strength from our key pillars and operating expense leverage, offset in part by a slight reduction in the top end of our LAGEVRIO sales assumption, the increase in our tax rate and an incremental 1% headwind from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. As you consider your models, there are a few areas to focus on. First, on LAGEVRIO, we are narrowing the range of our full year guidance to $5 billion to $5.5 billion. We have entered into supply and purchase agreements for approximately 10 million courses of therapy. Since authorization, we delivered 6.4 million courses of therapy, including 5 million in the first quarter. We expect approximately half of the remaining full year revenue from LAGEVRIO in the second quarter. We continue to expect strong annual growth for GARDASIL, especially in ex-U.S. markets, including China. Finally, as a reminder, our other revenue line contains several items, including supply sales to Organon, which we began recording upon the completion of the spin-off last year and to Johnson & Johnson for its COVID vaccine. Also included are our revenue hedge and royalties. Other revenue in the first quarter also benefited from approximately $100 million in receipts relating to out-licensing agreement. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. First, we will continue to prioritize investments in our business and pipeline to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to be appropriately aggressive in augmenting our internal pipeline through strategic business development, and we intend to pursue additional value-enhancing opportunities. We remain committed to the dividend with the goal of increasing it over time. To the extent, we have excess cash, we will return it to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we remain very confident in the growth of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and our shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Carter, this is Caroline. Thank you very much for the question. GARDASIL continues to be a great growth driver for our company globally, including China. Specific to China, we saw strong performance in the quarter, and we expect continued strong performance as we go through this year. We have significant demand in China. And as they're off flares, as a result of COVID and potentially lockdown in one part of the country, we have the ability to ensure that we're supplying more of the GARDASIL doses to other parts of the country. So we're, therefore, not anticipating a significant impact to our GARDASIL performance in China as a result of what we're seeing in Shanghai at this moment in time. As it pertains to our supply chain, our company has a very robust supply chain. And we have Plan A and Plan B, if there are any interruptions in the supply chain. So we, again, have no concern for the reliability of our supply chain, but we remain vigilant and focused on the situation at hand. So to Rob's point, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have for adjuvant and the impact that, that has on patients. We initially shared that we expected 50% of our growth to come from adjuvant, representing 30% of the U.S. business. We have now extended that to say 50% of the growth will come from adjuvant, representing 25% of our global business in the year 2025. And to Rob's point, our early introductions into the earlier-stage cancers with five indications now in KEYTRUDA are putting us on a very good course to have this impact. So Umer, thanks for the question. First, let me start. We're proud of molnupiravir, LAGEVRIO and the impact that it can have on the world. And it has impact to the comments that Dean made given its importance, especially in patients that have drug-to-drug interactions. The data that we have access to suggest that we have actually had utilization by 500,000 patients globally at this stage. We have shipped 6.4 million courses as of now. Both shipments represent expectations for utilization over a period of time. And we're actually seeing extremely strong utilization, especially in ex-U.S. markets, where the statistics you quote are actually reversed in some of the markets. We have a very strong market share. So as we sit here today, we've guided on the $5 million to $5.5 billion based on the contracts that we have in hand, and we are confident in that in our financials. Thank you for the question. This is Caroline. So let me start first with the supply, demand. There is significant demand for GARDASIL. This cancer-preventing vaccine in the HPV area has only reached today 9% of the global eligible population. So, there is significant runway ahead of us to protect lives and to drive growth for Merck. Indeed, we've stated that we expect the revenue in year 2030 to be double the $5.7 billion we achieved in 2021. So, we have significant opportunity ahead of us. In order to achieve that opportunity, we are building new facilities that will be coming online from 2023, 2024 and 2025. So we're going to have a step-up in the level of supply to the market that will happen over that period. Specific then to this year, we will see a continuation of the supply into the market as we did in 2021, albeit not quite at the same step-up that we achieved in 2021. So, we remain really confident in our ability to drive strong growth for GARDASIL both in 2022 and the years to come."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. Before I get started, let me take a moment to speak about the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. We're hopeful for an immediate and peaceful resolution to the Russian and Basin of the country, and we support the Ukrainian people and stand with them, and recognize what a terrible tragedy this represents. Merck is making every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and to ensure essential medicines and vaccines continue to reach patients. In addition, we are dedicating meaningful resources to address the humanitarian crisis in the country through multiple channels. Turning to our business. We continue to deliver across our key strategic priorities in the first quarter. We're sustaining the strong business momentum we delivered in 2021 with robust top and bottom line growth. We've also achieved significant clinical advancements across our research pipeline and successfully integrated Acceleron. Now moving to our results. We've had a strong start to 2022, achieving very strong top and bottom line growth. Commercially, we continue to execute well across a broad set of key growth drivers most notably, KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL and Animal Health. Our performance reflects robust underlying demand for our derisked innovative portfolio and reinforces the importance of our science-led strategy. LAGEVRIO, our COVID-19 antiviral treatment, was a significant contributor as well. But even excluding these sales, our top line growth was still overtly 19% versus last year. On LAGEVRIO, we've accelerated broad global access, and it's now established as an important tool for patients and health care providers to address the ongoing pandemic. Since receiving emergency use authorization in December, we've delivered approximately 6.4 million courses to more than 30 countries. The success we are achieving is reflected in our updated 2022 guidance, which demonstrates our expectation for another year of strong growth and overall business momentum. Our oncology business is benefiting from the continued rollout of new and important indications, including in earlier lines of therapy. Global demand for GARDASIL remains strong and growth will benefit from increased supply as a result of the significant investments we are making to expand manufacturing capacity, and our Animal Health business remains positioned to grow at above market rates. Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion through 2025. We're preparing for the post KEYTRUDA LOE period by continuing to strengthen the levers we have and building upon them in order to deliver long-term growth. In oncology, we remain committed to building on the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA and we aim to expand our presence in this key therapeutic area and to establish an enduring leadership position. In addition, we'll continue to maximize the opportunities we see for our durable growth drivers, such as GARDASIL, our pneumococcal portfolio and Animal Health through our proven commercial execution. Beyond our existing portfolio, business development remains a key priority. We remain highly focused in our pursuit of the best external innovation and will be appropriately aggressive when great science and value align. We have a strong track record of business development, but we know we need to do more. And we believe we are well positioned to quickly deploy capital towards the right strategic assets as they present themselves. And finally, we'll continue to advance our broad pipeline across key therapeutic areas in order to deliver medically important innovations to patients. We've taken important steps to provide increased transparency into the opportunities we see in our portfolio and our business, including through two recent investor events. Earlier this month, we provided a detailed description of our growing cardiovascular portfolio and pipeline. And Merck, we're focusing our efforts where the needs are greatest and where we have the best opportunity to positively impact patients' lives, including in heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, thrombosis and atherosclerosis. We've made significant advancements across our CV pipeline and believe our broad differentiated portfolio can have meaningful impacts on patients' lives with at least eight potential new approvals by 2030. We're confident that these important innovations have the potential to be meaningful growth drivers for Merck well into the next decade. And in February, we hosted our inaugural ESG event which highlighted our activities in our four priority areas of access to health, employees, environmental sustainability and ethics and values. Our ESG efforts are grounded in our company's values and we look forward to building on Merck's legacy of operating responsibly going forward. Before I close, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Dr. Roy Baynes, who has announced his retirement after eight years at Merck. Roy has been instrumental in helping Merck become a leading oncology company, particularly through his leadership in the development of KEYTRUDA. We wish Roy the best in his future endeavors and we're confident that he leaves behind an outstanding team and program. I'm pleased to report that Dr. Eliav Barr was appointed to succeed Roy. Eliav not only has deep experience having served in several research capacities throughout his more than two decades at Merck, but also has an unwavering commitment to patients consistent with Merck's purpose to save and improve lives. In summary, we've begun 2022 with strong operational momentum, and I want to express my sincere thanks to our employees worldwide for their continued folk commitment. We remain confident in our fundamental strategy, our growth prospects and in our ability to deliver significant benefits for patients and value to shareholders well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Great. Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, on the BD landscape question, the short answer is we are not seeing a fundamental shift in seller expectations as of this point. I think as time continues, if we see the market reset to become more permanent and more importantly, if the IPO market continues to be challenged for biotech companies, that might change over time as companies become more cash constrained. There are some smaller players that do have cash challenges. So I think that's where you could see movement first. But fundamentally, we've not seen a change in the landscape yet. We'll have to continue to watch. With regards to the Animal Health business, our view continues to be that the Animal Health business, as you said, is core to the Company. It's core to our strategy as part of a growth driver for the Company. But as we've always said, we look at this regularly. We always are challenging ourselves to ask, what is the long-term value creation opportunity of this business in our hands relative to what would be outside of the Company? And on a long-term view, we continue to believe it is best in our hands as part of the Company. But if that situation evolves, we obviously will continue to be objective in how we analyze that. But we do not look at the short-term the arbitrage opportunity for us. It's more about the long-term value creation, and that has not changed as of now. Yes. So Chris, this is Rob. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question then Caroline can jump in for the second part. On the strength of the growth we're seeing in the United States, this is really a testament to what we've been talking about all along, which is as we continue to roll out new indications, we are continuing to see our share grow as the leading I-O agent. And importantly, I would highlight that the growth we saw among other things in the quarter, continuation of our position in renal cell carcinoma, continuation of the growth we're seeing in head and neck. In RCC, obviously, being a first-line treatment in the metastatic setting as well as now having adjuvant therapy as well, we've covered pretty much the waterfront of RCC, and we have the opportunity to continue to grow there. But the standout frankly, for the quarter, and it's, I think, really important to understand is triple-negative breast cancer, both in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant setting. We are seeing incredible growth in that space and it's something that we feel very proud of because I think we're going to have a meaningful difference there. The reason I highlight that is both -- if you look at the adjuvant opportunity there and the growth we're getting as well, as I mentioned, in adjuvant RCC, I think it just reinforces what we see as the future, which is the growth contribution from the earlier lines of therapy long term. But with that, maybe Caroline can be specific to some of the guidance we've provided. Yes. I'll let Caroline maybe address this. Well, just let me say thank you for your time and your interest today. And I'd just like to conclude by again thanking the Merck team globally for their focus and commitment and really in driving the results you've heard about today, but continuing to ensure when we keep the purpose of the Company front and center, which is to deliver for patients. Hopefully, you get the sense, we are very confident in the business momentum we have. And I'd like to say as well we are feeling better and better about the evolution of our pipeline and things you've heard today, we're starting to expand. We're doing all of the things we need to do. We have more to do, but we're making great progress. And that's why I have such confidence in the sustainability of our business long term. So, we look forward to continuing to share these results with you to deliver for the patients that count on us and in turn bring value to the shareholders. So with that, I'd say thank you and have a great day."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dr. Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. It is good to be here to provide an update on our progress. In the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate progress in our pipeline. We made advances across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology in both advanced and earlier stages of cancer as well as in cardiovascular disease and vaccines. I will also provide an update on LAGEVRIO. In oncology, we continue to build upon our strong position and execute on our strategy to expand, deepen and extend benefits to patients and diversify our imprint on cancer. This past quarter, we achieved milestones from several tumor types as well as different stages of disease. Notably, we continue to expand our treatment impact in earlier stages of disease where we now have six approvals from the FDA, five for KEYTRUDA and one for Lynparza. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Virtual plenary session last month, data from the KEYNOTE-091 or PEARL trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage Ib to IIIa non-small cell lung cancer following surgical resection were presented. At an interim analysis, KEYTRUDA has significantly improved disease-free survival in all comers, one of the study's dual primary endpoint. The trial will continue to analyze the other dual primary endpoint of disease-free survival in patients whose tumors express high levels of PD-L1, which did not meet statistical significance at the time of the planned interim analysis. These latest data provide a strong signal for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant treatment study. Additional ongoing studies in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer include KEYNOTE-671, which is evaluating neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy for patients with resectable 2, 3A and 3B disease; KEYNOTE-867, which is studying stereotactic body radiotherapy with or without KEYTRUDA in adults with unreflected Stage 1 HER2 disease, and PLN12 where we are studying KEYTRUDA in combination with Lynparza in Stage 3 disease. Following the approval of KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma following complete resection based on KEYNOTE-716, we announced that at a prespecified interim analysis, the study also met its secondary endpoint of distinct metastasis-free survival and showed continued improvement in recurrent free survival compared to placebo. The data from KEYNOTE-716 reinforces the evidence for KEYTRUDA as adjuvant therapy for appropriate patients with Stage IIB and IIC following surgery that help prevent recurrence of disease. Now similarly, in the earlier-stage setting, along with AstraZeneca, we announced Lynparza was approved by the FDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with germline BRCA patients with HER2-negative high-risk early breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy either before or after surgery based on the OlympiA study. Further, in women's cancer, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with microsatellite instability high, or mismatch repair deficient advanced endometrial carcinoma based on new data for KEYNOTE-158. Now this approval is a fourth gynecologic cancer approval for KEYTRUDA and marks the fifth approval derived from the KEYNOTE-158 trial, an innovative trial designed to evaluate the use of predictive tumor biomarkers in patients receiving KEYTRUDA for advanced solid tumors. Next, the prostate cancer. Along with AstraZeneca, positive results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancer Symposium for the PROPEL trial evaluating Lynparza in combination with abiraterone as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic casted resistant prostate cancer with and without mutations and a group of homologous recombination repair gene. At a planned interim analysis, results showed an improvement in radiographic progression-free survival versus the standard of care. These early results also showed a trend towards improved overall survival. The trial will continue to assess these key secondary endpoints when we plan to engage with health authorities to discuss the findings with the aim of bringing this important option to appropriate patients. Prostate cancer represents a significant unmet need, and we are continually gaining important insights into the biology of the tumor. We are keen on making an impact for patients with late-stage disease. Last month, we announced the discontinuation of the KEYLYNK-010 study, evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and Lynparza for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer. At an interim analysis, this study showed no evidence of superiority to abiraterone enzalutamide with respect to overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival. Our attention in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer now shifts to KEYNOTE-921, a study exploring the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy, and KEYNOTE-641, which is evaluating the combination of KEYTRUDA and enzalutamide. Outside of the United States, we continue to deliver on our regulatory strategy. Notable actions include positive CHMP opinions for cervical, MSI high and early stage breast cancer in Europe and approvals for the combination regimen of KEYTRUDA plus Lenvima for advanced renal cell carcinoma in Japan. And finally, to coincide with ASCO, in early June, we are planning to host an investor event in Chicago. At our recent cardiovascular investor event, we showcased our growing portfolio of programs targeting a range of conditions, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension and thrombosis. Following the completion of our acquisition of Acceleron Pharma, we are making strong progress in advancing the development of sotatercept, a potential first-in-class valuable activin receptor type 2A fusion protein. We recently completed enrollment for the STELLAR trial ahead of schedule. STELLAR is the first of four ongoing Phase III studies evaluating sotatercept. This progress reflects enthusiasm from investigators regarding this novel investigational mechanism. For the first time, the 2022 American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology and Heart Failure Society of America, guideline for the management of heart failure included Verquvo, which we collaborate on with our partner, Bayer, as a Class IIB recommendation for the treatment of Stage C heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The guideline highlights this mechanism of sGC such as Verquvo and the potential benefits of stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP. Based on evidence from the pioneering VICTORIA trial, Verquvo is the first drug specifically studied and approved for patients with worsening heart failure and the only drug recommended in the new guidelines for these patients. Our ongoing VICTOR study is designed to expand on the evidence to date by evaluating Verquvo in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction who have not experienced a recent worsening heart failure events. Merck is uniquely positioned to meaningfully impact the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease with at least eight potential approvals by 2030, including Verquvo and stable heart failure and sotatercept as well as our pipeline of candidates, including an entailed soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, a Factor XI inhibitor and an oral PCSK9 inhibitor. Next, the COVID-19 and LAGEVRIO. As the pandemic evolve, there continues to be regional surges in infection rates with the emergence of new COVID-19 variance. Now some of these strains are resistant to specific monoclonal antibody regimens and appear able to evade some vaccine protection, highlighting the importance of testing and the availability of antiviral option. At the recent European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, we presented Phase III virology outcomes data for move out, adding to the growing body of evidence for the antiviral properties of LAGEVRIO. The panoramic trial evaluating novel antivirals for early treatment, which is being sponsored by the University of Oxford and funded by the U.K. government and the MOVe-AHEAD trial evaluating LAGEVRIO for post-exposure prophylaxis are both ongoing. We are working collaboratively with the European Medicines Agency to provide additional data from these trials in order to secure an approval. We remain confident in the safety and efficacy of LAGEVRIO in appropriate patients. In particular, we believe it's low propensity for drug-drug interactions makes it an important option for patients. Next, on our pneumococcal program. Earlier this month, the FDA extended the PDUFA date for the supplemental biologics license application for VAXNEUVANCE, our 15-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants and children to July 1, 2022. The agency requested additional analyses of data, which we provided. Importantly, no new studies were requested. Also in our new pneumococcal program, we received breakthrough therapy designation for V116, our investigational PCV that is designed to target serotypes responsible for approximately 80% of the residual invasive disease in the older adult population and includes eight unique serotypes not in currently licensed vaccine. We look forward to providing deeper updates. In closing, I would like to thank Roy Baynes for his many contributions to Merck over the past eight years. As we build upon his legacy, I'm constantly reminded of wisdom and teaching and I'm grateful to work with a remarkable team he has trained and mentored. One of those mentees, of course, is Eliav Barr. Eliav's experience commitment to Merck's purpose of saving and improving lives makes him the ideal leader of our global clinical development program. Eliav has a wealth of experience, holding leadership roles across an array of therapeutic areas during his 27 years at Merck, including vaccine, infectious disease, and oncology. I look forward to continuing to partner with Eliav to build upon Merck's legacy of innovation and breakthrough size. And now back to Peter. Thank you for that question. So I just wanted to emphasize the question focuses on the addition of another checkpoint inhibitor TIGIT on top of PD-1. And this is a strategy to sort of deepen the response of PD-1 and PD-L1. I think it will be very important to see that data and look at the contribution of components. And really, we're -- we have a TIGIT program that we're also advancing in non-small cell lung cancer and small lung cancer. So, the field will have to sort of see as the data evolves, how much does TIGIT add to PD-1 in the lung space. But I do want to make a broader sort of comment, which is you'll see movements in TIGIT that was recently movement in PD-1, and CPLA4 and PD-1 and LAG-3. What you recognize as each of those combinations, what they do is if you're able to show a benefit of the additional agent, it doesn't have as broad of an impact as PD-1 has in many different tumors. And so, one of the things that I think is important to highlight is our strategy is not to just be invested in LAG-3, not to be just invested in CPLA4, not be just invested in TIGIT, but to be invested in all three and to focus them in specific tumor types. Yes. So thank you so much for that question in relationship to sotatercept. So just to reemphasize, we have three different trials, all driving towards somewhat different outcomes, the six-minute walk, which is the STELLAR trial. There's also time to clinical worsening, and then there's also even harder outcomes past that. And as you point out, each one of those is sort of ratcheting up what sotatercept can do. In relationship to the first one, which is STELLAR, which is related to what you said, the six-minute walk test, where we saw actually quite impressive data and relationships to the Phase II, we have very committed patient groups as well as sites who are very well trained in how to do these trials. And the Phase II was really nice data. And the fundamental issue is that we are confident that many of those same sites that were involved with the Phase II are involved with Phase III. So I think we're confident we'll see what that data is. But the best predictor of how well we can manage those trials is really the best indicator is the Phase II, and we're using very many sites and the investigators. So, we have great confidence in that. Yes, thank you very much for that question. In relationship to sort of just earlier stage in lung cancer, I think it's really important to emphasize there's a series of different ways to approach it. One is neoadjuvant, adjuvant. One is adjuvant. And I just think all of these signals just demonstrate throughout a variety of different studies just the impact that PD-1s can have. So our point of view of it is it shouldn't change our strategy. It should just make our strategy pretty comprehensive. The fundamental thing is we have KEYNOTE-091, which is in the adjuvant, so that's post-surgery, and that's usually given by a medical oncologist, the disease-free survival was positive in all comers regardless of PD-L1. There was a trend to TPS greater than 50%, but not statistically significant. And OS, it was a favorable trend regardless of PD-L1. So we'll be letting that data mature as we continue to discuss with the FDA. But going -- to your point, it's not just KEYNOTE-091. It's KEYNOTE-671. It's KEYNOTE-867. It's KEYLYNK-012. It's all in the earlier stage. So our desire to really push that earlier stage is going to be -- if anything, our commitment towards that is even greater. The one thing I would just add in relationship to some of the comments that Caroline and Rob made is that I think it's very important to think about melanoma renal cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer, where at least my experience being in the hospital, there's a concept of really looking at that earlier stage. And I think uptake may be sort of built in the medical system. I think all of us, including us and other companies as well as patient advocacies and medical centers are going to have to require diligent investment to really, really maximize the important scientific impacts of KEYTRUDA and PD-1s and PD-L1s in the early lung space. Yes. So let me just step back for just a moment. The benefit risk of whether its platelet or coagulation factors in terms of clotting is something that's actually very topical in the news. I would just emphasize for years, for probably a decade or more, aspirin has been just everywhere. And recently, people realize the benefit risk one has to be very careful. There's been a major change in the guideline. So that impacts how I think about it. The other sort of thing the impact is, if you look at Factor XI, the fundamental advantage of that is that you can get blockage of the coagulation cascade with, by genetic, very little impact in relationship to adverse effects. And so for me, the critical thing is to prove that as quickly as possible. So, we immediately go, where's the problem, where thrombosis and bleeding is both impacted there. And so, that's why we ran the end stage renal disease. But I could see in the future mechanical devices, one of my favorite sort of things is left ventricular assist device, I think that will continue to need to be monitored in the future. So that's a place where the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis is really high, where we have chosen to be a little bit careful is, for example, broader sort of things such as atrial fibrillation and the risk relationship to stroke because we look at the Factor X as very effective. There are bleeding complications, but to make a safety argument for it, you're talking about a very, very large trial. So, we are racing to places where the benefit risk of thrombosis and clotting and bleeding, where that differential would make something like a Factor XI have the biggest impact. Yes. First of all, we need to get the data to demonstrate that we have an advantage in the different patient populations. But I think you point out a really important point, which is essentially what we're trying to do is for, lack of a better word, we're -- if you want to call it, precision-targeted vaccinations, right? So the fundamental thing is B114 is adult approved and we're driving towards a pediatric approval for the 15 valent. And so, that will be in the pediatric population. In the V116, where we have a breakthrough designation, we're trying to demonstrate that we can target 85% of the residual serotypes. And I would just sit there and tell you it would be eight unique serotypes in relationship to all the different currently approved ones. And I think that patient population, I reflect a little bit about COVID, but it's that older population that especially has the risk factors who you really want to make sure that, that whole population, that adult population is covered. And so, I do think the fundamental thing is we'll have to have the data, but our concept is the adult have a different set of serotypes and they need to be protected, and we'll have to get the data to demonstrate that. But I think if we can demonstrate it, the uptake will be quite good. All right. So, let me just sort of separate. So we always talk about expand, deepen and extend. And when we talk about deepen, we're trying to get a deeper response with PD-1s. And there's a series of things that we do with what I call non-I-O agents, which is chemotherapy, we're doing stuff with many other people as well as ourselves with ADCs. There are RAS programs that are advancing. So, we think that sort of combination, there's large precedents throughout our portfolio already, and there will continue to be. And that's also true with Lenvima and Lynparza. The specific question I think you're driving to is combinations of I-O with I-O agents and LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT. So at least in our mind, we do recognize that there was demonstration of LAG-3 adding to PD-1 in melanoma. And I think that's an important signal for us. Where we focused our efforts to LAG-3 is in MSS CRC. So we know that PD-1s work in MSI high, and no one's really been able to crack MFS CRC. So, that's very important and also in classic Hodgkin. I would say, in relationships with CTLA-4, there was recent data with HCC. I would make a comment that I think would make some of the people from Merck smile a little bit, we were the ones who actually did the study with PD-1 and CTLA-4 in relationship to lung. And we could not show a clear contribution of component of CTLA-4 over PD-1. So, that is not a place that we think is an important place for patients, and that is not a place that we're going because we have -- we did this study to demonstrate that. Where we think there could be is, clearly, other people have recently released HDC. We're focused in, for example, in renal cell carcinoma. And then PD-1 and TIGIT, our initial focus is in non-small cell lung cancer and also small cell lung. And we're advancing a series of trials in that. So, I hope that gave a comprehensive view of LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIGIT in relationship to ILT4, other checkpoint inhibitors, such as CD27 or in relationship to cytokines. I think the data that we're doing in earlier stages will have to play out for us to be able to answer that more completely."

These slides, along with the earnings release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and our SEC filings, are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. 2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we have made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone. Over half of which were through donations. We also made substantial investments in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover and bring forward to patients the next generation of impactful innovations, over $30 billion in total, including the cost of certain acquisitions and collaborations. As we move forward, I am confident that our strong momentum will continue, underpinned by the unwavering dedication of our talented global team. We are realizing the benefits of our sustained focus on key strategic priorities. The excellence of our commercial and operational execution enables us to deliver tangible value in the short-term while we invest in new innovations and strengthen our pipeline for the long-term. In 2023, we advanced important clinical programs and augmented our pipeline with promising business development, such as the acquisition of Prometheus and our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Guided by our science-led strategy, I am confident that the focused and disciplined business decisions we make and the actions we take will lead to sustainable benefits for the patients we serve and long-term growth and value for our shareholders. Turning to our results and initial outlook for 2024, we delivered excellent underlying growth in 2023, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. I am pleased to share that we expect continued strong growth in 2024 driven by demand for our key products, which Caroline will speak to momentarily. Turning to the progress we are making in research, we are currently pursuing programs across a more diverse set of therapeutic areas with high unmet need and across more modalities than at any time in recent memory. This year, we will remain keenly focused on advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, which includes two launches that will address critical health needs and have blockbuster commercial opportunity. In cardiometabolic, we are very excited by the anticipated FDA action on our application for sotatercept in the United States, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for many patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our commercial and manufacturing teams are fully prepared for the strong uptake we expect. Sotatercept is an important component of our growing cardiometabolic pipeline, which we believe has significant long-term potential. In vaccines, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for V116. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older. Based on its compelling profile, V116 has the potential to become an important new preventative option for adults and we believe it can achieve majority market share in this setting. We look forward to a potential approval in June. And in oncology, we continue to expand into additional tumor types in earlier stages of certain cancers as well as progress our increasingly broad pipeline of novel candidates. We have achieved substantial diversification with a dramatically expanded set of late-stage programs, which Dean will speak to. I am confident that Merck is well positioned to provide important innovation to patients and sustain its leadership in oncology well into the future. I know Dean and his team are energized by our progress and are prepared to build on the success we have had in 2023 to further advance Merck\u2019s pipeline and bring transformative innovation to patients this year and beyond. In summary, our science-led strategy, which keeps the patient at the center of everything we do, is delivering important advancements and helping us build a sustainable growth engine for our company. We have made considerable progress over the past year in advancing and expanding our pipeline, which has resulted in substantially increased long-term commercial opportunities. We have taken meaningful steps to diversify and position ourselves for sustained leadership in oncology while also building one of our deepest and broadest pipelines across discovery and development in our recent history outside of oncology and notably in cardiometabolic and immunology. Further, we also expect to benefit from promising late-stage programs across our vaccines, neurosciences, HIV and animal health pipelines, a robust set of early phase programs and the potential to add exciting innovation through future science-led business development. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we are well positioned to drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the next decade. I would again like to thank our global teams for their commitment to strong research, commercial and operational execution. With a concerted focus on achieving continued excellence, I am very confident in our ability to deliver short and long-term stakeholder value. I look forward to providing future updates on our progress and impact. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2023 was another impactful year for our company. We delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by robust performance across oncology, vaccines and animal health. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term while making disciplined investments in innovative science, which will drive long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.6 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 13%. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 14% driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% driven by companion animal products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 22% to $6.6 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, with particularly strong growth in international markets due to the more recent launches of these important indications. Growth was also driven by the strong global need of patients with metastatic disease. We continue to be encouraged by the positive impact our recent approvals are having on certain patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. In the U.S., we have made considerable progress in helping to improve drug treatment rates and have further increased our leadership position in the adjuvant setting. We also received positive feedback from healthcare providers following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39 in advanced urothelial cancer. With this approval, KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV is now indicated for first-line advanced urothelial cancer patients regardless of cisplatin eligibility. Based on the outstanding clinical data, we believe this regimen has the potential to transform the standard of care for these patients. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 8% and 5% respectively. WELIREG sales grew 78% to $72 million driven by increased uptake in VHL-associated tumors. We are excited by the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma, following the recent approval based on the LITESPARK-005 study. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 27% to $1.9 billion, driven by global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $176 million driven by ongoing launches in Europe and continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 sales in the U.S. benefited from inventory stocking in preparation for the pediatric launch. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales declined 3%. Increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was more than offset by the impact of generic entrants in international markets, particularly in Europe. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 4%. Companion animal sales grew 12% driven by the BRAVECTO line of products due to strong underlying demand and timing of purchases. Livestock sales were flat, reflecting favorable price actions offset by the timing of ruminant product purchases. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77.2%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points largely due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $11.6 billion, including a $5.5 billion one-time charge related to our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting disciplined investment in support of our expansive early-and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $174 million. Our tax rate was approximately 114%, which reflects the impact of the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, the underlying tax rate was 13.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $0.03, which includes a $1.69 negative impact from the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. We expect another year of strong growth driven by key marketed products and we will begin to benefit from the anticipated launches of impactful new products, such as sotatercept and V116. We project revenue to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 7%. This growth includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. The headwind is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice. Our gross margin assumption is approximately 80.5%, which includes the benefit from reduced royalties paid on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.1 billion and $26.1 billion, which includes an approximate $650 million one-time charge related to the announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.44 to $8.59. This range includes an approximate $0.26 per share charge related to the planned acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is not tax-deductible and the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 using mid-January rates, including the impact from Argentina. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We are excited by the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our innovative pipeline in 2023. In 2024, we will increase this investment, including the initiation of more late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, we enter 2024 with confidence in the outlook for our business in the near and long term. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong, and we are excited about our expansive pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength as a direct result of our longstanding commitment to science in order to improve the lives of the patients we serve. Our continued investment in innovation and excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Today, I will provide notable R&D updates since our last earnings call and a brief summary of 2023 accomplishments. Momentum in the pipeline remains strong. Progress is spanning both early- and late-phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Starting with Oncology, we are diversifying our portfolio and executing on our strategy, which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immunooncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. In immunooncology, we remain committed to the development of KEYTRUDA and further transforming cancer care to address the needs of certain patients. In the fourth quarter, we received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission in two gastrointestinal indications: one in combination with chemotherapy for the first line treatment of adults with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesaphageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-A59; and another in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer based on KEYNOTE-966. As we continue to harness the potential of KEYTRUDA, we have an increased focus on earlier stages of disease, where we believe timely, effective intervention may significantly improve patient outcomes. Last month, we announced FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of fecal Stage 3 through 4A cervical cancer based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial. This is an important advancement and provides a new option that has potential to become the standard of care. To-date, with all the research conducted with checkpoint inhibitors, the only studies that have demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in earlier stage cancers are KEYTRUDA-based regimens: KEYNOTE-671 as part of a neoadjuvant followed by post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-564 as a post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with renal cell carcinoma. Since the approval of a KEYNOTE-671 in October, it is notable that the American Cancer Society released guidance recommending that certain individuals with significant smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan. The guidance also expands the age range for lung cancer screening. We look forward to the opportunity to help impact patients and support the identification of more patients at risk. Additional data from KEYNOTE-564 demonstrating an overall survival benefit were presented at the ASCO GU conference last week. Detailed findings from KEYNOTE-123 evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized, muscle-invasive and locally advanced, resectable urothelial carcinoma demonstrating a disease-free survival benefit versus observation were also presented at ASCO GU. Also in the earlier-stage setting, along with our partner, Moderna, we announced 3-year recurrent-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival data for our individualized neoantigen therapy, V940, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage 3 and 4 melanoma following complete resection. We are encouraged by the durability of the responses observed and the potential for this regimen to impact patients earlier in their diagnosis. The Phase 3 trials in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are actively enrolling. Progress continues in precision oncology. The FDA approval for WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI, marks the first drug approved in a new therapeutic class for eligible patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in nearly a decade and builds on the 2021 approval for the treatment of adults with certain von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. Additional Phase 3 pneumococcal studies for WELIREG, in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib for the treatment of certain types of renal cell carcinoma in the advanced and adjuvant settings, are ongoing. Finally, moving to the tissue targeting space. Together with Astellas and Seagen, now Pfizer, we announced the FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev, a Nectin-4-targeting ADC for the first-line treatment to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from KEYNOTE-A39. These results demonstrated a superior overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin and extend our pioneering work in combining KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy as well as reinforcing the value of an ADC to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor tissue. Following the announcement of our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo in October, we are pleased to receive priority review from the FDA for MK-1022, or patritumab deruxtecan, our investigation of a fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The agency has set a target action date of June 26. Through our agreements with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo as well as our own discovery programs, we have established a robust pipeline of tissue-targeting ADCs. And the recently announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics provides the opportunity to help complement and strengthen our approach by providing a portfolio of novel T cell engagers, the most significant of which is HPN-328, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager being evaluated in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Our strong diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents positions us well to have a profound impact on even more patients long into the future. Next to our Vaccine pipeline. We are making notable advancements with our population-specific vaccine program for pneumococcal disease. The FDA has accepted for priority review the new biologics license application for V116, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, specifically designed for adults supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating V116 in both pneumococcal vaccine-naive and vaccine-experienced adult patient population. Results from STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November and additional data from STRIDE-3 as well as STRIDE studies 4, 5 and 6 will be presented at the International Society of Pneumonia and Pneumococcal Disease Congress in March. If approved, as Rob noted, V116 would be the first new pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in about 65 years of age and older, according to CDC data from 2018 to 2021. Importantly, V116 includes eight unique serotypes, which account for 30% of disease according to the same CDC data. These serotypes are not covered by currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine options. The FDA has set a target action date of June 17. Turning to programs in the cardiometabolic disease pipeline. We are eager to bring sotatercept to patients as an important treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The FDA has set a target action date of March 26. Beyond data from the STELLAR trial, we have the Phase 3 ZENITH and HYPERION studies, which are evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on their disease journey. In addition, the Phase 2 CADENCE trial will evaluate WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension focused on a type of blood clot disease. As we close out 2023, it is important to highlight our significant progress and execution across therapeutic areas and modalities as well as multiple business development transactions. In the year, we have more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets. We also initiated over 20 Phase 3 studies across multiple new classes of assets, including in on oncology with bomedemstat, our LSD1 inhibitor in essential thrombocythemia; nemtabrutinib, our BTK inhibitor in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia of small lymphocytic lymphoma; MK-2870, our TROP2 ADC in collaboration with Kelun in non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial carcinoma; MK-5684, our CYP11A1 inhibitor in collaboration with Orion in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and V940 in collaboration with Moderna for the adjuvant treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; also in immunology, with tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis; finally, in cardiometabolic disease with multiple trials for MK-0616 in hypercholesterolemia. As a result of the increasing depth and breadth of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate an even greater number of Phase 3 trials in 2024. Considerable credit goes to my colleagues across the organization for their hard work and unwavering dedication. We are executing on our science-led strategy and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year. And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Ivy, we\u2019re now ready to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I know there is a trial due for you guys later this year, KEYFORM-007 trial. That\u2019s the LAG-3 with pembrolizumab in colorectal cancer. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the risk profile and the odds of success heading into that and if there is been any interim OS analysis. Thank you very much.\nDean Li: I\u2019ll take this. Umer, thank you very much for that question. I mean just to recognize that in MSI high, we have a strong presence with pembro there. The larger group in CRC or colorectal cancer is in the MSS population. At this point, there is not really been any checkpoint inhibitor that\u2019s shown dramatic impact in MSS CRC. So our interest in driving pembro plus LAG-3 in that is to demonstrate that a checkpoint inhibitor could have a meaningful impact in MSS CRC. If we should get a positive signal in that, clearly, we would use that as a beachhead to expand and extend the role of checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC, which is a place that requires a lot of more innovation. In terms of specific interim analysis on this, we generally try to keep that when there is data that\u2019s worth sharing, that\u2019s when we share it. Thanks.\nRob Davis: Just real quick, just quick microphone check. Can you hear us? \nOperator: No, we can hear you.\nRob Davis: You can? Okay, we were showing we are muted. Sorry.\nOperator: No, you are fine. We can hear you loud and clear.\nRob Davis: Alright. Good.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Next questions please, Ivy?\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTrung Huynh: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So for sotatercept, we noticed the HYPERION study primary completion date has now moved to August 26. It was November 29 on clinicaltrials.gov. That\u2019s 3 years earlier. Just \u2013 could you just let us know the reason for that change? And if I could sneak one in. Just is there a place to transition sotatercept from inpatient clinic administration to self-administration? Thanks very much.\nDean Li: So let me take the first question. So there is a series of trials and relationships with sotatercept. So the March date that we talk about is for a potential decision by the FDA for approval based on the STELLAR trial. And we think in the second half of 2024, we may be in a position in relationship to the EU. We have other trials, as you point out, especially Phase 3 trials, and they are ZENITH and they are HYPERION. Those two are based on events. So it\u2019s a tracking of events that sort of define when those happen. So ZENITH, I think, is now like September 2025 and HYPERION, August 2026. So that\u2019s just been event-driven. In relationship to how best to treat patients, well we\u2019re in conversations with the FDA in relationship to where is the best place for patients to be treated. But I\u2019ll just highlight that we have an image of an auto injector moving very fast through our pipeline. So that might give you a sense of where we think this may end up.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you. Next question please Ivy.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Daina Graybosch from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nDaina Graybosch: Hi, thank you for the question. I have one on Oncology for one of the new assets going into Phase 3, the Orion MK-5684. I wonder if you could talk more about that asset. And what gives you confidence that it will demonstrate broad benefit in prostate cancer, in addition to the patients with the AR-LBD mutations? And can you confirm the stat design of the two Omaha studies will prioritize a hierarchy to statistically look at the mutation segment first?\nDean Li: Yes. So just so that everyone is looking at this asset in the same way, there have been critical medicines that ablate androgen field growth in prostate cancer. And the interest in the SIP is it\u2019s very high upstream, and we think that it could be an important contribution. Clearly, we\u2019re in \u2013 as you point out, we\u2019re interested both broadly, but especially in the specific mutation patients. And so we will be advancing those trials to look at that subpopulation as well as more broad populations. In terms of the statistical sort of analysis in that, that\u2019s something that I think probably would be best sort of discussed with our clinical teams at a different time.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Daina. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Thank you very much for taking the question. Good morning. Maybe following up on the commentary on V116. You talked about a potential to reach a majority market share. What does that sort of imply around the potential ACIP recommendation or the potential for a catch-up opportunity in the adult segment?\nDean Li: Yes. So I\u2019ll just \u2013 so again, we\u2019re talking about V116. We\u2019re talking about FDA potential action in June 2024, followed by ACIP, followed by MMWR. I think it\u2019s in March that we\u2019re going to be presenting STRIDE-3 and 6, and I think the data will be out there. And as you\u2019ll see in that, between STRIDE-3 and throughout STRIDE-3 all the way to 6, you\u2019ll see data in relationship to vaccination of those who are naive versus previously vaccinated. And you will see data in the patient population \u2013 or the population that 65, but also in the 50-plus as well. As that data is digested, both by the FDA, but probably very importantly, by the ACIP, I think those data will guide how the ACIP makes their decision.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Anything else? Okay, next question please, Ivy?\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could expand on some of the nuances of your guidance. Specifically, do you include meaningful revenues from sotatercept or V116? I\u2019m assuming they are for approval at some point this year.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question, Evan. This is Caroline. As we\u2019ve guided for 2024, we\u2019re very confident in the underlying momentum in our business across Oncology, across Vaccines, across Animal Health. We also are very excited about the potential launches for sotatercept and V116. For sotatercept, given the significant clinical data we have and the understanding that there are many patients that have already been identified who can benefit for sotatercept on top of the treatments they have, we are expecting a strong launch. For V116, as Dean just outlined, we will wait for the FDA approval, the ACIP recommendation. We will then expect MMWR to publish, and therefore, expect to have impact with V116 coming towards the end of this year.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Evan. Next question please, Ivy?\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. A competitor recently reported some disappointing data with their TROP2 ADC and later line lung. I recognize these TROP2s are all different given the technology, the linkers. But does this impact at all your development strategy for your TROP2 in lung or perhaps increase the need for a biomarker strategy here? Thank you.\nDean Li: Yes. This is Dean. Thanks for that question. So I\u2019ll just step back, and I think I\u2019ve said this previously, especially in lung, it\u2019s very important to understand what the standard of care is and that one would have to beat it in a significant way. And the standard of care, in our minds, in the late stage, is roughly KEYNOTE-189. And now in the earlier stage, it\u2019s clearly in KEYNOTE-671 both with clear OS data. What we have said previously is that we are unclear that any one ADC can have as broad of an impact as KEYNOTE-189 or 671 and that in order for ADC to have a substantial advantage in those patient populations, one may need to focus on a biomarker-selected patient population. And so the data that we saw does not change our way of thinking. It\u2019s the way of thinking that we\u2019ve discussed previously. And I would just add that it\u2019s really important, there is also data out there where people are doing retrospective biomarker data in this. For us to demonstrate true efficacy in any patient population, we need a biomarker strategy that is prospective and one that can be easily actionable throughout the world. Thanks.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Terence. Next question please, Ivy?\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAdam Jolly: Hi, thank you for taking our question. This is Adam on for Tim. On GARDASIL, a 2-dose regimen was recently approved in China. We\u2019re wondering if that poses a revenue problem. Potentially, it doesn\u2019t, if it just means that more supply gets spread out across more people, and Merck ends up selling just as many doses in total. Can Merck share its perspective here?\nRob Davis: Sure. Adam, thanks for the question. So there has actually been Chinese competitors with an offering for some time actually in the Chinese market. And that market is large. We continue to believe in the eligible cohorts in just the urban females, which was the Tier 1 to Tier 3 cities, is about 200 million \u2013 a little over 200 million women. And so of that, we think probably about 30% have actually received vaccination. So, you are still looking at 120 million, 130 million eligible population. As we look at this and as we have seen over time, we continue to be very competitive. We are maintaining a vast majority of share in the private market. And really, you are seeing most of the local competitors go to the lower-tier cities and to a different population than we have been targeting. So, that does not change our view of the growth potential in China. Long-term, obviously we will continue to face competition there, and we are positioning ourselves to continue to succeed there. But the approval you are talking about is not changing our view.\nCaroline Litchfield: The only add, if I may is we had significant opportunity to protect further females in China. At the end of 2023, we also submitted to the regulatory authorities our data on GARDASIL for males. So, we are hopeful to introduce that in the Chinese market in the future.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks Adam. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. Maybe one question on V116 as well. So, Pfizer has recently made comments around adult market shrinking at this point. So, could you comment on how do you see the peak opportunity for V116 in the context of adult market shrinking and then you are taking share from a shrinking market? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. I will start and then Caroline can jump in as well. But I think as you look at the market size and the comments, I don\u2019t want to speak to comments that others have made. I think it\u2019s also important to understand that as we bring a vaccine which brings significant incremental coverage, at 83% versus, if you look at PCV20, just as an example, it\u2019s closer to, I think about 30%. So, you are looking at significant incremental coverage, which I think it can have an impact on how you think both about catch-up to cover the disease. As Dean noted in his prepared comments, we have eight serotypes covering 30% of what is causing disease, which is unique to us. So, we think that, that will have implications both in terms of the catch-ups as well as potentially to be able to go for patients 50 and plus versus 65 and plus. So, if you take all of those things into account, we still see this as a very large opportunity for us. Our view is it\u2019s about an $8 billion market in \u201823. We anticipate it actually growing to be over $10 billion later in the decade. And with that being the pediatric segment of that is about 70%, so we are looking at 30% of that is what is the adult piece. So, as we see it, this is still a growing market, a good market. And we remain very confident that V116 will both have a majority share and be a meaningful contributor.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks Mohit. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks for the question. Just a bigger-picture question on business development. The company has obviously been very active the past few years. And I am just trying to get a sense of just kind of size and stage of assets that you consider just given the current R&D investments you are making and the asset \u2013 the kind of the amount of capital you are allocating there. So, I guess specifically, are deals along the lines of an Acceleron or a Prometheus still deals that Merck would look at and prioritize, or at this point, should we be thinking about maybe earlier-stage assets that, that would be more of the focus? Thanks so much.\nRob Davis: Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, first, I just want to reinforce the pride I have in what Dean and the team have been able to do and the meaningful progress we are making both in our internal pipeline and what we have been able to do through the business development, which is I think in some ways, in a weird way, underlying your question. But as we sit here today, while I feel very good about the progress we have made in the growing portfolio, the diverse and deep portfolio we have in our pipeline, we do continue to believe we need more, and we will continue to prioritize business development. And I would say that our views of deals like Prometheus, like Acceleron are still the size of deals we are very interested in, if we can find great assets. So, clearly that\u2019s an area of focus. But also continuing to do smaller deals as well, like what you saw with Harpoon. So, it\u2019s going to be a range of deals. But I think as you look in that zero to kind of $15 billion, $1 billion to $15 billion, it continues to be where we will look for. And then obviously, we have also, I think shown that not only are we very open to doing an acquisition, but we see collaboration as an important tool as well, very similar to what we did with Daiichi Sankyo. So, we are going to be looking at the full suite and including deals that fit those categories.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks Chris. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. I was going to ask you about your expectations for the AI \u2013 ACIP recommendation on revaccination of prevent [ph] or vaccinated patients, but I suspect you may not want to share that view. So instead, maybe I could ask you about the first-line TROP2 SKB non-small cell trial that you are running in combination with KEYTRUDA. Some of the recently published academic data suggests that TROP2 internalization is a biomarker in patients who are primary resistant to PD-1. So, it just seems like an old population to be exploring the drug in, assuming that is real and not a fake signal. And I take completely the caveats that it\u2019s retrospective data analysis in other settings. But given that, it would seem to be more sensible to have a combination with chemo and layering on top. And can you do this given the profile of the drug in terms of bone marrow suppression?\nDean Li: Yes. So, I will just answer more broadly in relationship to TROP2 as an ADC and specifically our compound. One of the things that is extremely useful to us is its adverse effect profile, especially for lung cancer patients and relationship to lung toxicity is readily manageable. It\u2019s a quite good profile. In terms of your question about the paper that I think that you talked about internalization and this I think those are interesting and important papers for us to consider. But I think one of the things that\u2019s also important for us to do is to do the clinical experiment and see what the results are in relationship. We are confident that TROP2 ADC will have an impact. TROP2 ADCs in breast cancer has had an impact. And we believe that our TROP2 ADC, especially with the linker and payload, will have an important impact in lung cancer. And then the question that you have is, how do you combine it, do you combine it with chemo, do you combine it with PD-1, how do you think through that, I think those are questions that our clinical team thinks deeply about, but we also think deeply about what line of therapy and also what the standard of care is. And if you want to move to first line standard of care is KEYNOTE-189 with a chemo/pembro basis. So, one has to think about how one would advance a TROP2 from different lines all the way to first line. So, those considerations come in quite heavily.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please Ivy.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks very much for the question and congrats on the quarter and the guidance. Can you just talk a little bit about subcutaneous KEYTRUDA, how you anticipate payers\u2019 acceptance of this new delivery modality as well as potential economic benefits to patients given the shift from Part B to Part D? I think there could be some benefits from the updated catastrophic cap being drivers there. But struggling in the face of potential biosimilars of KEYTRUDA after 2028 to see how payers would treat this, just interested to have a little bit more color on the economic benefits, not just the benefits of the patients of subcutaneous KEYTRUDA. Thanks so much.\nDean Li: So, this is Dean. I will take the first question and then I will hand it over to Rob and Caroline because the economic question and the payer is also related to the innovation that you provide. I just want to make sure that our way of thinking about something like pembro with hyaluronidase given as subcu is really there is going to be a call for that innovation. I will just emphasize, we constantly speak about the earlier-stage cancer. And right now, we have nine approvals. And as I have said in relationship in the prepared remarks, of those approvals, two \u2013 the only two that have checkpoint inhibitors that have OS benefit is KEYTRUDA base, which is early lung cancer and RCC. I actually just came from a meeting speaking to a bunch of thoracic oncologists in this, and it\u2019s quite interesting to hear how they speak for those who are thoracic oncologists, who are linked to setting with medical oncologists, and they very clearly understand why KEYNOTE-671 perioperative is the category one. In situations where you may have a CT surgeon outside of a major care plan or a care \u2013 a major medical center sometimes you have CT surgeons moonlighting doing lobectomies and resection, for that, the KEYNOTE-091. And constantly, what we hear from the physicians and the provider, and many of them are in provider systems of all different types, is the need to have an alternative way to get the KEYTRUDA to them, either Q3, Q6 given the regimen. So, I just want to emphasize that the subcu pembro plus hyaluronidase is an innovation that is going to be demanded and is being demanded by the field.\nRob Davis: Yes. Thanks Dean. And to the questions on the economics, and I think we have commented on this a little bit in various settings. But as we think about our strategy for bringing this to the market from a commercial perspective, our view is the quality-of-life benefits this brings does demonstrate and afford us the ability to get a premium price. But we also are very cognizant that any subcu pembro will have to be considered in the context of a generic IV version. So, we will price our subcu to drive for volume and to do for conversion, which means we will be looking at prices really more in line with where you would see the generic version at a premium that history has shown is very manageable and expected and covered by payers today when you look at the different delivery for them. So, in that sense, we think we will be able to manage this. The whole question of Part B versus Part D, we will have to see how it plays out as far as the ultimate side of administration. But if it does end up being into the Part D category, which is a reasonable chance, you are correct and that some of the new coverages that are out there in catastrophic and with the cap, also then from a patient perspective, should lower the burden they are going to face, which we also think could help with conversion.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Alright. Thanks Seamus. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Caroline, on margins, you highlighted a benefit from KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL this year, which I think was expected. But looking forward, is the guidance this year a reasonable target until the KEYTRUDA LOE? I wasn\u2019t sure if there is other drivers going forward or whether mix could impact margins as well. Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question, Geoff. So, as you all know, our company has made great progress in expanding operating margin over a number of years. As we look to 2024, we expect operating margin to improve. And that\u2019s really driven by the strength of the top line and mix of revenue by the roll-off of royalties that we have noted on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Being disciplined in our expenses, while we do invest fully behind our expansive pipeline, as we go beyond 2024, we still point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in 2025. But our focus as a company and as a team is to really ensure that we are fueling the pipeline supporting the portfolio of products that we are launching to drive growth into the long-term.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks Geoff. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we will go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I believe the Merck RSV monoclonal antibody Phase 2/3 study is registrational and reads out this year, is that correct? And assuming positive, how soon could Merck be on the market? And how might this product be differentiated from by Fortis? It\u2019s just a little odd that this could be a $1 billion opportunity, not that far off, and Merck never talks about it. Thank you.\nDean Li: I really appreciate the question. So, I will talk about it. In relationship to the RSV monoclonal antibody, it\u2019s for the early birth, it\u2019s an antibody, it\u2019s passive immunization, and it\u2019s for the pediatric population. This is a single shot. This is not weight-based. And we believe it has a longer season in relationship to other choices. And so we think it\u2019s an important readout, and we are very excited and interested to move on this RSV monoclonal antibody. I would also emphasize that the New England Journal of Medicine just published a series of papers, not in RSV, but also in dengue that also we are very excited about. And we are moving that forward quickly. And then more broadly from the ID vaccine, I have said previously that I am very intrigued to see the results of our NRTTI islatravir and our other NRTTI, MK-8527. So, that will also be coming out this year. We will be able to see those. So, it is the RSV. It is the dengue that was just out there, and it is the HIV data that we are going to be very interested in seeing across this year.\nRob Davis: Yes. And Steve, just to maybe, from a commercial perspective, build on the question, from a launch timing perspective, our expectation is that we would be in the market in 2025. And obviously, we are working to be ready for that season in 2025. And then from \u2013 a differentiator for us, recall that our coverage covers what is the full prevention season for RSV, which is five months to six months. We are a single fixed dose, not a weight-based administered shot. So, for us, those are all very important things. And the last thing I would note is the site of action for us is really, we think, has low risk of development of resistance and is different than the competition. So, we actually are very bullish on this. I think we don\u2019t talk about it, frankly, because we have so many other good things to talk about. It sometimes gets lost. But it doesn\u2019t mean we are not excited about this and/or dengue, which frankly, I still believe dengue is a little bit, obviously, later than this, but huge for us. So, those were things we are excited about. It just reinforces the breadth of the portfolio we have.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Steve. Next question please, Ivy.\nOperator: Next we will go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. If I could ask about immunology, essentially a reentry into that realm with the Prometheus acquisition, if you could just update us on what we should be expecting to learn and also what you find interesting perhaps being to further build out on the immunology platform. Specifically, the clinicaltrials.gov has the Phase 2 maintenance data and UC is enrolling. Should we expect to hear from you on results there? I did not observe something there on Crohn\u2019s disease. What\u2019s the update on that program? And then in immunology further, it appeared from the start of the year a lot of excitement about different modalities, cell therapies in particular, oral advanced treatments. Share with us some views on where you think immunology could go to take Merck to be a relevant presence in the 2030s. Thank you.\nDean Li: Chris, that\u2019s a great question and an expansive question. So, let me just hit in relationship to the TL1A antibody. We have our ulcerative colitis trial moving forward, and that\u2019s been listed and that\u2019s moving forward. I think probably the really important thing for me that I look out is getting the Crohn\u2019s disease trial moving. The reason I think it\u2019s really important is I will remind myself that TL1A is in the super TNF family. But TL1A may be different than run-of-the-mill TNF in its ability to not just dampen inflammation, but affect fibrosis. So, going from ulcerative colitis to Crohn\u2019s disease, Crohn\u2019s disease has lots of strictures in this. That will be important. And it will be also important to look and follow \u2013 I follow our data in TL1A in relationship to lung disease and scleroderma. So, that\u2019s with that. I would also emphasize that there are other assets within the partnership or acquisition that we did with Prometheus and those compounds, which had already been discussed previously are advancing through the pipeline as well. And then the other question that you have is, are we interested in other platforms and moving forward, the answer is absolutely yes. I think you had a question in terms of cell therapy with immunology. I think there is interesting there. But as you know, we have \u2013 when we have looked at cell therapy in relationship to cancer, especially not in heme, but in solid, we have been a little bit probably more exploratory. And right now, our view of cell therapy in immunology is one that might be more similar to our view of cell therapy in solid tumor, a little bit more exploratory.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Chris. Ivy, we have time for one more question please.\nOperator: And for our final question, we will go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask you on your ADC platform, if you feel that what you have is enough for now or do you want to expand or add on to it. And any interest in radiopharmaceuticals? Thank you.\nDean Li: Thank you very much for that question. So, when we think about tissue targeting, we think of ADCs. And the answer is, I think the ADC fields will continue to develop, and I think there will be other payloads, other linkers, but also the specificity by which you do the tissue targeting in relationship to the antibody may change. There is also clearly evidence of potential movements into peptide drug conjugates that we are interested in as well as the possibility that the payload is no longer chemotherapy-based, but other sort of compound-based. So, we are interested in that. In tissue targeting more broadly, we are interested, and so we view that as, okay, that\u2019s how we are going to move sort of toxic cell chemotherapy agents into tissue targeting sort of scheme making chemotherapy precision medicine. But we also are very interested in the IO space in relationship to tissue targeting, and that is \u2013 our foray in that is really helped by our proposed acquisition with Harpoon that has a very interesting asset in relationship to tissue targeting and immune engagers.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Louise and thank you all for the really good questions and appreciate you sticking to mostly one question. We got to a lot of questioners, so appreciate that. If you have any follow-ups, please reach out to IR. We will be seeing you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in the Merck & Company Q4 sales and earnings conference call. That concludes today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning. Today, I will provide notable R&D updates since our last earnings call and a brief summary of 2023 accomplishments. Momentum in the pipeline remains strong. Progress is spanning both early- and late-phase programs across multiple therapeutic areas. Starting with Oncology, we are diversifying our portfolio and executing on our strategy, which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immunooncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. In immunooncology, we remain committed to the development of KEYTRUDA and further transforming cancer care to address the needs of certain patients. In the fourth quarter, we received approvals from both the FDA and the European Commission in two gastrointestinal indications: one in combination with chemotherapy for the first line treatment of adults with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesaphageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-A59; and another in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer based on KEYNOTE-966. As we continue to harness the potential of KEYTRUDA, we have an increased focus on earlier stages of disease, where we believe timely, effective intervention may significantly improve patient outcomes. Last month, we announced FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of fecal Stage 3 through 4A cervical cancer based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial. This is an important advancement and provides a new option that has potential to become the standard of care. To-date, with all the research conducted with checkpoint inhibitors, the only studies that have demonstrated statistically significant overall survival benefit in earlier stage cancers are KEYTRUDA-based regimens: KEYNOTE-671 as part of a neoadjuvant followed by post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer and KEYNOTE-564 as a post-surgery adjuvant treatment regimen for certain patients with renal cell carcinoma. Since the approval of a KEYNOTE-671 in October, it is notable that the American Cancer Society released guidance recommending that certain individuals with significant smoking history undergo an annual low-dose CT scan. The guidance also expands the age range for lung cancer screening. We look forward to the opportunity to help impact patients and support the identification of more patients at risk. Additional data from KEYNOTE-564 demonstrating an overall survival benefit were presented at the ASCO GU conference last week. Detailed findings from KEYNOTE-123 evaluating KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized, muscle-invasive and locally advanced, resectable urothelial carcinoma demonstrating a disease-free survival benefit versus observation were also presented at ASCO GU. Also in the earlier-stage setting, along with our partner, Moderna, we announced 3-year recurrent-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival data for our individualized neoantigen therapy, V940, in combination with KEYTRUDA for the adjuvant treatment of Stage 3 and 4 melanoma following complete resection. We are encouraged by the durability of the responses observed and the potential for this regimen to impact patients earlier in their diagnosis. The Phase 3 trials in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are actively enrolling. Progress continues in precision oncology. The FDA approval for WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC following a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI, marks the first drug approved in a new therapeutic class for eligible patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in nearly a decade and builds on the 2021 approval for the treatment of adults with certain von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. Additional Phase 3 pneumococcal studies for WELIREG, in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib for the treatment of certain types of renal cell carcinoma in the advanced and adjuvant settings, are ongoing. Finally, moving to the tissue targeting space. Together with Astellas and Seagen, now Pfizer, we announced the FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev, a Nectin-4-targeting ADC for the first-line treatment to patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer based on results from KEYNOTE-A39. These results demonstrated a superior overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin or carboplatin and extend our pioneering work in combining KEYTRUDA with chemotherapy as well as reinforcing the value of an ADC to enable targeted delivery of chemotherapy to the tumor tissue. Following the announcement of our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo in October, we are pleased to receive priority review from the FDA for MK-1022, or patritumab deruxtecan, our investigation of a fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC for patients with advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The agency has set a target action date of June 26. Through our agreements with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo as well as our own discovery programs, we have established a robust pipeline of tissue-targeting ADCs. And the recently announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics provides the opportunity to help complement and strengthen our approach by providing a portfolio of novel T cell engagers, the most significant of which is HPN-328, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager being evaluated in small cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. Our strong diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents positions us well to have a profound impact on even more patients long into the future. Next to our Vaccine pipeline. We are making notable advancements with our population-specific vaccine program for pneumococcal disease. The FDA has accepted for priority review the new biologics license application for V116, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, specifically designed for adults supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating V116 in both pneumococcal vaccine-naive and vaccine-experienced adult patient population. Results from STRIDE-3 trial were presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November and additional data from STRIDE-3 as well as STRIDE studies 4, 5 and 6 will be presented at the International Society of Pneumonia and Pneumococcal Disease Congress in March. If approved, as Rob noted, V116 would be the first new pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes responsible for approximately 83% of invasive pneumococcal disease in about 65 years of age and older, according to CDC data from 2018 to 2021. Importantly, V116 includes eight unique serotypes, which account for 30% of disease according to the same CDC data. These serotypes are not covered by currently licensed pneumococcal vaccine options. The FDA has set a target action date of June 17. Turning to programs in the cardiometabolic disease pipeline. We are eager to bring sotatercept to patients as an important treatment option for pulmonary arterial hypertension. The FDA has set a target action date of March 26. Beyond data from the STELLAR trial, we have the Phase 3 ZENITH and HYPERION studies, which are evaluating sotatercept in patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on their disease journey. In addition, the Phase 2 CADENCE trial will evaluate WHO Group 2 pulmonary hypertension focused on a type of blood clot disease. As we close out 2023, it is important to highlight our significant progress and execution across therapeutic areas and modalities as well as multiple business development transactions. In the year, we have more than 25 regulatory approvals in major markets. We also initiated over 20 Phase 3 studies across multiple new classes of assets, including in on oncology with bomedemstat, our LSD1 inhibitor in essential thrombocythemia; nemtabrutinib, our BTK inhibitor in first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia of small lymphocytic lymphoma; MK-2870, our TROP2 ADC in collaboration with Kelun in non-small cell lung cancer and endometrial carcinoma; MK-5684, our CYP11A1 inhibitor in collaboration with Orion in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; and V940 in collaboration with Moderna for the adjuvant treatment of certain types of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer; also in immunology, with tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis; finally, in cardiometabolic disease with multiple trials for MK-0616 in hypercholesterolemia. As a result of the increasing depth and breadth of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate an even greater number of Phase 3 trials in 2024. Considerable credit goes to my colleagues across the organization for their hard work and unwavering dedication. We are executing on our science-led strategy and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year. And now I will turn the call back to Peter. I'll take this. Umer, thank you very much for that question. I mean just to recognize that in MSI high, we have a strong presence with pembro there. The larger group in CRC or colorectal cancer is in the MSS population. At this point, there is not really been any checkpoint inhibitor that's shown dramatic impact in MSS CRC. So our interest in driving pembro plus LAG-3 in that is to demonstrate that a checkpoint inhibitor could have a meaningful impact in MSS CRC. If we should get a positive signal in that, clearly, we would use that as a beachhead to expand and extend the role of checkpoint inhibitors in MSS CRC, which is a place that requires a lot of more innovation. In terms of specific interim analysis on this, we generally try to keep that when there is data that's worth sharing, that's when we share it. Thanks. So let me take the first question. So there is a series of trials and relationships with sotatercept. So the March date that we talk about is for a potential decision by the FDA for approval based on the STELLAR trial. And we think in the second half of 2024, we may be in a position in relationship to the EU. We have other trials, as you point out, especially Phase 3 trials, and they are ZENITH and they are HYPERION. Those two are based on events. So it's a tracking of events that sort of define when those happen. So ZENITH, I think, is now like September 2025 and HYPERION, August 2026. So that's just been event-driven. In relationship to how best to treat patients, well we're in conversations with the FDA in relationship to where is the best place for patients to be treated. But I'll just highlight that we have an image of an auto injector moving very fast through our pipeline. So that might give you a sense of where we think this may end up. Yes. So just so that everyone is looking at this asset in the same way, there have been critical medicines that ablate androgen field growth in prostate cancer. And the interest in the SIP is it's very high upstream, and we think that it could be an important contribution. Clearly, we're in \u2013 as you point out, we're interested both broadly, but especially in the specific mutation patients. And so we will be advancing those trials to look at that subpopulation as well as more broad populations. In terms of the statistical sort of analysis in that, that's something that I think probably would be best sort of discussed with our clinical teams at a different time. Yes. So I'll just \u2013 so again, we're talking about V116. We're talking about FDA potential action in June 2024, followed by ACIP, followed by MMWR. I think it's in March that we're going to be presenting STRIDE-3 and 6, and I think the data will be out there. And as you'll see in that, between STRIDE-3 and throughout STRIDE-3 all the way to 6, you'll see data in relationship to vaccination of those who are naive versus previously vaccinated. And you will see data in the patient population \u2013 or the population that 65, but also in the 50-plus as well. As that data is digested, both by the FDA, but probably very importantly, by the ACIP, I think those data will guide how the ACIP makes their decision. Yes. This is Dean. Thanks for that question. So I'll just step back, and I think I've said this previously, especially in lung, it's very important to understand what the standard of care is and that one would have to beat it in a significant way. And the standard of care, in our minds, in the late stage, is roughly KEYNOTE-189. And now in the earlier stage, it's clearly in KEYNOTE-671 both with clear OS data. What we have said previously is that we are unclear that any one ADC can have as broad of an impact as KEYNOTE-189 or 671 and that in order for ADC to have a substantial advantage in those patient populations, one may need to focus on a biomarker-selected patient population. And so the data that we saw does not change our way of thinking. It's the way of thinking that we've discussed previously. And I would just add that it's really important, there is also data out there where people are doing retrospective biomarker data in this. For us to demonstrate true efficacy in any patient population, we need a biomarker strategy that is prospective and one that can be easily actionable throughout the world. Thanks. Yes. So, I will just answer more broadly in relationship to TROP2 as an ADC and specifically our compound. One of the things that is extremely useful to us is its adverse effect profile, especially for lung cancer patients and relationship to lung toxicity is readily manageable. It's a quite good profile. In terms of your question about the paper that I think that you talked about internalization and this I think those are interesting and important papers for us to consider. But I think one of the things that's also important for us to do is to do the clinical experiment and see what the results are in relationship. We are confident that TROP2 ADC will have an impact. TROP2 ADCs in breast cancer has had an impact. And we believe that our TROP2 ADC, especially with the linker and payload, will have an important impact in lung cancer. And then the question that you have is, how do you combine it, do you combine it with chemo, do you combine it with PD-1, how do you think through that, I think those are questions that our clinical team thinks deeply about, but we also think deeply about what line of therapy and also what the standard of care is. And if you want to move to first line standard of care is KEYNOTE-189 with a chemo/pembro basis. So, one has to think about how one would advance a TROP2 from different lines all the way to first line. So, those considerations come in quite heavily. So, this is Dean. I will take the first question and then I will hand it over to Rob and Caroline because the economic question and the payer is also related to the innovation that you provide. I just want to make sure that our way of thinking about something like pembro with hyaluronidase given as subcu is really there is going to be a call for that innovation. I will just emphasize, we constantly speak about the earlier-stage cancer. And right now, we have nine approvals. And as I have said in relationship in the prepared remarks, of those approvals, two \u2013 the only two that have checkpoint inhibitors that have OS benefit is KEYTRUDA base, which is early lung cancer and RCC. I actually just came from a meeting speaking to a bunch of thoracic oncologists in this, and it's quite interesting to hear how they speak for those who are thoracic oncologists, who are linked to setting with medical oncologists, and they very clearly understand why KEYNOTE-671 perioperative is the category one. In situations where you may have a CT surgeon outside of a major care plan or a care \u2013 a major medical center sometimes you have CT surgeons moonlighting doing lobectomies and resection, for that, the KEYNOTE-091. And constantly, what we hear from the physicians and the provider, and many of them are in provider systems of all different types, is the need to have an alternative way to get the KEYTRUDA to them, either Q3, Q6 given the regimen. So, I just want to emphasize that the subcu pembro plus hyaluronidase is an innovation that is going to be demanded and is being demanded by the field. I really appreciate the question. So, I will talk about it. In relationship to the RSV monoclonal antibody, it's for the early birth, it's an antibody, it's passive immunization, and it's for the pediatric population. This is a single shot. This is not weight-based. And we believe it has a longer season in relationship to other choices. And so we think it's an important readout, and we are very excited and interested to move on this RSV monoclonal antibody. I would also emphasize that the New England Journal of Medicine just published a series of papers, not in RSV, but also in dengue that also we are very excited about. And we are moving that forward quickly. And then more broadly from the ID vaccine, I have said previously that I am very intrigued to see the results of our NRTTI islatravir and our other NRTTI, MK-8527. So, that will also be coming out this year. We will be able to see those. So, it is the RSV. It is the dengue that was just out there, and it is the HIV data that we are going to be very interested in seeing across this year. Chris, that's a great question and an expansive question. So, let me just hit in relationship to the TL1A antibody. We have our ulcerative colitis trial moving forward, and that's been listed and that's moving forward. I think probably the really important thing for me that I look out is getting the Crohn's disease trial moving. The reason I think it's really important is I will remind myself that TL1A is in the super TNF family. But TL1A may be different than run-of-the-mill TNF in its ability to not just dampen inflammation, but affect fibrosis. So, going from ulcerative colitis to Crohn's disease, Crohn's disease has lots of strictures in this. That will be important. And it will be also important to look and follow \u2013 I follow our data in TL1A in relationship to lung disease and scleroderma. So, that's with that. I would also emphasize that there are other assets within the partnership or acquisition that we did with Prometheus and those compounds, which had already been discussed previously are advancing through the pipeline as well. And then the other question that you have is, are we interested in other platforms and moving forward, the answer is absolutely yes. I think you had a question in terms of cell therapy with immunology. I think there is interesting there. But as you know, we have \u2013 when we have looked at cell therapy in relationship to cancer, especially not in heme, but in solid, we have been a little bit probably more exploratory. And right now, our view of cell therapy in immunology is one that might be more similar to our view of cell therapy in solid tumor, a little bit more exploratory. Thank you very much for that question. So, when we think about tissue targeting, we think of ADCs. And the answer is, I think the ADC fields will continue to develop, and I think there will be other payloads, other linkers, but also the specificity by which you do the tissue targeting in relationship to the antibody may change. There is also clearly evidence of potential movements into peptide drug conjugates that we are interested in as well as the possibility that the payload is no longer chemotherapy-based, but other sort of compound-based. So, we are interested in that. In tissue targeting more broadly, we are interested, and so we view that as, okay, that's how we are going to move sort of toxic cell chemotherapy agents into tissue targeting sort of scheme making chemotherapy precision medicine. But we also are very interested in the IO space in relationship to tissue targeting, and that is \u2013 our foray in that is really helped by our proposed acquisition with Harpoon that has a very interesting asset in relationship to tissue targeting and immune engagers."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. 2023 was another impactful year for our company. We delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange. Growth was driven by robust performance across oncology, vaccines and animal health. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term while making disciplined investments in innovative science, which will drive long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our fourth quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.6 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 13%. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 14% driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% driven by companion animal products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 22% to $6.6 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, with particularly strong growth in international markets due to the more recent launches of these important indications. Growth was also driven by the strong global need of patients with metastatic disease. We continue to be encouraged by the positive impact our recent approvals are having on certain patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. In the U.S., we have made considerable progress in helping to improve drug treatment rates and have further increased our leadership position in the adjuvant setting. We also received positive feedback from healthcare providers following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39 in advanced urothelial cancer. With this approval, KEYTRUDA in combination with PADCEV is now indicated for first-line advanced urothelial cancer patients regardless of cisplatin eligibility. Based on the outstanding clinical data, we believe this regimen has the potential to transform the standard of care for these patients. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 8% and 5% respectively. WELIREG sales grew 78% to $72 million driven by increased uptake in VHL-associated tumors. We are excited by the opportunity to provide a new treatment option for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma, following the recent approval based on the LITESPARK-005 study. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which increased 27% to $1.9 billion, driven by global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $176 million driven by ongoing launches in Europe and continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 sales in the U.S. benefited from inventory stocking in preparation for the pediatric launch. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales declined 3%. Increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was more than offset by the impact of generic entrants in international markets, particularly in Europe. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 4%. Companion animal sales grew 12% driven by the BRAVECTO line of products due to strong underlying demand and timing of purchases. Livestock sales were flat, reflecting favorable price actions offset by the timing of ruminant product purchases. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77.2%, an increase of 1.5 percentage points largely due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $11.6 billion, including a $5.5 billion one-time charge related to our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting disciplined investment in support of our expansive early-and late-phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other expense was $174 million. Our tax rate was approximately 114%, which reflects the impact of the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Excluding this charge, the underlying tax rate was 13.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $0.03, which includes a $1.69 negative impact from the charge related to Daiichi Sankyo. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. We expect another year of strong growth driven by key marketed products and we will begin to benefit from the anticipated launches of impactful new products, such as sotatercept and V116. We project revenue to be between $62.7 billion and $64.2 billion, representing growth of 4% to 7%. This growth includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 2% using mid-January rates. The headwind is primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which we expect will largely be offset by inflation-related price increases, consistent with market practice. Our gross margin assumption is approximately 80.5%, which includes the benefit from reduced royalties paid on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Operating expenses are assumed to be between $25.1 billion and $26.1 billion, which includes an approximate $650 million one-time charge related to the announced acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $200 million. We assume a full year tax rate between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $8.44 to $8.59. This range includes an approximate $0.26 per share charge related to the planned acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which is not tax-deductible and the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.25 using mid-January rates, including the impact from Argentina. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We are excited by the significant progress our team has made to advance and augment our innovative pipeline in 2023. In 2024, we will increase this investment, including the initiation of more late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, we enter 2024 with confidence in the outlook for our business in the near and long term. Global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines remain strong, and we are excited about our expansive pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength as a direct result of our longstanding commitment to science in order to improve the lives of the patients we serve. Our continued investment in innovation and excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Thank you for the question, Evan. This is Caroline. As we've guided for 2024, we're very confident in the underlying momentum in our business across Oncology, across Vaccines, across Animal Health. We also are very excited about the potential launches for sotatercept and V116. For sotatercept, given the significant clinical data we have and the understanding that there are many patients that have already been identified who can benefit for sotatercept on top of the treatments they have, we are expecting a strong launch. For V116, as Dean just outlined, we will wait for the FDA approval, the ACIP recommendation. We will then expect MMWR to publish, and therefore, expect to have impact with V116 coming towards the end of this year. The only add, if I may is we had significant opportunity to protect further females in China. At the end of 2023, we also submitted to the regulatory authorities our data on GARDASIL for males. So, we are hopeful to introduce that in the Chinese market in the future. Thank you for the question, Geoff. So, as you all know, our company has made great progress in expanding operating margin over a number of years. As we look to 2024, we expect operating margin to improve. And that's really driven by the strength of the top line and mix of revenue by the roll-off of royalties that we have noted on KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. Being disciplined in our expenses, while we do invest fully behind our expansive pipeline, as we go beyond 2024, we still point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in 2025. But our focus as a company and as a team is to really ensure that we are fueling the pipeline supporting the portfolio of products that we are launching to drive growth into the long-term."

            "content": "Thanks Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. 2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we have made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone. Over half of which were through donations. We also made substantial investments in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover and bring forward to patients the next generation of impactful innovations, over $30 billion in total, including the cost of certain acquisitions and collaborations. As we move forward, I am confident that our strong momentum will continue, underpinned by the unwavering dedication of our talented global team. We are realizing the benefits of our sustained focus on key strategic priorities. The excellence of our commercial and operational execution enables us to deliver tangible value in the short-term while we invest in new innovations and strengthen our pipeline for the long-term. In 2023, we advanced important clinical programs and augmented our pipeline with promising business development, such as the acquisition of Prometheus and our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Guided by our science-led strategy, I am confident that the focused and disciplined business decisions we make and the actions we take will lead to sustainable benefits for the patients we serve and long-term growth and value for our shareholders. Turning to our results and initial outlook for 2024, we delivered excellent underlying growth in 2023, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. I am pleased to share that we expect continued strong growth in 2024 driven by demand for our key products, which Caroline will speak to momentarily. Turning to the progress we are making in research, we are currently pursuing programs across a more diverse set of therapeutic areas with high unmet need and across more modalities than at any time in recent memory. This year, we will remain keenly focused on advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, which includes two launches that will address critical health needs and have blockbuster commercial opportunity. In cardiometabolic, we are very excited by the anticipated FDA action on our application for sotatercept in the United States, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for many patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our commercial and manufacturing teams are fully prepared for the strong uptake we expect. Sotatercept is an important component of our growing cardiometabolic pipeline, which we believe has significant long-term potential. In vaccines, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for V116. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older. Based on its compelling profile, V116 has the potential to become an important new preventative option for adults and we believe it can achieve majority market share in this setting. We look forward to a potential approval in June. And in oncology, we continue to expand into additional tumor types in earlier stages of certain cancers as well as progress our increasingly broad pipeline of novel candidates. We have achieved substantial diversification with a dramatically expanded set of late-stage programs, which Dean will speak to. I am confident that Merck is well positioned to provide important innovation to patients and sustain its leadership in oncology well into the future. I know Dean and his team are energized by our progress and are prepared to build on the success we have had in 2023 to further advance Merck's pipeline and bring transformative innovation to patients this year and beyond. In summary, our science-led strategy, which keeps the patient at the center of everything we do, is delivering important advancements and helping us build a sustainable growth engine for our company. We have made considerable progress over the past year in advancing and expanding our pipeline, which has resulted in substantially increased long-term commercial opportunities. We have taken meaningful steps to diversify and position ourselves for sustained leadership in oncology while also building one of our deepest and broadest pipelines across discovery and development in our recent history outside of oncology and notably in cardiometabolic and immunology. Further, we also expect to benefit from promising late-stage programs across our vaccines, neurosciences, HIV and animal health pipelines, a robust set of early phase programs and the potential to add exciting innovation through future science-led business development. As a result, we are increasingly confident that we are well positioned to drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the next decade. I would again like to thank our global teams for their commitment to strong research, commercial and operational execution. With a concerted focus on achieving continued excellence, I am very confident in our ability to deliver short and long-term stakeholder value. I look forward to providing future updates on our progress and impact. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Just real quick, just quick microphone check. Can you hear us? You can? Okay, we were showing we are muted. Sorry. Alright. Good. Sure. Adam, thanks for the question. So there has actually been Chinese competitors with an offering for some time actually in the Chinese market. And that market is large. We continue to believe in the eligible cohorts in just the urban females, which was the Tier 1 to Tier 3 cities, is about 200 million \u2013 a little over 200 million women. And so of that, we think probably about 30% have actually received vaccination. So, you are still looking at 120 million, 130 million eligible population. As we look at this and as we have seen over time, we continue to be very competitive. We are maintaining a vast majority of share in the private market. And really, you are seeing most of the local competitors go to the lower-tier cities and to a different population than we have been targeting. So, that does not change our view of the growth potential in China. Long-term, obviously we will continue to face competition there, and we are positioning ourselves to continue to succeed there. But the approval you are talking about is not changing our view. Yes. I will start and then Caroline can jump in as well. But I think as you look at the market size and the comments, I don't want to speak to comments that others have made. I think it's also important to understand that as we bring a vaccine which brings significant incremental coverage, at 83% versus, if you look at PCV20, just as an example, it's closer to, I think about 30%. So, you are looking at significant incremental coverage, which I think it can have an impact on how you think both about catch-up to cover the disease. As Dean noted in his prepared comments, we have eight serotypes covering 30% of what is causing disease, which is unique to us. So, we think that, that will have implications both in terms of the catch-ups as well as potentially to be able to go for patients 50 and plus versus 65 and plus. So, if you take all of those things into account, we still see this as a very large opportunity for us. Our view is it's about an $8 billion market in \u201823. We anticipate it actually growing to be over $10 billion later in the decade. And with that being the pediatric segment of that is about 70%, so we are looking at 30% of that is what is the adult piece. So, as we see it, this is still a growing market, a good market. And we remain very confident that V116 will both have a majority share and be a meaningful contributor. Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, first, I just want to reinforce the pride I have in what Dean and the team have been able to do and the meaningful progress we are making both in our internal pipeline and what we have been able to do through the business development, which is I think in some ways, in a weird way, underlying your question. But as we sit here today, while I feel very good about the progress we have made in the growing portfolio, the diverse and deep portfolio we have in our pipeline, we do continue to believe we need more, and we will continue to prioritize business development. And I would say that our views of deals like Prometheus, like Acceleron are still the size of deals we are very interested in, if we can find great assets. So, clearly that's an area of focus. But also continuing to do smaller deals as well, like what you saw with Harpoon. So, it's going to be a range of deals. But I think as you look in that zero to kind of $15 billion, $1 billion to $15 billion, it continues to be where we will look for. And then obviously, we have also, I think shown that not only are we very open to doing an acquisition, but we see collaboration as an important tool as well, very similar to what we did with Daiichi Sankyo. So, we are going to be looking at the full suite and including deals that fit those categories. Yes. Thanks Dean. And to the questions on the economics, and I think we have commented on this a little bit in various settings. But as we think about our strategy for bringing this to the market from a commercial perspective, our view is the quality-of-life benefits this brings does demonstrate and afford us the ability to get a premium price. But we also are very cognizant that any subcu pembro will have to be considered in the context of a generic IV version. So, we will price our subcu to drive for volume and to do for conversion, which means we will be looking at prices really more in line with where you would see the generic version at a premium that history has shown is very manageable and expected and covered by payers today when you look at the different delivery for them. So, in that sense, we think we will be able to manage this. The whole question of Part B versus Part D, we will have to see how it plays out as far as the ultimate side of administration. But if it does end up being into the Part D category, which is a reasonable chance, you are correct and that some of the new coverages that are out there in catastrophic and with the cap, also then from a patient perspective, should lower the burden they are going to face, which we also think could help with conversion. Yes. And Steve, just to maybe, from a commercial perspective, build on the question, from a launch timing perspective, our expectation is that we would be in the market in 2025. And obviously, we are working to be ready for that season in 2025. And then from \u2013 a differentiator for us, recall that our coverage covers what is the full prevention season for RSV, which is five months to six months. We are a single fixed dose, not a weight-based administered shot. So, for us, those are all very important things. And the last thing I would note is the site of action for us is really, we think, has low risk of development of resistance and is different than the competition. So, we actually are very bullish on this. I think we don't talk about it, frankly, because we have so many other good things to talk about. It sometimes gets lost. But it doesn't mean we are not excited about this and/or dengue, which frankly, I still believe dengue is a little bit, obviously, later than this, but huge for us. So, those were things we are excited about. It just reinforces the breadth of the portfolio we have."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck\u2019s third quarter 2023 conference call. Speaking on today\u2019s call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release. I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe-Harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck\u2019s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.

Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. During today\u2019s call, slide presentation will accompany our speakers\u2019 prepared remarks. These slides along with the earnings release, today\u2019s prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We continue to bring forward innovation that can save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world. We are advancing our broad pipeline and executing in support of our key growth drivers, enabling strong progress for our business and providing tangible benefits to patients. To that end, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our talented global team. Their passion and commitment to our science-led strategy are fundamental to our continued success. Scientific innovation is truly the foundation of our strategy and it drives everything we do. We are pushing the boundaries of science through the significant investments we are making across our deep pipeline augmented by strategic business development. I am pleased by the continued progress with these programs and our growing diversity across new therapeutic areas and modalities. Along these lines, we are particularly excited by our recently announced clinical and commercial collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo for three potentially first-in-class antibody drug conjugates. The scientists at Daiichi Sankyo are proven innovators in this space, having developed proprietary ADC technology that has resulted in an approved product, which is being rapidly adopted for patients with certain cancers. We are privileged to begin working alongside them to advance this important science and achieve both companies\u2019 objectives of addressing the significant unmet patient need in oncology. Based on our strong conviction in these programs and the profound benefit they may bring to patients, we believe each has multi-billion dollar commercial revenue potential for Merck on a non-risk adjusted basis approaching the mid-2030s. We are also applying our clinical expertise to accelerate the development of other potentially transformative treatments that we have added through strategic business development, such as sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension and MK-7240, our TL1A inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. This is complemented by our strong commercial execution capabilities, which we expect to amplify the impact of these life changing medicines and enable the creation of sustainable value for patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning to this quarter\u2019s performance. We delivered robust growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. We are confident that we will close out 2023 with continued strong performance, which is reflected in the updated full year outlook that Caroline will speak to in a few minutes. Moving to our research organization, as I mentioned, we are making remarkable progress across multiple therapeutic areas in our promising late-phase pipeline. In oncology, Dean will speak to the significant success we are having in broadly leveraging, the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA. This includes the continued advancements we are making in the treatment of earlier stage cancers. We are very excited by the recent FDA approval of a KEYTRUDA regimen for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-671 trial results, which notably demonstrated an improvement in overall survival compared to a placebo and chemotherapy regimen. In addition, we presented numerous important datasets at last week\u2019s European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, across a wide range of molecules, tumor types and indications. Our progress across a broad set of programs reinforces our confidence in the sustainability of our oncology leadership well into the next decade. We are also making exciting progress in our cardiometabolic pipeline. Most significantly, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for sotatercept based on the unprecedented results of the STELLAR trial and we look forward to the potential approval and launch in early 2024. We remain confident that sotatercept has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We also initiated Phase 3 clinical trials for our oral PCSK9 candidate, MK-0616. We believe MK-0616 has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients with elevated cholesterol and impact cardiovascular disease on a global scale. We are very pleased with our progress and what we have achieved this quarter, as we continue to focus on advancing and expanding Merck\u2019s pipeline and I want to thank Dean and his team for their unwavering commitment to addressing unmet patient needs. In summary, we continue to move with urgency to deliver on our purpose, pursuing transformative science to save and improve lives around the world. We are executing scientifically, commercially and operationally on the significant opportunities now in front of us, while also making the disciplined investments needed to sustain strong growth well into the future. With the efforts of our global team, we have increased confidence that we will deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we achieved very strong growth this quarter driven by robust underlying demand across our innovative portfolio and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term. We are also making disciplined investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world well into the future, positioning us to deliver long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 10%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 17% to $6.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand for metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased utilization in both metastatic indications and earlier stage cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer. Uptake in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer remains strong and KEYTRUDA has now achieved brand leadership in this setting, reflecting the significant impact it is having as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA disease. Our recently approved KEYNOTE-671 indication provides an important additional treatment option to patients and physicians by including usage in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. We remain exceptionally well positioned to serve patients with non-small cell lung cancer and extend our leadership to the earlier stage setting. In bladder cancer, we are excited to potentially expand usage of KEYTRUDA to cisplatin-eligible patients based on the compelling results from the KEYNOTE-A39 study. If approved, this study would more than double the eligible patient population for KEYTRUDA in first-line bladder cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as increased demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor, with alliance revenue growing 6% this quarter. Lenvima alliance revenue had growth of 30%, driven by shipment timing in China, which we expect will negatively impact growth in the fourth quarter. Growth was also driven by increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 16% to $2.6 billion, driven by underlying global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales decreased due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccine sales also benefited from continued uptake in the pediatric indication of VAXNEUVANCE in the U.S. and its launch in key European markets. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales were flat as increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was offset by the impact of generic entry in Europe. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales grew 7% reflecting price actions as well as higher demand for ruminant products. Companion animal sales declined due to a reduction in vet visits in the U.S., partially offset by pricing actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, consistent with last year as the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange was offset by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $5.8 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with $690 million of charges a year ago. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of our robust early and late-phase pipeline, with research and development expenses increasing 17%. Other expense was $133 million. Our tax rate was 15%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.13. Before I cover the outlook for the balance of the year, I wanted to briefly touch upon the recently announced strategic collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. This transaction follows a similar, de-risked and disciplined financial structure as we have employed in prior successful collaborations and we are very excited about the opportunity to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance, which includes the strategic collaboration with Daiichi. The continuing operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $59.7 and $60.2 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong double-digit underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $39.8 billion and $40.4 billion. This range reflects $17.1 billion in acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses, including $5.5 billion for the collaboration with Daiichi, as well as those associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $200 million, which reflects updated foreign exchange expectations given recent dollar strengthening and higher net interest expense related to Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 39% and 40%, which includes an approximate 24.5-percentage-point impact related to our business development activity. Our underlying tax rate is approximately 14.5% to 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $1.33 to $1.38. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 6 percentage points versus 2022 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $2.95 to $3.05. Including the one-time charge of $5.5 billion or $1.70 per share and an estimated $0.04 to advance the assets and financing costs from the collaboration with Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $1.21 to $1.31, with a midpoint of $1.26. Our current guidance midpoint of $1.36 represents an increase resulting from strength in our business of approximately $0.15, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05. Now turning to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are proud of the significant progress our team is making to advance and augment our pipeline, including our collaboration with Daiichi. We will continue to invest in our pipeline, which contains many assets with tremendous potential to address significant unmet medical needs, positioning us for strong performance well into the future. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development continues to be a high priority. Our track record demonstrates our ability to identify compelling science and technologies that have the potential to advance standard-of-care, access such opportunities in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner, and importantly, to rapidly progress the opportunities for the benefit of the patients we serve and our shareholders. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business in the near- and long-term, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and Vaccines and our exceptional pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will start with our oncology programs followed by vaccines, immunology and conclude with cardiometabolic disease. Over the last few years, our oncology strategy has focused on leveraging the remarkable properties of KEYTRUDA to establish a diverse clinical pipeline of candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities. This is broadly based on three strategic pillars, immuno-oncology, precision oncology and tissue targeting. In immuno-oncology, we continue to evaluate KEYTRUDA in the metastatic and increasingly in earlier stage disease settings, while also investigating multiple novel immuno-oncology combinations and coformulations. With precision oncology, we are selectively targeting pathways to inhibit cancer cell growth. And in tissue targeting, we are developing agents such as antibody-drug conjugates designed to increase cancer cell sensitivity and killing. The latter is exemplified by our recently announced collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Daiichi Sankyo scientists have made pioneering contributions in advancing novel antibody drug conjugate technology with proven benefit to patients. By combining our companies\u2019 respective strengths, we are well-positioned to accelerate three clinical stage potentially first-in-class candidates with the goal of transforming the treatment paradigm. These include, Patritumab deruxtecan, an investigational fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC, in Phase 3, Ifinatamab deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti-B7-H3 ADC in Phase 2 and Raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti CDH6 targeted ADC in Phase 1. We provided details during our investor event earlier this week and are eager to begin working with the team. The Daiichi Sankyo collaboration complements our important, ongoing alliance with Kelun Biotech, whose talented scientists have developed their own innovative ADC platform. At ESMO, new Phase 2 data for MK-2870 or SKB-264, a TROP-2 targeting ADC, in patients with previously treated metastatic, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, showed encouraging anti-tumor activity with an objective response rate of 36.8%. This builds on existing data for MK-2870 both in triple-negative breast and non-small cell lung cancer. We are now poised to initiate larger studies starting with non-small cell lung cancer and expand into additional tumor types. We are also advancing clinical development of MK-1200, an ADC targeting Claudin 18.2. Recognizing the proven benefit of KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy in certain tumor types, we are exploring the tissue-targeting concept by evaluating regimens combining ADCs and immunotherapy. At ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, potentially practice-changing survival data were presented from KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302, evaluating KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This regimen represents the first approval of a combination of a checkpoint inhibitor and an ADC. Turning to immuno-oncology. Evidence continues to emerge for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of earlier stage cancer. Positive survival data from KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer compared to pre-operative chemotherapy were presented at ESMO, further reinforcing the benefit of routine lung cancer screening for certain populations to enable early intervention. Based on the KEYNOTE-671 results, last week the FDA approved this indication with a differentiated label that includes overall survival. KEYTRUDA has now been approved for six indications to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer. KEYNOTE-671 represents the eighth approval for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage cancer. Positive data from additional earlier stage studies in women\u2019s cancers were also presented at ESMO for KEYNOTE-756 in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, for KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple negative breast cancer, and KEYNOTE-A18 for patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. The FDA recently granted priority review for KEYTRUDA based upon this study with a target action date of January 20th. We also announced KEYTRUDA significantly improved disease-free-survival for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized muscle-invasive and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-123. And finally, in collaboration with Moderna, the Phase 3 trial for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an individualized neoantigen therapy, in earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer has now been posted and is poised to start soon. In precision oncology, our efforts continue to yield progress. WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor, is approved for treatment of certain cancers in patients with von Hippel Lindau Disease, a rare cancer-prone genetic disorder. Studies evaluating WELIREG in broader populations of patients whose tumors display analogous genetic underpinnings are ongoing. Data presented at ESMO from LITESPARK-005 evaluating WELIREG for adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapies showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus the standard-of-care. These findings support our supplemental new drug application for WELIREG, which was granted priority review by the FDA with a target action date of January 17th. Additional Phase 3 studies in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib in advanced and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma are proceeding. First-time safety and preliminary efficacy data for MK-1084, our oral KRAS inhibitor both as monotherapy in patients with solid tumors and in combination with KEYTRUDA for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors harbored KRAS G12C mutations were presented at ESMO. Notably, the combination arm showed a compelling objective response rate of 71%. While the data are early, we are encouraged by the potential to combine MK-1084 with KEYTRUDA. In the hematologic space, we will begin enrolling patients in our Phase 3 study evaluating MK-3543 or bomedemstat, as second line treatment for essential thrombocythemia, an area with tremendous patient need. Bomedemstat is derived from our acquisition of Imago. Outside of the U.S., the European Union granted approval for KEYTRUDA for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are at high risk of recurrence following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091. And for KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with certain gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-811. In Japan, Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone was approved for BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with distant metastasis based on the PROpel study. Now to our broader pipeline. Building on the ongoing launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which Caroline mentioned, progress continues in our population-focused pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. V116, our investigational pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults has demonstrated a robust immune response to all 21 serotypes in the STRIDE-3 and STRIDE-6 studies. Detailed findings from the STRIDE-3 study will be presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address serotypes responsible for the majority of adult invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. Our company has deep expertise, given our breadth and depth of knowledge both in immuno-oncology and vaccines. We are leveraging these capabilities in immunology, where the first patient is ready to be enrolled in the Phase 3 trial for MK-7240 in ulcerative colitis. Turning to cardiometabolic disease programs. Last month at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, we presented data for sotatercept, currently under review by the FDA for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis of right heart catheterization and echocardiography data from patients in the Phase 3 STELLAR study, patients with PAH treated with sotatercept for 24 weeks on top of background therapy showed a reduction in right heart size and improved right-ventricular function and hemodynamic status. In addition, we presented promising data from an analysis of the Phase 3 SOTERIA open-label extension study in PAH. The results support the potential long-term durability of the response to sotatercept and represent the longest safety and efficacy analysis for this compound to-date. Given the serious patient need in pulmonary arterial hypertension, our regulatory and clinical teams worked swiftly to submit the necessary regulatory filings for sotatercept. The FDA has accepted the Biologics License Application under priority review with a target action date of March 26th. In addition, the submission to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the European Union has been completed. Also in cardiology, momentum continues in the clinical development program for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor. We have initiated the CORALreef Lipids study in a broad patient population and CORALreef Outcomes, a randomized, double-blinded study, evaluating the efficacy of MK-0616 with respect to major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, as well as a separate CORALreef study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Over the last three years, we have moved with rigor and urgency to advance the best science while carefully coordinating our efforts internally and externally. We have and continue to leverage the foundational properties of KEYTRUDA while adding promising candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities in oncology. At the same time, we have expanded in our focused areas of excellence to establish a diverse pipeline of promising candidates spanning multiple additional disease areas. We understand there is still work to be done, but the tangible advances we are making underscore our purpose of creating innovative medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives. And now I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Dean. Julie, we are ready to take questions. And as usual, we request that analysts limit themselves to a single question please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. The comments from the capital allocation standpoint seem to indicate that you feel that you have done some critical mass and certainly some of the deals that you have done have been very important and meaningful. You set the cardiovascular revenue goal in 2030 to $10 billion. Do you think you have done enough there and then to provoke relatedly, Animal Health, do you still feel that that fits within the portfolio, you have been building, but is there reshaping that\u2019s still could come? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Great, Chris. This is Rob and I will maybe start and Dean or Caroline can jump-in if they would like. But first and foremost, I appreciate the comments and as we sit here today, Dean, made reference to it, we feel very good about the progress we have made over the last couple of years through the assets we brought in. You mentioned cardiometabolic, but also immunology, the progress we are making to broaden our position in Oncology and I will get to you in a moment, but as you mentioned the durable growth drivers we have with Vaccines and Animal Health. But specifically to the cardiometabolic area, I can tell you that today as we sit here and just to remind people what we had commented on in the past, we have said, based on both what we received through the acquisition of Acceleron plus other programs that we have been developing internally, we expected that we could be in a position to have greater than $10 billion of revenue potential in the mid-2030s and I\u2019d remind everyone that was on a risk-adjusted basis. But I would tell you as we sit here today, given what we have seen with the remarkable data from STELLAR, the excitement that is coming and we are seeing from key opinion leaders, with the potential launch of sotatercept hopefully early next year and approval even in Europe next year, our confidence that we will achieve that $10 plus billion is higher today than it was when we made the original comment. So we feel very good, doesn\u2019t mean we feel like we are done, but we feel very good about the progress. And then as you reflected on Animal Health. We continue to see the Animal Health business as an important business for us, it a durable growth driver. As we look forward, it continues to be a business that we think will be accretive to our growth long-term and it has strategic value to us, where we are both benefiting from the synergies that it brings to us and that it benefits from the synergies coming from the science that we have on the Human Health side. So as we sit here today, we remain committed that it is the strategic part of the company. But as I have often said, that\u2019s not a philosophical view that is unchanged, it\u2019s something we are very objective about and we look out regularly. But I can tell you as we have continued to look at it, our view has not changed.\nDr. Dean Li: I would just add one thing, Chris, in relationship to your question, but not related to revenues or finance. I would just remind that we have made incredible advances in cancer and we are known as an oncology company. But the unmet need -- the unmet patient needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in the U.S. and in the world is quite substantial, and I don\u2019t know that we are ever going to be done with that field in the near-term, so we are still very committed to do more.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nMara Goldstein: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I am curious the discussion around KEYTRUDA and migrating components of the revenue to earlier lines of therapy. Relative to when you first made statements about where you expect it to be from a percentage, do you think you are ahead of that at this point in time or on-track to where you originally thought you would be today.\nRob Davis: Yeah. The short answer, Mara, is we are ahead of our -- of where we thought we would be. And just to remind everyone, we have been commenting that we expect 50% of our growth to come from movement into the earlier stages of disease in oncology, as we look forward to ultimately get to a global percent with it being about 25% of our total revenues. But I can tell you as where we sit here today, we are tracking ahead of where we expected we would be. And obviously not surprising when you see just a phenomenal results from KEYNOTE-671, what that\u2019s going to mean in the perioperative space for people in early-stage lung cancer building on 091, the continued strength we are seeing across adjuvant and RCC and melanoma, we are up now to eight approvals in this space. So we are in a very good position. But I may about ask Caroline if she has anything she would like to add.\nCaroline Litchfield: The only thing I\u2019d add, Rob, is to your point, we have made tremendous progress. We think this year we will have 20% of our KEYTRUDA business coming from the earlier stage cancer setting. And as we move forward given the tremendous state we have had and indications coming, we are really excited about the opportunities of further growth in lung, in potentially bladder and many other indications.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. I just want to make as a call out, because we had an investor discussion this past Sunday and we are really focused on the ADC and Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, but I just want to call out that for me KEYNOTE-671 is a watershed moment for the field. I would remind everyone that a similar watershed happened in metastatic lung cancer in 2018 KEYNOTE-189 and 2018 is when KEYNOTE-671 was initiated. It\u2019s an earlier stage and only after 5.5 years, after only 5.5 years in an earlier stage trial, you have clear evidence of EFS and OS benefit and I really think this will catalyze a change in how we treat early-stage lung cancer, how we detect early lung cancer and how we screen. If you think about treating early those patients with Stage 2 and 3, you can reduce their mortality by 28%. I think it will catalyze people really looking at any one going to surgery in Stage 2 and 3, not just in Stage 3, people are going to have to think very carefully of why someone should get this regimen. In terms of detecting early, I think it\u2019s really important. How many individuals have a chest CT or chest x-ray with incidental findings and there\u2019s little follow-up and day and age of electronic health records, it\u2019s very easy to figure out how many people have incidental nodules that never got followed up. I think that will change. And I think in screening, early we have guidelines, where the adherence is only 6% to 7% and these guidelines were set four, five years ago, where the concept was it would reduce mortality by 20%. With these data that we have, that number is no longer at 20%, it\u2019s much lower. And so, I think there will be a push by the American Cancer Society, NCCN, NCI, NIH to simplify and broaden those guidelines, because that is -- this is the inexorable march of IO into earlier stage and into the most important cancer, which is lung cancer, which is the number one cause of death for women and the number one cause for men and our commitment to this field is not just 671 and 91, it is also as we highlighted our interest of moving INT the individualized neoantigen therapy into earlier stage in lung cancer.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Mara. Next question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe the risk of going back to that ADC topic. One of the key questions and sort of the back-and-forth has come out in the TROP2 space, it\u2019s just the ability to combine your TROP2 with IO going forward has been a lot of commentary on the myelosuppression there and to the extent that may restrict your ability to combine with IO. Dean, would love to get your thoughts there and any additional commentary you can provide?\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. Specifically to any ADC that we would advance in any tissue tumor type, one thinks about monotherapy and one thinks about a clear indication and a line of sight, but one also thinks about how the field develops and in combinations and those combinations can be with PD -1s, but I would also highlight, it can be with chemo, it can be RAS, it can be with novel hormonal agents, it can be with PAR, it can be with other ADCs and you have to think from late and earlier. In relationship to TROP2, specifically in non-small cell lung cancer, I believe that I have said in the past that, one has to think about how the field has evolved, there was a watershed moment, it was KEYNOTE-189 and pembro plus chemo in a broad patient population along that indication do really well. So those of us who want to advance, what I would say, in ADC and NextGen chemo, that\u2019s how I think about it, have to think about a way to combine it with PD-1 in a way that is not just effective, but substantially effective over KEYNOTE-189. We are very interested in advancing our TROP2 ADC in relationship to that and that combination, like all chemotherapy based treatments, whether it\u2019s chemotherapy or whether it\u2019s chemotherapy on a payload with ADC, one has to think about adverse effects and combinatorial adverse effects and the ability to keep patients on the medicines. The data that we have shown with our partner, our valued partner Kelun is that we think that there is room to be able to advance MK-2870 and PD-1 in a variety of tumors and that they are combinable, tolerable and will be effective, but those are the trials that we are starting to do in Phase 3 in the ex-China regulatory arena.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Carter. Next question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nSeamus Fernandez: Well, thanks so much for the question. So just wanted to talk about margins and some of the margin targets that you have offered, I think historically, you called out 2024 margin target of better than 42%, just trying to get a better sense of how we are tracking towards that target, particularly in the context of the substantial reduction in your royalty burden both for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL. And if you wouldn\u2019t mind, would you perhaps disclose what that cumulative royalty burden was in the third quarter of this year, just so that we can provide some context for the upside case or at least what we should be anticipating there? Thanks so much.\nCaroline Litchfield: Seamus, thank you for the question. We have seen really strong margin expansion in our company over the last several years, and as we look-forward, we expect continued margin expansion and that margin expansion really comes from the product mix on the revenue line, it also comes from the roll-off of royalties, as you have just noted, knowing that we have the royalty on global KEYTRUDA sales going from 6.5% to 2.5% at the start of next year and our royalty on GARDASIL going from 7% to zero percent on our global sales, again, at the start of next year will drive significant gross margin improvement. At the same time, we will be investing in our business. We will be disciplined in that investment, but we are investing in the portfolio of products that we have in the market and that we will be launching, as well as investing in our robust and growing pipeline and that obviously includes the Daiichi collaboration, where we have noticed we expect about a $0.25 impact as a result of investing predominantly in the research and development of a wide range of programs, that Dean has partially outlined, as well as this financing costs. We also have made significant progress across our pipelines with many other collaborations, acquisition and the progress we are making with our own internal assets. So, altogether, we still do point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in the year 2025. However, we will not forgo necessary investments in our business to progress our pipeline to ensure that we have advance healthcare and drive growth, which really is our priority.\nRob Davis: Great. Thank you, Seamus. Next question please. Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I guess, another one for Dean on the TROP2 landscape. I know you guys talked over the weekend about your first Phase 3 trial in lung cancer here. Maybe just any more context on the decision to pursue the EGFR mutant population, given what you are seeing from the landscape out there, including some of the Astra data and then what that means for the front-line setting as you try to craft a trial in that broader population? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. So I just want to make sure that whether we are talking about our wonderful partnership with Kelun or with Daiichi Sankyo, we sort of lay out certainly indications that become public, but I want to be very clear that those are not the only indications that we would be interested. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, in relationship to MK-2870 and advancing it more broadly and it relates to the other question, there is -- we still have small numbers, but what\u2019s really interesting for us for 2870, there are differences in the construct in terms of payload, in terms of the linker, in terms of the dart for that. And one of the things that\u2019s interesting to us is at least to-date, we do not see serious IOD and that allows us to think broadly and thoughtfully about its combined ability in relationship to broader indications. So we are very interested in advancing. In terms of 2870 and the specific first trial that\u2019s been revealed, it\u2019s -- I will just tell you, it was driven, because of the data that we have and the data that we have we think is quite good and should be advanced. We are going to advance other ones, but the advancement in the EGFR new population is based on data that our partners Kelun and us have generated and we are very confident in advancing in that specific indication.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Terrence. Next question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Hi. Thank you. Question in relation to trastuzumab and your KEYNOTE-003 trial. I am assuming that you are using a similar type clinical trial design and template for the stats from KEYNOTE-42, where you have a hierarchy. Given this is a PD-L1 enriched trial and with the hierarchy in place, we are expecting an interim potentially the very end of next year, beginning of the following year. Any comments on either design or timing of entrants? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: I would just say that in general principle, your observations of how we develop drugs, especially in the IO has been something that we are known for and the structure was laid out by great leaders from Merck, who laid the basis for that. In relationship to timing of interim analysis, we have generally not commented on interim analysis and we let those interim analysis do what they need to do, which is come and if they are significant, we make that publicly known. If there is significance in relationship to public disclosure, that\u2019s when we do that, but we generally do not lay out the timing of our interim analysis prior to them happening.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Andrew. Next question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about sotatercept, how you are preparing for that launch, what\u2019s your go-to-market strategy and how quickly you expect uptake to be? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yeah. Louise, this is Rob. I will maybe jump-in and Caroline can add if I miss anything. I would tell you that we feel well-prepared. So, obviously, we have been working to ensure we have supply to be able to supply the market upon launch. But as we sit here today, given what is happening in the marketplace. So you are seeing warehousing of patients in anticipation of the launch of sotatercept in the United States. And from feedback from key opinion leaders and what we are hearing from the market, the demand for this will be quite high. So our expectation, as you will see a strong launch with this drug and I can tell you we have been invested and built an organization, we actually have a very focused group now in our U.S. -- within our U.S. business whose sole job is to manage this launch. And so, I think, we are both prepared from a commercial perspective and from a manufacturing perspective with the expectation, as I said that, this should go with a very strong quick uptake. And the other thing I would highlight is given the strength of the data, we do expect to see approval in Europe next year, which we originally thought would require a further study. So not only are we preparing in the United States, but we are also preparing in Europe as well and we feel good about both. But Caroline, anything you would want to add.\nCaroline Litchfield: No. I think you captured it Rob. Dean, anything you would want to.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. I just want to emphasize sotatercept, this is the first drug out there that really is targeting the fundamental genetic basis of the disease. It\u2019s going to be the first activin inhibitor, but most important is activin is what the genetics tells you imbalance that occurs in pulmonary artery hypertension. So this is a really important and I said watershed previously, I do think this is going to be a watershed moment for PAH. Rob already talked about the U.S. and EU, and the reason why that happened is because of the stellar data was quite impressive and that\u2019s what drove the ability to do EU. What I would remind everyone is that we have other trials coming through. We have Zenith, Hyperion and Cadence. Zenith, for example, is one that\u2019s going to look at mortality and those sort of endpoints, as the primary endpoints. Should that read-out in the next year or something like that, relatively soon to the launch, I think whatever estimates that, Caroline and Rob have talked about sotatercept that will only help the uptake of sotatercept. And as Rob has mentioned, this is a field that up many of the physicians, this was a place where I did research back-in the academic days. The phone calls, I am getting is that people are warehousing patients in anticipation of that March launch.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Louise. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on GARDASIL, we have seen obviously some very impressive growth over the past few years, but looking ahead, I am just interested in how much more opportunity for you see for this franchise to ramp from here. So maybe just elaborate a little bit more on what are the kind of unmet needs at this point, where is the biggest opportunity to do kind of roll-out the product and just, ultimately, how much larger can this franchise become over time? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. Chris, no, I appreciate the question. So, one, I would say, we feel very proud of GARDASIL [Technical Difficulty] of this business and the fact that people increasingly recognize that we can fundamentally do what\u2019s the most important, which is prevent cancer -- prevent cervical cancer, increasingly prevent certain head-and-neck cancers if we can get people fully vaccinated. So the fact that you are starting to see that progress is important. As we look at the business going forward, I would start by saying, we remain very confident that this as a business that\u2019s going to continue to grow and that we will achieve the expectations we have communicated of over $11 billion in revenue by 2030, so nothing has changed and how we see the business. As you know, we have made significant investments in manufacturing capacity and from that perspective now, we are well-positioned, we have brought on our two sites and they are ramping now, and so we are doing quite well from that perspective. And then as far as the opportunities that exist to potentially continue to drive even beyond, what we just discussed, really, I would put it in three buckets and our ability to achieve that objective and then potentially exceed that objective really come down to these three variables. And first and foremost, while we have had great penetration in the developed world, huge opportunity still exists in the low and middle income markets. And I can tell you we have a focus and an intention to drive this business into the low and middle income markets. Obviously, that\u2019s going to require us to continue to drive down our manufacturing costs, which we have plans to do and I have confidence that we will do and just think about lower price points. But that said, that will be meaningful incremental revenue, as we achieve that over time. And then as you look at the established markets, there is still a large population to address. Obviously, to-date we have been driving largely through public vaccination programs outside the United States, in the United States through the national immunization program, primarily aimed at young women and young girls. Increasingly, the opportunity to go to a broader age cohorts, as we think about going now to people aged 45. That ability to move into the mid adult segment is a real opportunity in the United States that continues to be a driver of growth, it\u2019s increasingly going to be a growth driver in Europe and it is currently an important part of why we are driving growth with the recent expansion we got in China and there are more markets to come. So as we look at that, that\u2019s going to be another lever of growth. Obviously, the difference here is this requires consumer activation that takes commercial investments and a lot of heavy lifting. We have demonstrated we can do it like we have started to do in China and as we are starting to do in the United States. But it is going to take a lot of work and investment and we are committed to doing that. So that\u2019s another variable that we look at it. And then, lastly, this is still largely seen as a female vaccine, we only I think it\u2019s only 70 markets have gender neutral approvals. And even in the markets that do have it, particularly if you look at markets like Europe. There is still a real opportunity to increasingly bring people to understand that this is not just a female cancer vaccine, it is a gender neutral cancer vaccine. And with the growing incidence of head-and-neck cancers, which is primarily a male-dominated cancer, we do see real opportunity to continue to push and drive both getting more markets to gender neutral and in the markets, where we have those approvals drive vaccination rates up and probably one more bigger near-term opportunities is to get gender neutral approved in China, which is an opportunity. So across all of those, there\u2019s opportunities and potential. It\u2019s a heavy lift, I don\u2019t want to indicate that it\u2019s going to be easy and we are going to invest behind it. But that really will determine ultimately our success across those variables will determine the success we see long-term with this franchise. But maybe Dean or Caroline, anything you would add.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. I would just emphasize two points. One, directly related to what you said. This is a highly effective vaccine to prevent women\u2019s cancer, cervical cancer and that is something that everyone recognizes, but the gender neutral part is really important and at MRL we are advancing studies and filings in relationship to make sure that as many places that can adopt gender neutral can it -- can be in a position to do gender neutral. I also want to just make one comment about cervical cancer itself. We talk about Carticel in relationship to cervical cancer, but I would also emphasize that at ESMO, we had KEYNOTE-A18. I would remind people that cervical cancer is still the fourth leading cause of women cancer and this was another trial that showed the effect of KEYTRUDA in earlier stage in combination with chemo radiation. So that I think is a PDUFA date that\u2019s coming up and that hopefully might be the 9th early-stage and I believe that PDUFA date is among like four that are coming up in the next six months in relationship to cancer. So Carticel gender neutral, but also cervical cancer being a critical driver and driving into earlier stage. Those are all things that play around what we are trying to do at Merck.\nRob Davis: Thanks for the question, Chris. We have time to take some additional questions and go past the hour. Julie, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, everyone. Thanks for the question. Question for Dean or even Rob on ADCs. So you guys have obviously done a number of deals, have partnered assets and clearly you think this approach is strategically important for Merck. So the question is how much of an investment is Merck making in building out a broader ADC platform in-house. I am just thinking beyond the partner programs, and especially, Dean, as you call out the IO paradigm is shifting earlier? Thank you.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. Thanks for that. I will grab that one. So we have been very lucky to partner with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo and that advances our clinical programs at scale. We also clearly have collaborations with other ADC companies in relationship to KEYTRUDA. So we have a wall of data of understanding what we are hoping that the field might navigate towards. And like everyone has said there will be different antibodies, different antibodies structures to be able to change how one thinks about the tissue targeting component. There will be changes in terms of the linkers and for right now, there are probably two major payloads that people use microtubules based chemotherapy, as well as a TOPO1 based chemotherapy. I would just emphasize that there are only -- there are not just two classes of chemotherapy out there for the last 30 years and each one has a reason why they are there. So we have invested in an ADC platform that is separate, but we will build-off what is learn from our clinical programs both in the ones that we are doing with Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, as well as those that we are doing when we are collaborating with others in relationship with KEYTRUDA. So we have built and we continue to build that expertise within the company and we hope to see those internal programs carrying its clinical head in the next couple of years.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Geoff. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much. What is VAXNEUVANCE\u2019s share in pediatrics now and why hasn\u2019t it seen an inflection in the U.S. sales in line with Merck\u2019s prior comments that it held 30% share of the pediatric market with plans to grow from there. I mean, 30% share of a $6 billion market is a big number and it\u2019s well-ahead of where current sales are landing. So any color would be appreciated? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yeah. Steve, I will maybe jump on that and then others can jump in. But so your answer is we are in that low 30% share both in the public and private market. So that is what you are saying in the quarter. I think the U.S. roughly was about approaching $185 million to $200 million of total business or the products. So we are actually seeing growth pretty much consistent with what we expect and the share we got is pretty much what we expected. So we will have to think through how the disconnect in what you are seeing. But I can tell you, in fact, and we are doing exactly what we expected we would do.\nCaroline Litchfield: This is Caroline. The only thing I\u2019d add to that would be the performance we are also seeing outside of the U.S. So while we are early in our launch outside the U.S., we have gained 50% of the tenders in which we have participated and which being shares north of that one-third, so we are very confident in our ability to continue to drive VAXNEUVANCE and very much looking forward to augmenting our offering with V116 later next year.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. I would just add.\nRob Davis: Steve, let me just clarify one thing, because I think it\u2019s important. I was just reflecting on your question just to clarify my comments. Its 30% is our exit share not overall of the year. So that\u2019s an exit share, as we are seeing the business grow today.\nDr. Dean Li: Yeah. I wanted to just make a comment about VAXNEUVANCE in the setting of what Caroline said about V116. It\u2019s essentially with VAXNEUVANCE and V16, what we are trying to do is to drive the precision medicine mindset to vaccine giving the right vaccine with the right set of serotypes to the right age group at the right time and we believe that that strategy is important for VAXNEUVANCE and to think about VAXNEUVANCE not just on its own, but in relationship to V116 and we have work cut out to us in relationship to a potential approval from the FDA, as well as we will have to speak to the ACIP, as we advance this concept of a precision medicine mindset to pneumococcal vaccination.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Steve. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, all. Thank you so much for taking my question. I want to touch on MK-0616, so clearly prioritizing given the advancement into multiple Phase 3 trials. Maybe talk to me about the importance of an oral PCSK9. Given the dynamics we have seen in the injectable market with both the antibodies and other long-acting assets? Thank you so much.\nDr. Dean Li: Okay. I will take that was and I will give my homage to Helen Hubs and Jonathan Cohen at the UT Southwestern in Dallas Heart Study. That was really important data in relationship to showing PCSK9. And if you look at that patient population, that patient population is desperately in need of an oral potent LDL lowering cholesterol medicine and that\u2019s what we are trying to provide. We are trying to democratize our pathway, such that people whether they are in the rural and the inner city or globally, can get this. And so I would just emphasize the other point, which is cardiovascular disease atherosclerotic disease is still the number one killer in the United States and the developed countries and lowering LDL is known to be important. We used to talk about resistant or refractory, but my experience is that the level of LDL that you are going to have to drive to that increasingly the guidelines are taking is to is forget about whether you are refractory or resistant to stand, it will be very hard with one agents to get your LDL below 70 or below 55 in some patient populations. That patient population, you want to treat you want to have that treatment readily available with no cold-chain and no requirement to go into a hospital system to get it. That\u2019s what we are trying to do and hopefully our data will support such a move.\nRob Davis: Great. Thanks Evan. Maybe final question please, Julie.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal. Your line is open. With Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to touch upon among EGFR mutant patients, how are you thinking about a TROP2 ADC versus a HER3 ADC, because if you look at your data or even EV\u2019s data, it seems like TROP2 seem to be working quite well among those AGA mutations, so how are you thinking about these two ADCs in that same indication?\nDr. Dean Li: I think that\u2019s a great question. I would just answer that. I think the TROP2 ADC data is important to look at, but I would also emphasize that the HER3 ADC program is reasonably advanced in that patient population. And so we will -- we are interested in advancing both in getting the best medicines to the patients as quickly as we can. I do think more as a general statement that the role of biomarkers for some of these ADCs outside of EGFR will be important, relationship to tissue targeting, also in relationship more broadly for ADCs and other combinations. And so we will have to see how that field is moving, but essentially the way I think about ADCs is trying to bring chemotherapy in the precision medicine approach. And with that, we are going to have to find the right patient population, with the right biomarkers to give them the maximum benefit.\nRob Davis: Thank you, Mohit, and thank you all for your time and attention today. Please follow-up with Investor Relations if you have any additional questions and we look forward to being in touch soon. Thank you all very much.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we achieved very strong growth this quarter driven by robust underlying demand across our innovative portfolio and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term. We are also making disciplined investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world well into the future, positioning us to deliver long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered strong growth of 8%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 10%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 17% to $6.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand for metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased utilization in both metastatic indications and earlier stage cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer. Uptake in earlier stages of non-small cell lung cancer remains strong and KEYTRUDA has now achieved brand leadership in this setting, reflecting the significant impact it is having as adjuvant treatment for patients with stage IB to IIIA disease. Our recently approved KEYNOTE-671 indication provides an important additional treatment option to patients and physicians by including usage in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting. We remain exceptionally well positioned to serve patients with non-small cell lung cancer and extend our leadership to the earlier stage setting. In bladder cancer, we are excited to potentially expand usage of KEYTRUDA to cisplatin-eligible patients based on the compelling results from the KEYNOTE-A39 study. If approved, this study would more than double the eligible patient population for KEYTRUDA in first-line bladder cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, as well as increased demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor, with alliance revenue growing 6% this quarter. Lenvima alliance revenue had growth of 30%, driven by shipment timing in China, which we expect will negatively impact growth in the fourth quarter. Growth was also driven by increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S. Our Vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 16% to $2.6 billion, driven by underlying global demand, particularly in China. In the U.S., GARDASIL sales decreased due to CDC purchasing patterns. Vaccine sales also benefited from continued uptake in the pediatric indication of VAXNEUVANCE in the U.S. and its launch in key European markets. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales were flat as increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. was offset by the impact of generic entry in Europe. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales grew 7% reflecting price actions as well as higher demand for ruminant products. Companion animal sales declined due to a reduction in vet visits in the U.S., partially offset by pricing actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 77%, consistent with last year as the impact from unfavorable foreign exchange was offset by product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $5.8 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with $690 million of charges a year ago. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of our robust early and late-phase pipeline, with research and development expenses increasing 17%. Other expense was $133 million. Our tax rate was 15%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.13. Before I cover the outlook for the balance of the year, I wanted to briefly touch upon the recently announced strategic collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. This transaction follows a similar, de-risked and disciplined financial structure as we have employed in prior successful collaborations and we are very excited about the opportunity to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance, which includes the strategic collaboration with Daiichi. The continuing operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $59.7 and $60.2 billion, an increase of approximately $900 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong double-digit underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to 12%, excluding LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2-percentage-point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $39.8 billion and $40.4 billion. This range reflects $17.1 billion in acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses, including $5.5 billion for the collaboration with Daiichi, as well as those associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $200 million, which reflects updated foreign exchange expectations given recent dollar strengthening and higher net interest expense related to Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 39% and 40%, which includes an approximate 24.5-percentage-point impact related to our business development activity. Our underlying tax rate is approximately 14.5% to 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $1.33 to $1.38. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 6 percentage points versus 2022 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $2.95 to $3.05. Including the one-time charge of $5.5 billion or $1.70 per share and an estimated $0.04 to advance the assets and financing costs from the collaboration with Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $1.21 to $1.31, with a midpoint of $1.26. Our current guidance midpoint of $1.36 represents an increase resulting from strength in our business of approximately $0.15, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05. Now turning to capital allocation, where our priorities remain unchanged. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We are proud of the significant progress our team is making to advance and augment our pipeline, including our collaboration with Daiichi. We will continue to invest in our pipeline, which contains many assets with tremendous potential to address significant unmet medical needs, positioning us for strong performance well into the future. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Business development continues to be a high priority. Our track record demonstrates our ability to identify compelling science and technologies that have the potential to advance standard-of-care, access such opportunities in a disciplined and capital-efficient manner, and importantly, to rapidly progress the opportunities for the benefit of the patients we serve and our shareholders. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we finish the year, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business in the near- and long-term, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and Vaccines and our exceptional pipeline. We are in a position of financial and operational strength and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. The only thing I'd add, Rob, is to your point, we have made tremendous progress. We think this year we will have 20% of our KEYTRUDA business coming from the earlier stage cancer setting. And as we move forward given the tremendous state we have had and indications coming, we are really excited about the opportunities of further growth in lung, in potentially bladder and many other indications. Seamus, thank you for the question. We have seen really strong margin expansion in our company over the last several years, and as we look-forward, we expect continued margin expansion and that margin expansion really comes from the product mix on the revenue line, it also comes from the roll-off of royalties, as you have just noted, knowing that we have the royalty on global KEYTRUDA sales going from 6.5% to 2.5% at the start of next year and our royalty on GARDASIL going from 7% to zero percent on our global sales, again, at the start of next year will drive significant gross margin improvement. At the same time, we will be investing in our business. We will be disciplined in that investment, but we are investing in the portfolio of products that we have in the market and that we will be launching, as well as investing in our robust and growing pipeline and that obviously includes the Daiichi collaboration, where we have noticed we expect about a $0.25 impact as a result of investing predominantly in the research and development of a wide range of programs, that Dean has partially outlined, as well as this financing costs. We also have made significant progress across our pipelines with many other collaborations, acquisition and the progress we are making with our own internal assets. So, altogether, we still do point to an operating margin of greater than 43% in the year 2025. However, we will not forgo necessary investments in our business to progress our pipeline to ensure that we have advance healthcare and drive growth, which really is our priority. No. I think you captured it Rob. Dean, anything you would want to. This is Caroline. The only thing I'd add to that would be the performance we are also seeing outside of the U.S. So while we are early in our launch outside the U.S., we have gained 50% of the tenders in which we have participated and which being shares north of that one-third, so we are very confident in our ability to continue to drive VAXNEUVANCE and very much looking forward to augmenting our offering with V116 later next year."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning and thank you for joining today's call. We continue to bring forward innovation that can save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world. We are advancing our broad pipeline and executing in support of our key growth drivers, enabling strong progress for our business and providing tangible benefits to patients. To that end, I want to acknowledge the efforts of our talented global team. Their passion and commitment to our science-led strategy are fundamental to our continued success. Scientific innovation is truly the foundation of our strategy and it drives everything we do. We are pushing the boundaries of science through the significant investments we are making across our deep pipeline augmented by strategic business development. I am pleased by the continued progress with these programs and our growing diversity across new therapeutic areas and modalities. Along these lines, we are particularly excited by our recently announced clinical and commercial collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo for three potentially first-in-class antibody drug conjugates. The scientists at Daiichi Sankyo are proven innovators in this space, having developed proprietary ADC technology that has resulted in an approved product, which is being rapidly adopted for patients with certain cancers. We are privileged to begin working alongside them to advance this important science and achieve both companies' objectives of addressing the significant unmet patient need in oncology. Based on our strong conviction in these programs and the profound benefit they may bring to patients, we believe each has multi-billion dollar commercial revenue potential for Merck on a non-risk adjusted basis approaching the mid-2030s. We are also applying our clinical expertise to accelerate the development of other potentially transformative treatments that we have added through strategic business development, such as sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension and MK-7240, our TL1A inhibitor for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. This is complemented by our strong commercial execution capabilities, which we expect to amplify the impact of these life changing medicines and enable the creation of sustainable value for patients and shareholders over the long-term. Turning to this quarter's performance. We delivered robust growth driven by demand for our innovative portfolio. We are confident that we will close out 2023 with continued strong performance, which is reflected in the updated full year outlook that Caroline will speak to in a few minutes. Moving to our research organization, as I mentioned, we are making remarkable progress across multiple therapeutic areas in our promising late-phase pipeline. In oncology, Dean will speak to the significant success we are having in broadly leveraging, the foundational position that we have achieved with KEYTRUDA. This includes the continued advancements we are making in the treatment of earlier stage cancers. We are very excited by the recent FDA approval of a KEYTRUDA regimen for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of certain patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on the KEYNOTE-671 trial results, which notably demonstrated an improvement in overall survival compared to a placebo and chemotherapy regimen. In addition, we presented numerous important datasets at last week's European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, across a wide range of molecules, tumor types and indications. Our progress across a broad set of programs reinforces our confidence in the sustainability of our oncology leadership well into the next decade. We are also making exciting progress in our cardiometabolic pipeline. Most significantly, the FDA accepted for priority review our filing for sotatercept based on the unprecedented results of the STELLAR trial and we look forward to the potential approval and launch in early 2024. We remain confident that sotatercept has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We also initiated Phase 3 clinical trials for our oral PCSK9 candidate, MK-0616. We believe MK-0616 has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients with elevated cholesterol and impact cardiovascular disease on a global scale. We are very pleased with our progress and what we have achieved this quarter, as we continue to focus on advancing and expanding Merck's pipeline and I want to thank Dean and his team for their unwavering commitment to addressing unmet patient needs. In summary, we continue to move with urgency to deliver on our purpose, pursuing transformative science to save and improve lives around the world. We are executing scientifically, commercially and operationally on the significant opportunities now in front of us, while also making the disciplined investments needed to sustain strong growth well into the future. With the efforts of our global team, we have increased confidence that we will deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders. With that, I will turn the call over to Caroline. Great, Chris. This is Rob and I will maybe start and Dean or Caroline can jump-in if they would like. But first and foremost, I appreciate the comments and as we sit here today, Dean, made reference to it, we feel very good about the progress we have made over the last couple of years through the assets we brought in. You mentioned cardiometabolic, but also immunology, the progress we are making to broaden our position in Oncology and I will get to you in a moment, but as you mentioned the durable growth drivers we have with Vaccines and Animal Health. But specifically to the cardiometabolic area, I can tell you that today as we sit here and just to remind people what we had commented on in the past, we have said, based on both what we received through the acquisition of Acceleron plus other programs that we have been developing internally, we expected that we could be in a position to have greater than $10 billion of revenue potential in the mid-2030s and I'd remind everyone that was on a risk-adjusted basis. But I would tell you as we sit here today, given what we have seen with the remarkable data from STELLAR, the excitement that is coming and we are seeing from key opinion leaders, with the potential launch of sotatercept hopefully early next year and approval even in Europe next year, our confidence that we will achieve that $10 plus billion is higher today than it was when we made the original comment. So we feel very good, doesn't mean we feel like we are done, but we feel very good about the progress. And then as you reflected on Animal Health. We continue to see the Animal Health business as an important business for us, it a durable growth driver. As we look forward, it continues to be a business that we think will be accretive to our growth long-term and it has strategic value to us, where we are both benefiting from the synergies that it brings to us and that it benefits from the synergies coming from the science that we have on the Human Health side. So as we sit here today, we remain committed that it is the strategic part of the company. But as I have often said, that's not a philosophical view that is unchanged, it's something we are very objective about and we look out regularly. But I can tell you as we have continued to look at it, our view has not changed. Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question please, Julie. Yeah. The short answer, Mara, is we are ahead of our -- of where we thought we would be. And just to remind everyone, we have been commenting that we expect 50% of our growth to come from movement into the earlier stages of disease in oncology, as we look forward to ultimately get to a global percent with it being about 25% of our total revenues. But I can tell you as where we sit here today, we are tracking ahead of where we expected we would be. And obviously not surprising when you see just a phenomenal results from KEYNOTE-671, what that's going to mean in the perioperative space for people in early-stage lung cancer building on 091, the continued strength we are seeing across adjuvant and RCC and melanoma, we are up now to eight approvals in this space. So we are in a very good position. But I may about ask Caroline if she has anything she would like to add. Great. Thank you, Mara. Next question please, Julie. Thank you, Carter. Next question please, Julie. Great. Thank you, Seamus. Next question please. Julie. Thanks, Terrence. Next question please, Julie. Thanks, Andrew. Next question please, Julie. Yeah. Louise, this is Rob. I will maybe jump-in and Caroline can add if I miss anything. I would tell you that we feel well-prepared. So, obviously, we have been working to ensure we have supply to be able to supply the market upon launch. But as we sit here today, given what is happening in the marketplace. So you are seeing warehousing of patients in anticipation of the launch of sotatercept in the United States. And from feedback from key opinion leaders and what we are hearing from the market, the demand for this will be quite high. So our expectation, as you will see a strong launch with this drug and I can tell you we have been invested and built an organization, we actually have a very focused group now in our U.S. -- within our U.S. business whose sole job is to manage this launch. And so, I think, we are both prepared from a commercial perspective and from a manufacturing perspective with the expectation, as I said that, this should go with a very strong quick uptake. And the other thing I would highlight is given the strength of the data, we do expect to see approval in Europe next year, which we originally thought would require a further study. So not only are we preparing in the United States, but we are also preparing in Europe as well and we feel good about both. But Caroline, anything you would want to add. Thanks, Louise. Next question please. Thanks for the question, Chris. We have time to take some additional questions and go past the hour. Julie, next question please. Thanks, Geoff. Next question please. Yeah. Steve, I will maybe jump on that and then others can jump in. But so your answer is we are in that low 30% share both in the public and private market. So that is what you are saying in the quarter. I think the U.S. roughly was about approaching $185 million to $200 million of total business or the products. So we are actually seeing growth pretty much consistent with what we expect and the share we got is pretty much what we expected. So we will have to think through how the disconnect in what you are seeing. But I can tell you, in fact, and we are doing exactly what we expected we would do. Steve, let me just clarify one thing, because I think it's important. I was just reflecting on your question just to clarify my comments. Its 30% is our exit share not overall of the year. So that's an exit share, as we are seeing the business grow today. Thanks, Steve. Next question please. Great. Thanks Evan. Maybe final question please, Julie. Thank you, Mohit, and thank you all for your time and attention today. Please follow-up with Investor Relations if you have any additional questions and we look forward to being in touch soon. Thank you all very much."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Dr. Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will start with our oncology programs followed by vaccines, immunology and conclude with cardiometabolic disease. Over the last few years, our oncology strategy has focused on leveraging the remarkable properties of KEYTRUDA to establish a diverse clinical pipeline of candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities. This is broadly based on three strategic pillars, immuno-oncology, precision oncology and tissue targeting. In immuno-oncology, we continue to evaluate KEYTRUDA in the metastatic and increasingly in earlier stage disease settings, while also investigating multiple novel immuno-oncology combinations and coformulations. With precision oncology, we are selectively targeting pathways to inhibit cancer cell growth. And in tissue targeting, we are developing agents such as antibody-drug conjugates designed to increase cancer cell sensitivity and killing. The latter is exemplified by our recently announced collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Daiichi Sankyo scientists have made pioneering contributions in advancing novel antibody drug conjugate technology with proven benefit to patients. By combining our companies' respective strengths, we are well-positioned to accelerate three clinical stage potentially first-in-class candidates with the goal of transforming the treatment paradigm. These include, Patritumab deruxtecan, an investigational fully humanized anti-HER3 ADC, in Phase 3, Ifinatamab deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti-B7-H3 ADC in Phase 2 and Raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational humanized anti CDH6 targeted ADC in Phase 1. We provided details during our investor event earlier this week and are eager to begin working with the team. The Daiichi Sankyo collaboration complements our important, ongoing alliance with Kelun Biotech, whose talented scientists have developed their own innovative ADC platform. At ESMO, new Phase 2 data for MK-2870 or SKB-264, a TROP-2 targeting ADC, in patients with previously treated metastatic, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, showed encouraging anti-tumor activity with an objective response rate of 36.8%. This builds on existing data for MK-2870 both in triple-negative breast and non-small cell lung cancer. We are now poised to initiate larger studies starting with non-small cell lung cancer and expand into additional tumor types. We are also advancing clinical development of MK-1200, an ADC targeting Claudin 18.2. Recognizing the proven benefit of KEYTRUDA, in combination with chemotherapy in certain tumor types, we are exploring the tissue-targeting concept by evaluating regimens combining ADCs and immunotherapy. At ESMO, in collaboration with Seagen and Astellas, potentially practice-changing survival data were presented from KEYNOTE-A39/EV-302, evaluating KEYTRUDA plus enfortumab vedotin as first-line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. This regimen represents the first approval of a combination of a checkpoint inhibitor and an ADC. Turning to immuno-oncology. Evidence continues to emerge for the benefit of KEYTRUDA in the treatment of earlier stage cancer. Positive survival data from KEYNOTE-671 evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer compared to pre-operative chemotherapy were presented at ESMO, further reinforcing the benefit of routine lung cancer screening for certain populations to enable early intervention. Based on the KEYNOTE-671 results, last week the FDA approved this indication with a differentiated label that includes overall survival. KEYTRUDA has now been approved for six indications to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer. KEYNOTE-671 represents the eighth approval for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage cancer. Positive data from additional earlier stage studies in women's cancers were also presented at ESMO for KEYNOTE-756 in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, for KEYNOTE-522 in high-risk early-stage triple negative breast cancer, and KEYNOTE-A18 for patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. The FDA recently granted priority review for KEYTRUDA based upon this study with a target action date of January 20th. We also announced KEYTRUDA significantly improved disease-free-survival for the adjuvant treatment of patients with localized muscle-invasive and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma based on KEYNOTE-123. And finally, in collaboration with Moderna, the Phase 3 trial for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an individualized neoantigen therapy, in earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer has now been posted and is poised to start soon. In precision oncology, our efforts continue to yield progress. WELIREG, our HIF 2 alpha inhibitor, is approved for treatment of certain cancers in patients with von Hippel Lindau Disease, a rare cancer-prone genetic disorder. Studies evaluating WELIREG in broader populations of patients whose tumors display analogous genetic underpinnings are ongoing. Data presented at ESMO from LITESPARK-005 evaluating WELIREG for adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma following immune checkpoint and anti-angiogenic therapies showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival versus the standard-of-care. These findings support our supplemental new drug application for WELIREG, which was granted priority review by the FDA with a target action date of January 17th. Additional Phase 3 studies in combination with KEYTRUDA and/or lenvatinib in advanced and adjuvant renal cell carcinoma are proceeding. First-time safety and preliminary efficacy data for MK-1084, our oral KRAS inhibitor both as monotherapy in patients with solid tumors and in combination with KEYTRUDA for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors harbored KRAS G12C mutations were presented at ESMO. Notably, the combination arm showed a compelling objective response rate of 71%. While the data are early, we are encouraged by the potential to combine MK-1084 with KEYTRUDA. In the hematologic space, we will begin enrolling patients in our Phase 3 study evaluating MK-3543 or bomedemstat, as second line treatment for essential thrombocythemia, an area with tremendous patient need. Bomedemstat is derived from our acquisition of Imago. Outside of the U.S., the European Union granted approval for KEYTRUDA for adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are at high risk of recurrence following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-091. And for KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with certain gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma based on KEYNOTE-811. In Japan, Lynparza, in combination with abiraterone and prednisone was approved for BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with distant metastasis based on the PROpel study. Now to our broader pipeline. Building on the ongoing launch of VAXNEUVANCE, which Caroline mentioned, progress continues in our population-focused pneumococcal conjugate vaccine program. V116, our investigational pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults has demonstrated a robust immune response to all 21 serotypes in the STRIDE-3 and STRIDE-6 studies. Detailed findings from the STRIDE-3 study will be presented at the World Vaccine Congress West Coast in November. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address serotypes responsible for the majority of adult invasive pneumococcal disease in adults. Our company has deep expertise, given our breadth and depth of knowledge both in immuno-oncology and vaccines. We are leveraging these capabilities in immunology, where the first patient is ready to be enrolled in the Phase 3 trial for MK-7240 in ulcerative colitis. Turning to cardiometabolic disease programs. Last month at the European Respiratory Society International Congress, we presented data for sotatercept, currently under review by the FDA for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In an exploratory post-hoc analysis of right heart catheterization and echocardiography data from patients in the Phase 3 STELLAR study, patients with PAH treated with sotatercept for 24 weeks on top of background therapy showed a reduction in right heart size and improved right-ventricular function and hemodynamic status. In addition, we presented promising data from an analysis of the Phase 3 SOTERIA open-label extension study in PAH. The results support the potential long-term durability of the response to sotatercept and represent the longest safety and efficacy analysis for this compound to-date. Given the serious patient need in pulmonary arterial hypertension, our regulatory and clinical teams worked swiftly to submit the necessary regulatory filings for sotatercept. The FDA has accepted the Biologics License Application under priority review with a target action date of March 26th. In addition, the submission to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the European Union has been completed. Also in cardiology, momentum continues in the clinical development program for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor. We have initiated the CORALreef Lipids study in a broad patient population and CORALreef Outcomes, a randomized, double-blinded study, evaluating the efficacy of MK-0616 with respect to major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, as well as a separate CORALreef study in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Over the last three years, we have moved with rigor and urgency to advance the best science while carefully coordinating our efforts internally and externally. We have and continue to leverage the foundational properties of KEYTRUDA while adding promising candidates with novel mechanisms and modalities in oncology. At the same time, we have expanded in our focused areas of excellence to establish a diverse pipeline of promising candidates spanning multiple additional disease areas. We understand there is still work to be done, but the tangible advances we are making underscore our purpose of creating innovative medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives. And now I turn the call back to Peter. I would just add one thing, Chris, in relationship to your question, but not related to revenues or finance. I would just remind that we have made incredible advances in cancer and we are known as an oncology company. But the unmet need -- the unmet patient needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in the U.S. and in the world is quite substantial, and I don't know that we are ever going to be done with that field in the near-term, so we are still very committed to do more. Yeah. I just want to make as a call out, because we had an investor discussion this past Sunday and we are really focused on the ADC and Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, but I just want to call out that for me KEYNOTE-671 is a watershed moment for the field. I would remind everyone that a similar watershed happened in metastatic lung cancer in 2018 KEYNOTE-189 and 2018 is when KEYNOTE-671 was initiated. It's an earlier stage and only after 5.5 years, after only 5.5 years in an earlier stage trial, you have clear evidence of EFS and OS benefit and I really think this will catalyze a change in how we treat early-stage lung cancer, how we detect early lung cancer and how we screen. If you think about treating early those patients with Stage 2 and 3, you can reduce their mortality by 28%. I think it will catalyze people really looking at any one going to surgery in Stage 2 and 3, not just in Stage 3, people are going to have to think very carefully of why someone should get this regimen. In terms of detecting early, I think it's really important. How many individuals have a chest CT or chest x-ray with incidental findings and there's little follow-up and day and age of electronic health records, it's very easy to figure out how many people have incidental nodules that never got followed up. I think that will change. And I think in screening, early we have guidelines, where the adherence is only 6% to 7% and these guidelines were set four, five years ago, where the concept was it would reduce mortality by 20%. With these data that we have, that number is no longer at 20%, it's much lower. And so, I think there will be a push by the American Cancer Society, NCCN, NCI, NIH to simplify and broaden those guidelines, because that is -- this is the inexorable march of IO into earlier stage and into the most important cancer, which is lung cancer, which is the number one cause of death for women and the number one cause for men and our commitment to this field is not just 671 and 91, it is also as we highlighted our interest of moving INT the individualized neoantigen therapy into earlier stage in lung cancer. Yeah. Specifically to any ADC that we would advance in any tissue tumor type, one thinks about monotherapy and one thinks about a clear indication and a line of sight, but one also thinks about how the field develops and in combinations and those combinations can be with PD -1s, but I would also highlight, it can be with chemo, it can be RAS, it can be with novel hormonal agents, it can be with PAR, it can be with other ADCs and you have to think from late and earlier. In relationship to TROP2, specifically in non-small cell lung cancer, I believe that I have said in the past that, one has to think about how the field has evolved, there was a watershed moment, it was KEYNOTE-189 and pembro plus chemo in a broad patient population along that indication do really well. So those of us who want to advance, what I would say, in ADC and NextGen chemo, that's how I think about it, have to think about a way to combine it with PD-1 in a way that is not just effective, but substantially effective over KEYNOTE-189. We are very interested in advancing our TROP2 ADC in relationship to that and that combination, like all chemotherapy based treatments, whether it's chemotherapy or whether it's chemotherapy on a payload with ADC, one has to think about adverse effects and combinatorial adverse effects and the ability to keep patients on the medicines. The data that we have shown with our partner, our valued partner Kelun is that we think that there is room to be able to advance MK-2870 and PD-1 in a variety of tumors and that they are combinable, tolerable and will be effective, but those are the trials that we are starting to do in Phase 3 in the ex-China regulatory arena. Yeah. So I just want to make sure that whether we are talking about our wonderful partnership with Kelun or with Daiichi Sankyo, we sort of lay out certainly indications that become public, but I want to be very clear that those are not the only indications that we would be interested. So that's number one. Number two, in relationship to MK-2870 and advancing it more broadly and it relates to the other question, there is -- we still have small numbers, but what's really interesting for us for 2870, there are differences in the construct in terms of payload, in terms of the linker, in terms of the dart for that. And one of the things that's interesting to us is at least to-date, we do not see serious IOD and that allows us to think broadly and thoughtfully about its combined ability in relationship to broader indications. So we are very interested in advancing. In terms of 2870 and the specific first trial that's been revealed, it's -- I will just tell you, it was driven, because of the data that we have and the data that we have we think is quite good and should be advanced. We are going to advance other ones, but the advancement in the EGFR new population is based on data that our partners Kelun and us have generated and we are very confident in advancing in that specific indication. I would just say that in general principle, your observations of how we develop drugs, especially in the IO has been something that we are known for and the structure was laid out by great leaders from Merck, who laid the basis for that. In relationship to timing of interim analysis, we have generally not commented on interim analysis and we let those interim analysis do what they need to do, which is come and if they are significant, we make that publicly known. If there is significance in relationship to public disclosure, that's when we do that, but we generally do not lay out the timing of our interim analysis prior to them happening. Yeah. I just want to emphasize sotatercept, this is the first drug out there that really is targeting the fundamental genetic basis of the disease. It's going to be the first activin inhibitor, but most important is activin is what the genetics tells you imbalance that occurs in pulmonary artery hypertension. So this is a really important and I said watershed previously, I do think this is going to be a watershed moment for PAH. Rob already talked about the U.S. and EU, and the reason why that happened is because of the stellar data was quite impressive and that's what drove the ability to do EU. What I would remind everyone is that we have other trials coming through. We have Zenith, Hyperion and Cadence. Zenith, for example, is one that's going to look at mortality and those sort of endpoints, as the primary endpoints. Should that read-out in the next year or something like that, relatively soon to the launch, I think whatever estimates that, Caroline and Rob have talked about sotatercept that will only help the uptake of sotatercept. And as Rob has mentioned, this is a field that up many of the physicians, this was a place where I did research back-in the academic days. The phone calls, I am getting is that people are warehousing patients in anticipation of that March launch. Yeah. Chris, no, I appreciate the question. So, one, I would say, we feel very proud of GARDASIL [Technical Difficulty] of this business and the fact that people increasingly recognize that we can fundamentally do what's the most important, which is prevent cancer -- prevent cervical cancer, increasingly prevent certain head-and-neck cancers if we can get people fully vaccinated. So the fact that you are starting to see that progress is important. As we look at the business going forward, I would start by saying, we remain very confident that this as a business that's going to continue to grow and that we will achieve the expectations we have communicated of over $11 billion in revenue by 2030, so nothing has changed and how we see the business. As you know, we have made significant investments in manufacturing capacity and from that perspective now, we are well-positioned, we have brought on our two sites and they are ramping now, and so we are doing quite well from that perspective. And then as far as the opportunities that exist to potentially continue to drive even beyond, what we just discussed, really, I would put it in three buckets and our ability to achieve that objective and then potentially exceed that objective really come down to these three variables. And first and foremost, while we have had great penetration in the developed world, huge opportunity still exists in the low and middle income markets. And I can tell you we have a focus and an intention to drive this business into the low and middle income markets. Obviously, that's going to require us to continue to drive down our manufacturing costs, which we have plans to do and I have confidence that we will do and just think about lower price points. But that said, that will be meaningful incremental revenue, as we achieve that over time. And then as you look at the established markets, there is still a large population to address. Obviously, to-date we have been driving largely through public vaccination programs outside the United States, in the United States through the national immunization program, primarily aimed at young women and young girls. Increasingly, the opportunity to go to a broader age cohorts, as we think about going now to people aged 45. That ability to move into the mid adult segment is a real opportunity in the United States that continues to be a driver of growth, it's increasingly going to be a growth driver in Europe and it is currently an important part of why we are driving growth with the recent expansion we got in China and there are more markets to come. So as we look at that, that's going to be another lever of growth. Obviously, the difference here is this requires consumer activation that takes commercial investments and a lot of heavy lifting. We have demonstrated we can do it like we have started to do in China and as we are starting to do in the United States. But it is going to take a lot of work and investment and we are committed to doing that. So that's another variable that we look at it. And then, lastly, this is still largely seen as a female vaccine, we only I think it's only 70 markets have gender neutral approvals. And even in the markets that do have it, particularly if you look at markets like Europe. There is still a real opportunity to increasingly bring people to understand that this is not just a female cancer vaccine, it is a gender neutral cancer vaccine. And with the growing incidence of head-and-neck cancers, which is primarily a male-dominated cancer, we do see real opportunity to continue to push and drive both getting more markets to gender neutral and in the markets, where we have those approvals drive vaccination rates up and probably one more bigger near-term opportunities is to get gender neutral approved in China, which is an opportunity. So across all of those, there's opportunities and potential. It's a heavy lift, I don't want to indicate that it's going to be easy and we are going to invest behind it. But that really will determine ultimately our success across those variables will determine the success we see long-term with this franchise. But maybe Dean or Caroline, anything you would add. Yeah. I would just emphasize two points. One, directly related to what you said. This is a highly effective vaccine to prevent women's cancer, cervical cancer and that is something that everyone recognizes, but the gender neutral part is really important and at MRL we are advancing studies and filings in relationship to make sure that as many places that can adopt gender neutral can it -- can be in a position to do gender neutral. I also want to just make one comment about cervical cancer itself. We talk about Carticel in relationship to cervical cancer, but I would also emphasize that at ESMO, we had KEYNOTE-A18. I would remind people that cervical cancer is still the fourth leading cause of women cancer and this was another trial that showed the effect of KEYTRUDA in earlier stage in combination with chemo radiation. So that I think is a PDUFA date that's coming up and that hopefully might be the 9th early-stage and I believe that PDUFA date is among like four that are coming up in the next six months in relationship to cancer. So Carticel gender neutral, but also cervical cancer being a critical driver and driving into earlier stage. Those are all things that play around what we are trying to do at Merck. Yeah. Thanks for that. I will grab that one. So we have been very lucky to partner with Kelun and Daiichi Sankyo and that advances our clinical programs at scale. We also clearly have collaborations with other ADC companies in relationship to KEYTRUDA. So we have a wall of data of understanding what we are hoping that the field might navigate towards. And like everyone has said there will be different antibodies, different antibodies structures to be able to change how one thinks about the tissue targeting component. There will be changes in terms of the linkers and for right now, there are probably two major payloads that people use microtubules based chemotherapy, as well as a TOPO1 based chemotherapy. I would just emphasize that there are only -- there are not just two classes of chemotherapy out there for the last 30 years and each one has a reason why they are there. So we have invested in an ADC platform that is separate, but we will build-off what is learn from our clinical programs both in the ones that we are doing with Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun, as well as those that we are doing when we are collaborating with others in relationship with KEYTRUDA. So we have built and we continue to build that expertise within the company and we hope to see those internal programs carrying its clinical head in the next couple of years. Yeah. I would just add. Yeah. I wanted to just make a comment about VAXNEUVANCE in the setting of what Caroline said about V116. It's essentially with VAXNEUVANCE and V16, what we are trying to do is to drive the precision medicine mindset to vaccine giving the right vaccine with the right set of serotypes to the right age group at the right time and we believe that that strategy is important for VAXNEUVANCE and to think about VAXNEUVANCE not just on its own, but in relationship to V116 and we have work cut out to us in relationship to a potential approval from the FDA, as well as we will have to speak to the ACIP, as we advance this concept of a precision medicine mindset to pneumococcal vaccination. Okay. I will take that was and I will give my homage to Helen Hubs and Jonathan Cohen at the UT Southwestern in Dallas Heart Study. That was really important data in relationship to showing PCSK9. And if you look at that patient population, that patient population is desperately in need of an oral potent LDL lowering cholesterol medicine and that's what we are trying to provide. We are trying to democratize our pathway, such that people whether they are in the rural and the inner city or globally, can get this. And so I would just emphasize the other point, which is cardiovascular disease atherosclerotic disease is still the number one killer in the United States and the developed countries and lowering LDL is known to be important. We used to talk about resistant or refractory, but my experience is that the level of LDL that you are going to have to drive to that increasingly the guidelines are taking is to is forget about whether you are refractory or resistant to stand, it will be very hard with one agents to get your LDL below 70 or below 55 in some patient populations. That patient population, you want to treat you want to have that treatment readily available with no cold-chain and no requirement to go into a hospital system to get it. That's what we are trying to do and hopefully our data will support such a move. I think that's a great question. I would just answer that. I think the TROP2 ADC data is important to look at, but I would also emphasize that the HER3 ADC program is reasonably advanced in that patient population. And so we will -- we are interested in advancing both in getting the best medicines to the patients as quickly as we can. I do think more as a general statement that the role of biomarkers for some of these ADCs outside of EGFR will be important, relationship to tissue targeting, also in relationship more broadly for ADCs and other combinations. And so we will have to see how that field is moving, but essentially the way I think about ADCs is trying to bring chemotherapy in the precision medicine approach. And with that, we are going to have to find the right patient population, with the right biomarkers to give them the maximum benefit."

These slides, along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today\u2019s call. We continue to make great progress in bringing forward compelling science to help address the world\u2019s most urgent unmet medical needs. Thanks to the unwavering commitment and discipline of our global teams, we\u2019re advancing our innovative pipeline and executing operationally in support of our key growth drivers. Our science-led strategy is generating innovations that save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world and is delivering strong underlying growth for our business. We\u2019re building on our strong track record and advancing our strategic priorities. We\u2019re progressing our deep pipeline, including sotatercept for which we have completed our FDA submission, and augmenting it with further strategic business development where we can add value by applying our clinical expertise and leveraging our global scale to accelerate broad access to patients. An excellent example of this is our acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences, which we completed in June. We\u2019re now actively integrating the talented team and are moving with speed toward initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial. The addition of Prometheus significantly strengthens our presence in immunology, an area with substantial unmet medical need and builds on the significant scientific insight we have gained in immuno-oncology. It also brings us a potential first-in-class, best-in-class novel TL1A inhibitor, which provides us the opportunity to transform the standard of care in a patient population suffering from debilitating immune-mediated diseases with a foundation of great science and a legacy of commercial excellence, we\u2019re well-positioned to deliver sustainable value over the long-term. Focusing now on the short-term. We delivered strong underlying growth, excluding the year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales, led by robust demand across key growth drivers in Oncology and Vaccines. We remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will address in a moment. Moving to our research organization, our promising late-stage pipeline continues to demonstrate tangible and impactful benefits for patients across a broad range of diseases. In oncology, we highlighted data from our expansive pipeline at ASCO, including for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage lung cancer. The strong results of KEYNOTE-671 for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer support our aspiration to fundamentally shift the way cancer is managed by developing treatment regimens in the earlier stage setting, where the potential for better outcomes is higher. Additionally, we\u2019re leveraging KEYTRUDA\u2019s wide-reaching benefit across a range of cancer types to identify and bring forward promising new candidates. At ASCO, we shared positive data for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, our investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna, in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. And promising data was also presented by our partner Kelun Biotech for MK-2870, our TROP-2 ADC in non-small cell lung cancer. Each of these novel candidates offer a glimpse into the future of cancer care and the potential to meaningfully improve outcomes for patients. We have also made progress outside of oncology. We\u2019re advancing our population specific approach to pneumococcal vaccination and are very pleased to have announced positive topline results for our adult vaccine candidate V116. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults. And Dean will speak to our progress in cardiometabolic disease including positive data we recently presented for our GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist. I commend Dean and his team on the significant work being done to advance our broad pipeline and their commitment to Merck\u2019s purpose. Innovation is the core of who Merck is and it\u2019s what our company strives to achieve every day. We\u2019re grounded in the relentless pursuit of advancing science and raising the bar of innovation to deliver value for patients. With that in mind, I\u2018d like to speak for a moment about the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ve consistently communicated our support for elements of the law that improve patient affordability and access, such as the Medicare Part D reform, but which do so without damaging the very promising long-term innovation potential of the biopharmaceutical industry. Through the complaint we recently filed in U.S. District Court, Merck is taking a principled stand against the negative long-term impacts of the price negotiation provision of the IRA which we believe amounts to unconstitutional price setting that violates several provisions of the U.S. Constitution. This misguided policy does not strike the right balance between incenting investment in innovation and improving affordability and access. That said, we remain committed to working with the U.S. government to find a better approach to improve affordability and access while protecting further drug breakthroughs that benefit patients facing unmet medical needs. We know it is critical that we provide broad access both to our current portfolio of medicines and vaccines, and to our future innovations, in order to serve the greatest number of patients possible, now and for years to come. Our upcoming annual Impact Report will highlight accomplishments across our four priority areas, including access to health, where a portion of employee compensation will now be driven by metrics linked to our progress. In summary, our science-led strategy is working. We\u2019re driving significant scientific, commercial and operational momentum which we expect will enable strong full-year growth. I want to thank our talented, dedicated and diverse global team for their hard work and commitment to delivering value for patients, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With these efforts, I\u2019m confident we will continue to drive sustainable success well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another very strong quarter, with underlying growth driven by demand across our innovative portfolio. These results reflect the profound impact of our medicines and vaccines globally and reinforce the confidence we have in the health of our business, and in the outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $15 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong growth of 14%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 17%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2% across both companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the second quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $6.3 billion driven by increased utilization from approvals in earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from usage in earlier-stage cancers including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We are encouraged by the positive feedback from healthcare providers and initial uptake of KEYNOTE-091, reflecting the significant impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer, as well as in earlier-stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, which saw continued uptake in recently launched markets. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 15% driven by increased demand in certain international markets. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 6% due to increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales in China. Our vaccines portfolio delivered exceptional growth, led by GARDASIL, which grew 53% to $2.5 billion. Performance was driven by strong global demand, especially in China, where we are benefitting from the expanded indication of GARDASIL 9 for girls and women 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from increased uptake of VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 19%, driven by increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales growth reflects price actions as well as higher demand for swine and poultry products, partially offset by lower demand for ruminant products, due in part to reduced herd sizes. Companion animal growth reflects price actions, including for the BRAVECTO line of products partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.6%, an increase of 1.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $15.9 billion, including a $10.2 billion one-time charge related to the acquisition of Prometheus. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 10%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of near-term opportunities for our in-line portfolio and disciplined investments for the future as we advance our exciting early and late-phase pipeline. Other income was $19 million. Our tax provision was approximately $800 million. As a result of the Prometheus one-time charge, we had a pre-tax loss this quarter. This one-time charge is not tax deductible. Our tax rate is therefore a negative 18.4%. Taken together, we reported a loss of $2.06 per share, which includes a negative impact of $4.02 per share from the one-time charge related to the Prometheus transaction. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.6 and $59.6 billion, an increase of $800 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 10% to 11%, offset by the expected lower sales of LAGEVRIO, which we continue to estimate to be approximately $1 billion this year, and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $34 billion and $34.6 billion. This range includes $11.6 billion of acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $100 million, which includes incremental financing costs related to Prometheus. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, reflecting an increase due to the Prometheus transaction of approximately 15 percentage points. We continue to assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $2.95 to $3.05, which includes the one-time charge for Prometheus and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 5 percentage points versus 2022, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $6.88 to $7, which we noted at the time excluded Prometheus. Had we included the $4.02 one-time charge and an estimated $0.14 to advance the assets and financing costs, our prior guidance range would have been $2.72 to $2.84 with a midpoint of $2.78. Our current guidance midpoint of $3 represents an increase resulting from the strength in our business of approximately $0.24, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.02. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the strength of our business driven by our key pillars, enabling us to deliver robust underlying growth while investing in our promising pipeline. As you consider your models, there are a couple of items to keep in mind. KEYTRUDA growth has been exceptional in recent quarters, outperforming our expectations, driven in part by robust uptake of recently launched earlier stage indications. We continue to expect strong year-over-year growth of KEYTRUDA, but not quite at the levels experienced in recent quarters, as a result of lapping launches and the impact of continued pricing headwinds, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets. In addition, there was a small benefit from wholesaler purchase timing in the U.S. in the second quarter, which we expect to reverse in the third quarter. As we look out to 2024 and beyond, we continue to expect strong growth including the impact of additional approvals. And as a reminder, while we expect the pace of growth of GARDASIL to be higher in 2023 than 2022, the rate of second half growth is anticipated to be below the first half, due in part to the timing of shipments to China. Now turning to capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. Business development remains a priority. We remain well positioned to pursue the most compelling external science through value enhancing business development to augment our pipeline. We continue to expect to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, we remain very confident in both, the strength of our underlying business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and the excellent execution of our dedicated teams across all areas of our business, which will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide an overview of the significant pipeline progress across multiple therapeutic areas since the first quarter call. Today, I will start with oncology, followed by vaccines and infectious diseases and finally onto our broader pipeline. Starting with oncology. The development of meaningful treatment options for patients with earlier stage disease, where there is greater prospect to improve outcomes, continues to be an area of significant progress. Last week we announced, the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-756 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with high-risk, early-stage estrogen receptor-positive, HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, met one of its dual primary endpoints of pathological complete response following the neoadjuvant part of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant study. This is the first Phase 3 study to demonstrate a positive result for an immunotherapy-based regimen in early-stage breast cancer for this patient population. Further, in women\u2019s cancer and building on our progress in earlier-stages of disease, we announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial met one of its primary endpoints of progression-free survival for treatment of newly diagnosed patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. This is the first study of KEYTRUDA plus chemo-radiotherapy or radiotherapy to show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. At ASCO, as part of our investor event, we provided an overview of our clinical development pipeline and highlighted relevant data presentations. We have strong momentum as we evaluate the opportunity for KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of disease. Detailed results were presented from the ongoing KEYNOTE-671 study, evaluating [Technical Difficulty] with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with respectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy before surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA monotherapy after surgery, reduced the risk of disease recurrence, progression, or death by 42% versus preoperative chemotherapy alone. Subgroup analysis showed a consistent response regardless of PD-L1 expression, histology, and stage of disease. The PDUFA target action date is October 16. With the approval of KEYNOTE-091, as treatment after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, along with the potential approval for KEYNOTE-671 as treatment before and after surgery, KEYTRUDA will provide the optionality to benefit more patients with earlier-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Further data were also presented for KEYNOTE-942 from our Phase 2b study of KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna. The study showed a 65% reduction in risk of distant metastasis or death in patients with resected stage III / IV melanoma compared to KEYTRUDA alone. We are eager to build upon these findings and have started enrolling patients into the registrational Phase 3 trial for adjuvant treatment of high risk, stage IIB to IV melanoma, with plans to expand the program to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, data presented for MK-2870, our investigational anti-TROP-2 antibody drug conjugate, licensed from Kelun Biotech showed encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of TROP-2 expression level. We are advancing the broad clinical development program for this candidate with global Phase 3 trials scheduled in lung cancer and additional tumor types. On the regulatory front. Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, an important area of unmet need. In addition, our supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer, based on findings from KEYNOTE-966 was accepted by the FDA for review. The PDUFA target action date is February 7, 2024. We also announced new data from KEYNOTE-811, which demonstrated KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive. Merck has discussed these findings with the FDA and is working to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA. In addition, based on the data from the KEYNOTE-811 study, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Turning to vaccines and infectious diseases. We have taken a thoughtful and evidence-based approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidates to address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk subgroups, starting with VAXNEUVANCE and now continuing with V116, our investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults. V116 has potential to expand disease coverage to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease in more than 85% of individuals 65 and older, based on 2019 pre-pandemic CDC data. V116 includes eight serotypes not currently covered by approved pneumococcal vaccines, which are responsible for approximately 30% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older based on the same data. Last week, we announced positive topline results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating V116. The STRIDE-003 trial demonstrated statistically significant immune responses in vaccine-naive adults compared to PCV20 for serotypes common to both vaccines, and the STRIDE-006 trial demonstrated that V116 was immunogenic for all 21 pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine at least one year prior to the study. We are eager to share these findings and plan to present detailed data at an upcoming medical conference. As Rob noted, if approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes that represent adult pneumococcal disease. In Infectious Diseases, we received FDA approval for PREVYMIS for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease for adult recipients of kidney transplant who are at high-risk of CMV infection. Since 2017, PREVYMIS has been an important preventive option for CMV infection and disease in adult seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and we are pleased to build on the benefits it provides with this new approval. Progress continues in the cardiometabolic space. As Rob mentioned, following the remarkable results from the STELLAR trial, we have completed the submission to the FDA of the biologics license application for sotatercept, for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and we look forward to working with the Agency on its review. We are advancing our broad cardiovascular program. Enrollment in Phase 3 trials for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, is anticipated to start later this month. In June, at the European Association for the Study of the Liver meeting, positive results were presented from the Phase 2a randomized, active-comparator-controlled, open-label study of efinopegdutide, our investigational GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Based on the findings from this study, efinopegdutide was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA. We have now started a Phase 2b study to evaluate efficacy and safety in adult patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH. Lastly, the FDA has accepted our resubmission of the New Drug Application for gefapixant, our P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough in adults. The PDUFA target action date is December 27, 2023. This follows, the positive opinion from the CHMP in the European Union. And finally, as Rob mentioned, this past quarter we are were delighted to welcome our new colleagues from Prometheus to Merck. The team is focused on advancing the clinical development program for MK-7240, formerly PRA-023, and leveraging our combined strengths and expertise to better serve patients with immune-mediated diseases. In closing, we have established a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline progress and are proceeding with speed and rigor to advance a promising portfolio of diverse candidates, guided by science and focused on patient needs. Moving forward, we are well positioned to build on this momentum with further regulatory milestones, data readouts and clinical catalysts across therapeutic areas. And now I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Cedric, we're ready to take questions. We would appreciate analysts limit \u2013 limiting themselves to one question, so we can get to as many as possible today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Rob, you opened up the call with some comments on the IRA suit, so I wanted to ask you a little bit on that. I know it's hard to talk specifics on your strategy. But at a higher level, how important is it to get more companies to join the fray with Merck? And are there any milestones to watch for this fall on the suit beyond the initial 10 drugs being named next month? Thank you.\nRobert Davis: Yeah, Geoff. I appreciate the question. And with regards to the IRA, obviously our concern, and I think it's just worth reinforcing is about what we see as an untenable challenge to innovation in the industry. And that's really the principal reason that drove us to bring the suit. But to your question, as you know now, there are four drug companies actually in total, including Merck have raised suits, all largely following the same types of arguments in addition to -- we have the chamber filed a suit as well as the trade group pharma. So we're all moving forward and our belief is that the provisions, particularly the negotiation provision of the IRA is in violation of both the fifth and the first amendment of the constitution and is not a good policy. That's what brought us to bring to suit. As we look forward, we're going to take this to the fullest, which means we'll take it through district court, and if need be, in the circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court. So really, that's the strategy. I don't want to comment on other companies and whether you're going to see additional companies come in beyond the four that are in now. As far as any kind of triggers to watch for, not really. Because while obviously we have set dates for the initial discovery and some of the initial hearings, this is going to take a while to play out. What I do think is highly likely is that we will be able to see this resolved by the time we get into the 2026 time frame. That's really what we're thinking about and moving through the various courts as needed. But I don't really think you're going to see any large indicator in the near term. This is a longer-term play.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Geoff. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question. My question is regarding the onetime items. So Caroline, you mentioned regarding China for GARDASIL, as well as KEYTRUDA in the U.S. Would you be able to quantify this a little bit? Just trying to understand the magnitude of how much is impacted by those onetime items. Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: Yes, of course, Mohit. Thank you for the question. So first, talking about GARDASIL, there were no onetime items in the quarter for GARDASIL. We had exceptional growth, that growth was driven by every geography around the world. As we think about the second half of the year though, we do expect shipments to China to be less than they were in the first half of the year and therefore expect the second half of the year growth to be slower than what we've achieved in the first half. For KEYTRUDA, we had a very strong quarter, and that strength was across all indications, including the earlier-stage cancer indications that we\u2019re launching. In the United States, we had sales of $3.9 billion, a growth of 21%. Now that growth included approximately $50 million of benefit because wholesaler buy-in in the second quarter of 2023 was slightly higher than the buy-in we saw in the second quarter of 2022. One of the distributors who has brought in has indicated that they expect to buy out in the third quarter. And the quantum of that buyout has been indicated to be $150 million. That said, we continue to expect strong growth from KEYTRUDA given the current indications we have as well as new launches to come.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Mohit. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask you on your Prometheus Phase III clinical trial, if you could give more color on the trial designs and then when you'll start those. And then if you'll pursue any other indications outside of IBD. Thank you.\nDean Li: Yeah, so I'll take that. Thank you very much for the question in relationship to the Prometheus. Again, I just want to level set, for inflammatory bowel disease, there's a lot of cycling of anti-cytokines and then other mechanisms. Some of them actually have a black box. So we're very enthusiastic of moving forward with MK7240 or the TL1A. In relationship to the start of Phase III, the integration is going extremely well. We anticipate to be starting that Phase III this year for ulcerative colitis. And as other data comes in terms of Crohn's disease and other diseases, we'll adjust appropriately. So the start of the Phase III, we are targeting this year and the integration with our colleagues at Prometheus has gone extremely well.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Louise. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim Investments. Your line is open.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks. My question actually is on the pneumococcal vaccine, V116. Dean, just hoping that you could clarify for us what statistically significant means and if that actually implies superiority on individual serotypes, superiority on a new metric that perhaps could be an overall superiority to prevent our 20 (ph) in the STRIDE-3 results or if this is simply implying that it was statistically significant because it met the non-inferiority margin. Just trying to get a little bit more clarification there. And as a follow-up to that, just wanted to get a better sense of, if you believe the data, as it sits today, opens up a meaningful opportunity in international markets where national immunization programs have been reluctant to use pneumococcal vaccine in the adult setting largely because of herd immunity. Thanks.\nDean Li: Yeah. Thank you so much. So I'll just add a top line, just say I am pleased with the data and it gives me confidence in the path forward for V116. It's not just the data that's going to be presented, but this is going to be presented relatively soon at an international conference, but it's also the path to regulatory approval and eventually in the U.S. to ACIP. So this data is strong. And I just would recount that if approved, as you point out, it would be the first, the first adult-specific pneumococcal vaccine and it covers 85% of all pneumococcal disease in adults greater than -- or older than 65. The way that I think about the vaccine is a 21 valent, is that there's 10 shared with PCV20 and there's 11 uniques with PCV20. And as one looks at the data that will be coming out, one would see that in the shared one there, right, the question always in the shared one is, is there -- how does it compare with the shared ones with PCV20? And in that situation, it has met the non-inferior boundaries. And so I want to be clear about that. Clearly, the 11 unique serotypes are unique to V116. And so the issue for that is whether they're statistically significant, whether are clinically meaningful. And I'm confident as we move forward that, that will become clear. It's really hard to talk about superiority or anything like this when you're talking about the 11 unique serotypes. But I just want to step back because you've sort of touched on it a little bit. It validates the strategy of having an age appropriate serotype coverage. Just to remind everyone, V114 is 15 valent. It has 22F, 33F and has improved immunogenicity for serotype 3. And most importantly, it provides impotence protection within the first year of life. So that's how we thought about that age appropriate serotype coverage. And then V116 clearly is 21 valent invasive [indiscernible] pneumococcal disease and then is driving towards the adult market. But I'll turn it over to Rob to give some view of the prospects commercially, how we see it.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. No, thank you. Thanks, Dean, and thanks, Seamus, for the question. As Dean just summarized, the data is pretty much about as good as you could expect. So as we sit here today, we're very confident in what this vaccine can offer both in the United States, and we do believe there is a meaningful opportunity for us to take this internationally. So we're going to have to see how it plays out. But as we sit here today, we are excited about this product and ready to launch as soon as we get approval to do so because we do think, as Dean pointed out, we give 85% coverage. That's 30% better than Prevnar 20. It's also better than any other vaccine currently in development. So we think this is an important drug. And when you combine it with what we have with VAXNEUVANCE, our pneumococcal franchise is a significant opportunity that we think could be multibillion as we go out into the future. So this is something we're invested in and we're going to continue to drive aggressively.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Seamus. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Akash Tewari with Jefferies Group. Your line is open. Sorry, Jefferies, you line is open.\nAkash Tewari: Can you hear me?\nPeter Dannenbaum: Yes.\nAkash Tewari: Okay. Good. So prior to Prometheus, you guys had a pretty limited presence in immunology. Is there any urgency to build out that part of the business externally via BD? And does your team have any view on the FcRn (ph) inhibitor class, how large it may end up being over time and how maybe one of those assets could fit strategically with your plans in this category? Thank you.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. Akash, thanks for the question. I'll let Dean speak to the science side of this. But from a business perspective, we actually have had a presence in immunology. You might recall that across Europe and outside the United States, we sold Remicade. So we've been involved -- and Symphony. So we've been involved in this space. As we sit here today, we don't see a significant commercial build. We think actually we can leverage a lot of the capabilities we have. We will invest in this area for success. And then Dean can comment that we have been building on the science side. Obviously, we did the Pandion acquisition, building off the learning from immuno-oncology into the immunology space and now with Prometheus as well as we brought in some really top talent in both the discovery and development area in this area. So I think we're well positioned to drive this business. And obviously, we're always open to continuing to look for additional business development. But it's not something I think we have to do to fill a gap. It's more of how do we continue to augment for further growth.\nDean Li: Yeah. I will just answer scientifically. I mean, what we've done with external partnerships or, I should say, acquisitions with Pandion and Prometheus, it should be very clear how interested we are in those fields. I would also note that each one of them has a lead compound that the focus is but there are also follow-on compounds that come through that will be important. And especially in relationship to both of them, Prometheus and Pandion, we've been blessed by the fact that many of those top talent have chosen to continue with us. So we're very confident in this build. The other [Technical Difficulty] is that separate to those external, there is an internal pipeline that is moving reasonably fast and will become more clear in the clinical space in the next few years as well.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Akash. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChristopher Schott: Hi. Great. Thanks so much. Just a clarification to an earlier question and a follow-up. Just on KEYTRUDA and growth moderating in the second half. I guess, in addition to the U.S. wholesaler dynamic, I think you mentioned some EU price pressures. I just wanted to clarify, is that something incremental that you're expecting in the second half or more just a continuation of pressures you're already seeing in the first half of the year? And then my other question was just on business development. Just more broadly, the company has been pretty active over the past 12 to -- I guess. 12 months to 24 months. I guess what are just the priorities at this point? And should we think about a pause in activity post-Prometheus or is it really still full speed ahead in terms of looking at further transactions? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question, Chris. This is Caroline. In terms of the KEYTRUDA expectations for the remainder of the year, as we noted, we do expect continued price pressure in Europe. Two elements to that. The first is as we continue to launch new indications, we will see likely price reductions as we launch those new indications, but we'll see volume growth as we impact more patients and therefore drive revenue. We also do have the impact of some austerity measures or changes in reimbursement measures in some of our European countries, specifically in Germany with the shortening of the AMNOG review time line as well as in the U.K. with the [indiscernible]. So as we look forward, we do see that those pricing headwinds sustain, but we are confident in the continued growth that we will drive for KEYTRUDA.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. And Chris, on the business development question. As Caroline noted in the prepared remarks, we continue to have ample firepower to do deals. And while I can tell you, I feel very confident and I know the team feels very confident about the progress we're making with our internal pipeline and with the BD we've already done. If you look forward, we're going to be -- we've either recently announced or will be announcing a number of important Phase III assets across oncology with basically every area of the business, cardiometabolic, what we see in vaccines as well as important upcoming launches. We've talked about V116 data, sotatercept. We can go down the line. So I feel very good about the progress. That being said, we continue to have a priority to do business development. So you should not necessarily expect a slowdown. If and when assets that bring important scientific opportunities present themselves, where we see an alignment with strategy and where we can see value creation, we have the capacity and we will be and are willing to act on those. So we\u2019re actively looking and we\u2019ll continue to drive deals because while I feel very good about where we are, we\u2019re talking about trying to build a sustainable engine well into the next decade. And we want to continue to add to the firepower we have coming out of our own discovery and development labs as well.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Chris. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Dana Graybosch with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: Hello. I have a question \u2013 thank you for the question -- on KEYTRUDA. I wonder if you could talk about how much remaining headroom you see for KEYTRUDA growth in some of the early-stage markets that you've been mentioning, including triple-negative breast cancer, RCC, I believe it's probably stage 2 melanoma and lung cancer, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. So I'll start and Caroline can add in if I miss something here. But the high-level answer is we see a lot of room for continued growth both in early-stage cancers, the ones where we have current indications, and importantly, ones that are still coming. So kind of running through the list, triple-negative breast cancer obviously, has driven important growth, both in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. It was a big driver of growth last year in the United States. It's a driver of growth in the U.S. this year. That will slow into next year in the U.S., but we're seeing it picking up outside the United States because we're at an earlier phase in the launch across the world. So that will continue to be an important area. And then you saw today, we announced important data in KEYNOTE-756. So that is promising for a future indication that we could potentially see coming down the path in early-stage breast cancer as well. If you look at lung cancer, we continue to expect growth. In fact, we're growing in lung cancer now, both internationally and in the U.S. But importantly, what's going to drive growth longer term is as we continue to penetrate into earlier lines of therapy, obviously we're early in the launch of KEYNOTE-091 in the United States and in certain markets outside the U.S. We're very excited about what KEYNOTE-761 could be and how that will help drive growth in non-small cell lung cancer. And then across RCC, continued good growth in the adjuvant setting, good growth in metastatic. We have what's coming with WELIREG, which is going to continue to broaden our opportunity there. Great growth coming in bladder cancer. I'll stop there, because I could go on but we want to get to other questions. The short answer is a lot of growth, a lot of opportunity with KEYTRUDA. We're going to make a big difference in a lot of patients' lives as we move forward with this drug.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Dana. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTimothy Anderson: Hi. Thank you. I have a question for Dean on the TROP-2 asset from Kelun. Kind of a key debate and a newer debate has been the role of the TROP-2 biomarker and whether higher expression predicts better response. And it's come into focus more recently, partly because of Aztra's top line on their lung trial as well as the Phase III trial they started earlier this year. So I'd like to get your views on the role of this biomarker. And specifically, do you plan to include that as a stratification factor in any of your upcoming Phase III trials?\nDean Li: Yeah. Thank you very much for that question about TROP-2 ADCs, especially in relation to the lung. So as a broader picture, I would just say that initially the focus will be in the metastatic, and then depending on how those play out, it may go into earlier stages of cancer as well more broadly. But as we talk about lung cancer, the critical question that the field has to answer us and others, is whether or not you can dethrone KEYNOTE-189. So we're all trying to dethrone Merck's standard of care, which is pembro plus chemo in first-line in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. I will just say, lots of people have tried to do it, including us and it's a high bar to try to overcome. And so the issue for us is how do you overcome that? Because I think if you can prove that an ADC can do that, that will be very important for the field. And so we have our data. It's -- we are very comfortable with the safety. But we think that it may be important to maximize the impact of the TROP-2 ADC so that you can give something meaningful benefit over KEYNOTE-189. So I think the biomarker could be important if what you're trying to do is displace KEYNOTE-189 because KEYNOTE-189 is a high bar to beat.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Tim. Next question please, Cedric.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. With sotatercept, you acknowledged the progress of the filing completed in the third quarter here. Could you just remind us in terms of what your expectations are for potential label? Any nuances here in particular with regard to secondary endpoints that you think would be meaningful from a commercial standpoint? And then recognizing that you have had some commercial footprint, what should we think about in terms of what's going to be required with the potential launch in 2024? And similarly, with reimbursement for a new product, what should we think in terms of the cadence? We do recognize that physicians have been quite aware and enthusiastic about the data. Thank you.\nDean Li: Yeah. So let me take the science part of that, Chris. In relationship to sotatercept in the STELLAR trial, I think the label in the U.S. will be reasonably clear and follow that of what the STELLAR trial is. I think one of the things that was really important is that when we declared it, we didn't just declare a 6-minute walk. We declared a time to clinical worsening and death, which was really important because I think that creates a different scenario for us than what we had predicted previously in our ability to go-to-market outside of the U.S. So I think that will be in the label within the FDA. But I think where it's important is it may change the speed with which the international markets adopt sotatercept. I hope that gives you that general sense. But as we move this forward, we are looking, and I think we've said previously that we would have the file complete. And I think given the general sense, we thought that we would be launching, at least within the U.S., in the earlier part of 2024.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. Chris, this is Rob. So on the question of our infrastructure support and launch, we're actually well positioned. I would remind you that we currently market Adempas outside the United States, that is NPAH. So outside the U.S., we're going to be able to leverage our relationships and our infrastructure there. We -- obviously, we'll add to it. And then in the United States, this is in its first indications. Anyway, more of a rare disease. You're looking at about 150 specialty centers in the United States have actually prescribed this. So this -- we're not talking a large commercial footprint. This is more of a rare disease type of launch. And we've been focused on building out capabilities, particularly as we think about medical affairs, science liaisons and how do we manage the relationships, kind of the complex journey of patients facing these diseases with their physicians. A lot of work is already underway. So I'm quite confident we'll be prepared for our launch, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Because as Dean mentioned, our belief, what this can be globally is much bigger than when we originally did the deal given what we expect to be the label we will see. As far as the reimbursement goes, to your point, this drug, especially in the United States is very well known. The specialists in the area already understand it. They're already waiting for it. We know there are patients waiting for it. So I think you could expect a pretty fast uptake of the drug, especially in the United States. Outside the U.S., we're going to have to drive for reimbursement. That will take longer. But I think in both cases, our expectations and confidence in both the speed of uptake and the potential total volume or total revenue potential of this drug is more significant today than when we did the deal, just given the strength of the stellar results and what we continue to expect. So we're quite bullish on this.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Chris. We have time for couple more questions please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yeah. So next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A clarification for Dean and then a question for Rob. So just in regards to the previous question about TROP-2, just so I'm clear, do you plan to stratify or select for TROP-2 expression in your first-line -- first and second-line outcome trials, particularly for those patients with actionable -- without actionable genomic mutation. So are you actually going to stratify a select within the trials aimed at that patient cohort? And then second for Rob, if your efforts to repeal or amend the IRA are unsuccessful, would you delay the launch of your oral PCSK9 until you have outcome data in hand? Many thanks.\nDean Li: Yeah. So let me just take care. I don't want to get too ahead of what's on clinical trials. But as I've emphasized, especially when we're thinking about first-line non-small cell lung cancer, given what we think is a standard of care, we think that it will be important to review that in the setting of a biomarker selection. And I just kind of want to leave it at that. The precise design will come out as the teams actually roll it out. But we think that, as I've said before, the biomarker strategy will be very important for our push of TROP-2 ADCs into lung cancer.\nRobert Davis: Yeah. And on the question of how we think about the oral PCSK9 and would we delay for an outcome study, I think it's too early to make that kind of decision because, frankly, how we think about the outcome study and whether or not, and what kind of label we get before we have an outcome study is still something we\u2019re working through. So we need to understand the label, we need to understand the timing of the outcome study. And until I know all those points, I wouldn\u2019t want to get ahead of where we would be. So more to come. We\u2019ve got some time on that one.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Andrew. So last questions please, Cedric.\nOperator: Yes. Our last question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nStephen Scala: Thank you so much. A question for Dean on the KEYTRUDA data in per-adjuvant ER-positive breast cancer. Should we expect the EFS to read out well before the KEYTRUDA LOE so the commercial opportunity can be realized? How do you think it stacks up to CDK4/6 inhibitors in the adjuvant setting? And is there potential to file for neoadjuvant approval in the meantime? Thank you.\nDean Li: So I'll just step back a little bit. So the KEYNOTE-756, as you've noted, is an ER-positive HER2-negative, it's earlier stage, it is neoadjuvant/adjuvant. We've given -- based on the data that we've given in the press release that it's [indiscernible] in relationship to an interim. As you know, EFS is already event-based. And so the question is how fast do you accrue events in relationship to that. And our hope is -- the answer to your question is yes. But we will just have to see because they are event-based. I would just highlight, in KEYNOTE-522, which is triple negative breast, which is also earlier stage, which is also neoadjuvant/adjuvant and also at a positive path CR, we've demonstrated that path CR is a predictive of the future followed up by EFS. And so we'll have to just watch that data as that data advances.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Steve. Rob?\nRobert Davis: Yeah. Well, I appreciate everyone investing time today with the call. And just really maybe to conclude, I just want to reinforce how confident I am about how well positioned we are to continue to drive value creation for patients, for shareholders and for all of our stakeholders well into the future. And again, I just really want to thank all of my great colleagues across the globe for their substantial efforts. We really do look forward to building on the progress we have in the second half of 2023 and beyond. And hopefully, what you took from our comments today, both prepared and in the Q&A, is our confidence in the progress we're making and really, the difference we can make for patients across an ever broadening area of therapeutic possibility. So it's exciting what we have in front of us right now. Thank you.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you all.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to provide an overview of the significant pipeline progress across multiple therapeutic areas since the first quarter call. Today, I will start with oncology, followed by vaccines and infectious diseases and finally onto our broader pipeline. Starting with oncology. The development of meaningful treatment options for patients with earlier stage disease, where there is greater prospect to improve outcomes, continues to be an area of significant progress. Last week we announced, the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-756 trial evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with high-risk, early-stage estrogen receptor-positive, HR positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, met one of its dual primary endpoints of pathological complete response following the neoadjuvant part of the neoadjuvant/adjuvant study. This is the first Phase 3 study to demonstrate a positive result for an immunotherapy-based regimen in early-stage breast cancer for this patient population. Further, in women's cancer and building on our progress in earlier-stages of disease, we announced that the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-A18 trial met one of its primary endpoints of progression-free survival for treatment of newly diagnosed patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. This is the first study of KEYTRUDA plus chemo-radiotherapy or radiotherapy to show statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival. At ASCO, as part of our investor event, we provided an overview of our clinical development pipeline and highlighted relevant data presentations. We have strong momentum as we evaluate the opportunity for KEYTRUDA in earlier stages of disease. Detailed results were presented from the ongoing KEYNOTE-671 study, evaluating [Technical Difficulty] with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy, followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in patients with respectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment with KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy before surgery, followed by KEYTRUDA monotherapy after surgery, reduced the risk of disease recurrence, progression, or death by 42% versus preoperative chemotherapy alone. Subgroup analysis showed a consistent response regardless of PD-L1 expression, histology, and stage of disease. The PDUFA target action date is October 16. With the approval of KEYNOTE-091, as treatment after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, along with the potential approval for KEYNOTE-671 as treatment before and after surgery, KEYTRUDA will provide the optionality to benefit more patients with earlier-stage non-small cell lung cancer. Further data were also presented for KEYNOTE-942 from our Phase 2b study of KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna. The study showed a 65% reduction in risk of distant metastasis or death in patients with resected stage III / IV melanoma compared to KEYTRUDA alone. We are eager to build upon these findings and have started enrolling patients into the registrational Phase 3 trial for adjuvant treatment of high risk, stage IIB to IV melanoma, with plans to expand the program to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Finally, data presented for MK-2870, our investigational anti-TROP-2 antibody drug conjugate, licensed from Kelun Biotech showed encouraging anti-tumor activity in patients with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, regardless of TROP-2 expression level. We are advancing the broad clinical development program for this candidate with global Phase 3 trials scheduled in lung cancer and additional tumor types. On the regulatory front. Lynparza in combination with abiraterone and prednisone, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, an important area of unmet need. In addition, our supplemental Biologics License Application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer, based on findings from KEYNOTE-966 was accepted by the FDA for review. The PDUFA target action date is February 7, 2024. We also announced new data from KEYNOTE-811, which demonstrated KEYTRUDA in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival for the first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in patients whose tumors were PD-L1 positive. Merck has discussed these findings with the FDA and is working to update the current indication for KEYTRUDA. In addition, based on the data from the KEYNOTE-811 study, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. Turning to vaccines and infectious diseases. We have taken a thoughtful and evidence-based approach to establishing a pipeline of pneumococcal vaccine candidates to address the specific needs of different populations, including infants and children, healthy adults and at-risk subgroups, starting with VAXNEUVANCE and now continuing with V116, our investigational 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults. V116 has potential to expand disease coverage to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease in more than 85% of individuals 65 and older, based on 2019 pre-pandemic CDC data. V116 includes eight serotypes not currently covered by approved pneumococcal vaccines, which are responsible for approximately 30% of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 and older based on the same data. Last week, we announced positive topline results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating V116. The STRIDE-003 trial demonstrated statistically significant immune responses in vaccine-naive adults compared to PCV20 for serotypes common to both vaccines, and the STRIDE-006 trial demonstrated that V116 was immunogenic for all 21 pneumococcal serotypes in the vaccine among adults who previously received a pneumococcal vaccine at least one year prior to the study. We are eager to share these findings and plan to present detailed data at an upcoming medical conference. As Rob noted, if approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed to address the serotypes that represent adult pneumococcal disease. In Infectious Diseases, we received FDA approval for PREVYMIS for prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus disease for adult recipients of kidney transplant who are at high-risk of CMV infection. Since 2017, PREVYMIS has been an important preventive option for CMV infection and disease in adult seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and we are pleased to build on the benefits it provides with this new approval. Progress continues in the cardiometabolic space. As Rob mentioned, following the remarkable results from the STELLAR trial, we have completed the submission to the FDA of the biologics license application for sotatercept, for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Sotatercept has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, and we look forward to working with the Agency on its review. We are advancing our broad cardiovascular program. Enrollment in Phase 3 trials for MK-0616, our oral PCSK9 inhibitor, is anticipated to start later this month. In June, at the European Association for the Study of the Liver meeting, positive results were presented from the Phase 2a randomized, active-comparator-controlled, open-label study of efinopegdutide, our investigational GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist, in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Based on the findings from this study, efinopegdutide was granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA. We have now started a Phase 2b study to evaluate efficacy and safety in adult patients with pre-cirrhotic NASH. Lastly, the FDA has accepted our resubmission of the New Drug Application for gefapixant, our P2X3 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough in adults. The PDUFA target action date is December 27, 2023. This follows, the positive opinion from the CHMP in the European Union. And finally, as Rob mentioned, this past quarter we are were delighted to welcome our new colleagues from Prometheus to Merck. The team is focused on advancing the clinical development program for MK-7240, formerly PRA-023, and leveraging our combined strengths and expertise to better serve patients with immune-mediated diseases. In closing, we have established a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline progress and are proceeding with speed and rigor to advance a promising portfolio of diverse candidates, guided by science and focused on patient needs. Moving forward, we are well positioned to build on this momentum with further regulatory milestones, data readouts and clinical catalysts across therapeutic areas. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Yeah, so I'll take that. Thank you very much for the question in relationship to the Prometheus. Again, I just want to level set, for inflammatory bowel disease, there's a lot of cycling of anti-cytokines and then other mechanisms. Some of them actually have a black box. So we're very enthusiastic of moving forward with MK7240 or the TL1A. In relationship to the start of Phase III, the integration is going extremely well. We anticipate to be starting that Phase III this year for ulcerative colitis. And as other data comes in terms of Crohn's disease and other diseases, we'll adjust appropriately. So the start of the Phase III, we are targeting this year and the integration with our colleagues at Prometheus has gone extremely well. Yeah. Thank you so much. So I'll just add a top line, just say I am pleased with the data and it gives me confidence in the path forward for V116. It's not just the data that's going to be presented, but this is going to be presented relatively soon at an international conference, but it's also the path to regulatory approval and eventually in the U.S. to ACIP. So this data is strong. And I just would recount that if approved, as you point out, it would be the first, the first adult-specific pneumococcal vaccine and it covers 85% of all pneumococcal disease in adults greater than -- or older than 65. The way that I think about the vaccine is a 21 valent, is that there's 10 shared with PCV20 and there's 11 uniques with PCV20. And as one looks at the data that will be coming out, one would see that in the shared one there, right, the question always in the shared one is, is there -- how does it compare with the shared ones with PCV20? And in that situation, it has met the non-inferior boundaries. And so I want to be clear about that. Clearly, the 11 unique serotypes are unique to V116. And so the issue for that is whether they're statistically significant, whether are clinically meaningful. And I'm confident as we move forward that, that will become clear. It's really hard to talk about superiority or anything like this when you're talking about the 11 unique serotypes. But I just want to step back because you've sort of touched on it a little bit. It validates the strategy of having an age appropriate serotype coverage. Just to remind everyone, V114 is 15 valent. It has 22F, 33F and has improved immunogenicity for serotype 3. And most importantly, it provides impotence protection within the first year of life. So that's how we thought about that age appropriate serotype coverage. And then V116 clearly is 21 valent invasive [indiscernible] pneumococcal disease and then is driving towards the adult market. But I'll turn it over to Rob to give some view of the prospects commercially, how we see it. Yeah. I will just answer scientifically. I mean, what we've done with external partnerships or, I should say, acquisitions with Pandion and Prometheus, it should be very clear how interested we are in those fields. I would also note that each one of them has a lead compound that the focus is but there are also follow-on compounds that come through that will be important. And especially in relationship to both of them, Prometheus and Pandion, we've been blessed by the fact that many of those top talent have chosen to continue with us. So we're very confident in this build. The other [Technical Difficulty] is that separate to those external, there is an internal pipeline that is moving reasonably fast and will become more clear in the clinical space in the next few years as well. Yeah. Thank you very much for that question about TROP-2 ADCs, especially in relation to the lung. So as a broader picture, I would just say that initially the focus will be in the metastatic, and then depending on how those play out, it may go into earlier stages of cancer as well more broadly. But as we talk about lung cancer, the critical question that the field has to answer us and others, is whether or not you can dethrone KEYNOTE-189. So we're all trying to dethrone Merck's standard of care, which is pembro plus chemo in first-line in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. I will just say, lots of people have tried to do it, including us and it's a high bar to try to overcome. And so the issue for us is how do you overcome that? Because I think if you can prove that an ADC can do that, that will be very important for the field. And so we have our data. It's -- we are very comfortable with the safety. But we think that it may be important to maximize the impact of the TROP-2 ADC so that you can give something meaningful benefit over KEYNOTE-189. So I think the biomarker could be important if what you're trying to do is displace KEYNOTE-189 because KEYNOTE-189 is a high bar to beat. Yeah. So let me take the science part of that, Chris. In relationship to sotatercept in the STELLAR trial, I think the label in the U.S. will be reasonably clear and follow that of what the STELLAR trial is. I think one of the things that was really important is that when we declared it, we didn't just declare a 6-minute walk. We declared a time to clinical worsening and death, which was really important because I think that creates a different scenario for us than what we had predicted previously in our ability to go-to-market outside of the U.S. So I think that will be in the label within the FDA. But I think where it's important is it may change the speed with which the international markets adopt sotatercept. I hope that gives you that general sense. But as we move this forward, we are looking, and I think we've said previously that we would have the file complete. And I think given the general sense, we thought that we would be launching, at least within the U.S., in the earlier part of 2024. Yeah. So let me just take care. I don't want to get too ahead of what's on clinical trials. But as I've emphasized, especially when we're thinking about first-line non-small cell lung cancer, given what we think is a standard of care, we think that it will be important to review that in the setting of a biomarker selection. And I just kind of want to leave it at that. The precise design will come out as the teams actually roll it out. But we think that, as I've said before, the biomarker strategy will be very important for our push of TROP-2 ADCs into lung cancer. So I'll just step back a little bit. So the KEYNOTE-756, as you've noted, is an ER-positive HER2-negative, it's earlier stage, it is neoadjuvant/adjuvant. We've given -- based on the data that we've given in the press release that it's [indiscernible] in relationship to an interim. As you know, EFS is already event-based. And so the question is how fast do you accrue events in relationship to that. And our hope is -- the answer to your question is yes. But we will just have to see because they are event-based. I would just highlight, in KEYNOTE-522, which is triple negative breast, which is also earlier stage, which is also neoadjuvant/adjuvant and also at a positive path CR, we've demonstrated that path CR is a predictive of the future followed up by EFS. And so we'll have to just watch that data as that data advances."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another very strong quarter, with underlying growth driven by demand across our innovative portfolio. These results reflect the profound impact of our medicines and vaccines globally and reinforce the confidence we have in the health of our business, and in the outlook for continued strong underlying growth. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $15 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong growth of 14%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its strong momentum. Excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 17%, driven by Oncology and Vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 2% across both companion animal and livestock products. Now, turning to the second quarter performance of our key brands. In Oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $6.3 billion driven by increased utilization from approvals in earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from usage in earlier-stage cancers including triple negative breast cancer, as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We are encouraged by the positive feedback from healthcare providers and initial uptake of KEYNOTE-091, reflecting the significant impact KEYTRUDA is having on patients with earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA is maintaining its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by demand in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer, as well as in earlier-stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma, which saw continued uptake in recently launched markets. Lynparza remains the market leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 15% driven by increased demand in certain international markets. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 6% due to increased demand for the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and endometrial cancer in the U.S., partially offset by lower sales in China. Our vaccines portfolio delivered exceptional growth, led by GARDASIL, which grew 53% to $2.5 billion. Performance was driven by strong global demand, especially in China, where we are benefitting from the expanded indication of GARDASIL 9 for girls and women 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from increased uptake of VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our Hospital Acute Care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 19%, driven by increased market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents in the U.S. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 2%. Livestock sales growth reflects price actions as well as higher demand for swine and poultry products, partially offset by lower demand for ruminant products, due in part to reduced herd sizes. Companion animal growth reflects price actions, including for the BRAVECTO line of products partially offset by supply challenges for certain vaccines. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.6%, an increase of 1.9 percentage points due to favorable product mix, including a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $15.9 billion, including a $10.2 billion one-time charge related to the acquisition of Prometheus. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 10%. This growth reflects increased investments in support of near-term opportunities for our in-line portfolio and disciplined investments for the future as we advance our exciting early and late-phase pipeline. Other income was $19 million. Our tax provision was approximately $800 million. As a result of the Prometheus one-time charge, we had a pre-tax loss this quarter. This one-time charge is not tax deductible. Our tax rate is therefore a negative 18.4%. Taken together, we reported a loss of $2.06 per share, which includes a negative impact of $4.02 per share from the one-time charge related to the Prometheus transaction. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The underlying strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $58.6 and $59.6 billion, an increase of $800 million at the midpoint. This range reflects strong underlying year-over-year revenue growth of 10% to 11%, offset by the expected lower sales of LAGEVRIO, which we continue to estimate to be approximately $1 billion this year, and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption is unchanged at approximately 77%. We now estimate operating expenses to be between $34 billion and $34.6 billion. This range includes $11.6 billion of acquisition and upfront collaboration research and development expenses associated with Prometheus, Imago and Kelun. Our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. We now assume other expense of approximately $100 million, which includes incremental financing costs related to Prometheus. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 30.5% and 31.5%, reflecting an increase due to the Prometheus transaction of approximately 15 percentage points. We continue to assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $2.95 to $3.05, which includes the one-time charge for Prometheus and a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 5 percentage points versus 2022, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $6.88 to $7, which we noted at the time excluded Prometheus. Had we included the $4.02 one-time charge and an estimated $0.14 to advance the assets and financing costs, our prior guidance range would have been $2.72 to $2.84 with a midpoint of $2.78. Our current guidance midpoint of $3 represents an increase resulting from the strength in our business of approximately $0.24, partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.02. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the strength of our business driven by our key pillars, enabling us to deliver robust underlying growth while investing in our promising pipeline. As you consider your models, there are a couple of items to keep in mind. KEYTRUDA growth has been exceptional in recent quarters, outperforming our expectations, driven in part by robust uptake of recently launched earlier stage indications. We continue to expect strong year-over-year growth of KEYTRUDA, but not quite at the levels experienced in recent quarters, as a result of lapping launches and the impact of continued pricing headwinds, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets. In addition, there was a small benefit from wholesaler purchase timing in the U.S. in the second quarter, which we expect to reverse in the third quarter. As we look out to 2024 and beyond, we continue to expect strong growth including the impact of additional approvals. And as a reminder, while we expect the pace of growth of GARDASIL to be higher in 2023 than 2022, the rate of second half growth is anticipated to be below the first half, due in part to the timing of shipments to China. Now turning to capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to drive near and long-term growth across our portfolio. We remain committed to our dividend, with the goal of increasing it over time. Business development remains a priority. We remain well positioned to pursue the most compelling external science through value enhancing business development to augment our pipeline. We continue to expect to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, we remain very confident in both, the strength of our underlying business, driven by global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines, and the excellent execution of our dedicated teams across all areas of our business, which will enable us to continue to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Yes, of course, Mohit. Thank you for the question. So first, talking about GARDASIL, there were no onetime items in the quarter for GARDASIL. We had exceptional growth, that growth was driven by every geography around the world. As we think about the second half of the year though, we do expect shipments to China to be less than they were in the first half of the year and therefore expect the second half of the year growth to be slower than what we've achieved in the first half. For KEYTRUDA, we had a very strong quarter, and that strength was across all indications, including the earlier-stage cancer indications that we're launching. In the United States, we had sales of $3.9 billion, a growth of 21%. Now that growth included approximately $50 million of benefit because wholesaler buy-in in the second quarter of 2023 was slightly higher than the buy-in we saw in the second quarter of 2022. One of the distributors who has brought in has indicated that they expect to buy out in the third quarter. And the quantum of that buyout has been indicated to be $150 million. That said, we continue to expect strong growth from KEYTRUDA given the current indications we have as well as new launches to come. Thank you for the question, Chris. This is Caroline. In terms of the KEYTRUDA expectations for the remainder of the year, as we noted, we do expect continued price pressure in Europe. Two elements to that. The first is as we continue to launch new indications, we will see likely price reductions as we launch those new indications, but we'll see volume growth as we impact more patients and therefore drive revenue. We also do have the impact of some austerity measures or changes in reimbursement measures in some of our European countries, specifically in Germany with the shortening of the AMNOG review time line as well as in the U.K. with the [indiscernible]. So as we look forward, we do see that those pricing headwinds sustain, but we are confident in the continued growth that we will drive for KEYTRUDA."

            "name": "Robert Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We continue to make great progress in bringing forward compelling science to help address the world's most urgent unmet medical needs. Thanks to the unwavering commitment and discipline of our global teams, we're advancing our innovative pipeline and executing operationally in support of our key growth drivers. Our science-led strategy is generating innovations that save and improve the lives of patients and animals around the world and is delivering strong underlying growth for our business. We're building on our strong track record and advancing our strategic priorities. We're progressing our deep pipeline, including sotatercept for which we have completed our FDA submission, and augmenting it with further strategic business development where we can add value by applying our clinical expertise and leveraging our global scale to accelerate broad access to patients. An excellent example of this is our acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences, which we completed in June. We're now actively integrating the talented team and are moving with speed toward initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial. The addition of Prometheus significantly strengthens our presence in immunology, an area with substantial unmet medical need and builds on the significant scientific insight we have gained in immuno-oncology. It also brings us a potential first-in-class, best-in-class novel TL1A inhibitor, which provides us the opportunity to transform the standard of care in a patient population suffering from debilitating immune-mediated diseases with a foundation of great science and a legacy of commercial excellence, we're well-positioned to deliver sustainable value over the long-term. Focusing now on the short-term. We delivered strong underlying growth, excluding the year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales, led by robust demand across key growth drivers in Oncology and Vaccines. We remain confident in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will address in a moment. Moving to our research organization, our promising late-stage pipeline continues to demonstrate tangible and impactful benefits for patients across a broad range of diseases. In oncology, we highlighted data from our expansive pipeline at ASCO, including for KEYTRUDA in earlier stage lung cancer. The strong results of KEYNOTE-671 for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer support our aspiration to fundamentally shift the way cancer is managed by developing treatment regimens in the earlier stage setting, where the potential for better outcomes is higher. Additionally, we're leveraging KEYTRUDA's wide-reaching benefit across a range of cancer types to identify and bring forward promising new candidates. At ASCO, we shared positive data for KEYTRUDA in combination with V940, our investigational individualized neoantigen therapy in collaboration with Moderna, in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma. And promising data was also presented by our partner Kelun Biotech for MK-2870, our TROP-2 ADC in non-small cell lung cancer. Each of these novel candidates offer a glimpse into the future of cancer care and the potential to meaningfully improve outcomes for patients. We have also made progress outside of oncology. We're advancing our population specific approach to pneumococcal vaccination and are very pleased to have announced positive topline results for our adult vaccine candidate V116. If approved, V116 would be the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults. And Dean will speak to our progress in cardiometabolic disease including positive data we recently presented for our GLP-1/glucagon receptor dual agonist. I commend Dean and his team on the significant work being done to advance our broad pipeline and their commitment to Merck's purpose. Innovation is the core of who Merck is and it's what our company strives to achieve every day. We're grounded in the relentless pursuit of advancing science and raising the bar of innovation to deliver value for patients. With that in mind, I\u2018d like to speak for a moment about the Inflation Reduction Act. We've consistently communicated our support for elements of the law that improve patient affordability and access, such as the Medicare Part D reform, but which do so without damaging the very promising long-term innovation potential of the biopharmaceutical industry. Through the complaint we recently filed in U.S. District Court, Merck is taking a principled stand against the negative long-term impacts of the price negotiation provision of the IRA which we believe amounts to unconstitutional price setting that violates several provisions of the U.S. Constitution. This misguided policy does not strike the right balance between incenting investment in innovation and improving affordability and access. That said, we remain committed to working with the U.S. government to find a better approach to improve affordability and access while protecting further drug breakthroughs that benefit patients facing unmet medical needs. We know it is critical that we provide broad access both to our current portfolio of medicines and vaccines, and to our future innovations, in order to serve the greatest number of patients possible, now and for years to come. Our upcoming annual Impact Report will highlight accomplishments across our four priority areas, including access to health, where a portion of employee compensation will now be driven by metrics linked to our progress. In summary, our science-led strategy is working. We're driving significant scientific, commercial and operational momentum which we expect will enable strong full-year growth. I want to thank our talented, dedicated and diverse global team for their hard work and commitment to delivering value for patients, shareholders and all of our stakeholders. With these efforts, I'm confident we will continue to drive sustainable success well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Yeah, Geoff. I appreciate the question. And with regards to the IRA, obviously our concern, and I think it's just worth reinforcing is about what we see as an untenable challenge to innovation in the industry. And that's really the principal reason that drove us to bring the suit. But to your question, as you know now, there are four drug companies actually in total, including Merck have raised suits, all largely following the same types of arguments in addition to -- we have the chamber filed a suit as well as the trade group pharma. So we're all moving forward and our belief is that the provisions, particularly the negotiation provision of the IRA is in violation of both the fifth and the first amendment of the constitution and is not a good policy. That's what brought us to bring to suit. As we look forward, we're going to take this to the fullest, which means we'll take it through district court, and if need be, in the circuit court and ultimately to the Supreme Court. So really, that's the strategy. I don't want to comment on other companies and whether you're going to see additional companies come in beyond the four that are in now. As far as any kind of triggers to watch for, not really. Because while obviously we have set dates for the initial discovery and some of the initial hearings, this is going to take a while to play out. What I do think is highly likely is that we will be able to see this resolved by the time we get into the 2026 time frame. That's really what we're thinking about and moving through the various courts as needed. But I don't really think you're going to see any large indicator in the near term. This is a longer-term play. Yeah. No, thank you. Thanks, Dean, and thanks, Seamus, for the question. As Dean just summarized, the data is pretty much about as good as you could expect. So as we sit here today, we're very confident in what this vaccine can offer both in the United States, and we do believe there is a meaningful opportunity for us to take this internationally. So we're going to have to see how it plays out. But as we sit here today, we are excited about this product and ready to launch as soon as we get approval to do so because we do think, as Dean pointed out, we give 85% coverage. That's 30% better than Prevnar 20. It's also better than any other vaccine currently in development. So we think this is an important drug. And when you combine it with what we have with VAXNEUVANCE, our pneumococcal franchise is a significant opportunity that we think could be multibillion as we go out into the future. So this is something we're invested in and we're going to continue to drive aggressively. Yeah. Akash, thanks for the question. I'll let Dean speak to the science side of this. But from a business perspective, we actually have had a presence in immunology. You might recall that across Europe and outside the United States, we sold Remicade. So we've been involved -- and Symphony. So we've been involved in this space. As we sit here today, we don't see a significant commercial build. We think actually we can leverage a lot of the capabilities we have. We will invest in this area for success. And then Dean can comment that we have been building on the science side. Obviously, we did the Pandion acquisition, building off the learning from immuno-oncology into the immunology space and now with Prometheus as well as we brought in some really top talent in both the discovery and development area in this area. So I think we're well positioned to drive this business. And obviously, we're always open to continuing to look for additional business development. But it's not something I think we have to do to fill a gap. It's more of how do we continue to augment for further growth. Yeah. And Chris, on the business development question. As Caroline noted in the prepared remarks, we continue to have ample firepower to do deals. And while I can tell you, I feel very confident and I know the team feels very confident about the progress we're making with our internal pipeline and with the BD we've already done. If you look forward, we're going to be -- we've either recently announced or will be announcing a number of important Phase III assets across oncology with basically every area of the business, cardiometabolic, what we see in vaccines as well as important upcoming launches. We've talked about V116 data, sotatercept. We can go down the line. So I feel very good about the progress. That being said, we continue to have a priority to do business development. So you should not necessarily expect a slowdown. If and when assets that bring important scientific opportunities present themselves, where we see an alignment with strategy and where we can see value creation, we have the capacity and we will be and are willing to act on those. So we're actively looking and we'll continue to drive deals because while I feel very good about where we are, we're talking about trying to build a sustainable engine well into the next decade. And we want to continue to add to the firepower we have coming out of our own discovery and development labs as well. Yeah. So I'll start and Caroline can add in if I miss something here. But the high-level answer is we see a lot of room for continued growth both in early-stage cancers, the ones where we have current indications, and importantly, ones that are still coming. So kind of running through the list, triple-negative breast cancer obviously, has driven important growth, both in the adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic setting. It was a big driver of growth last year in the United States. It's a driver of growth in the U.S. this year. That will slow into next year in the U.S., but we're seeing it picking up outside the United States because we're at an earlier phase in the launch across the world. So that will continue to be an important area. And then you saw today, we announced important data in KEYNOTE-756. So that is promising for a future indication that we could potentially see coming down the path in early-stage breast cancer as well. If you look at lung cancer, we continue to expect growth. In fact, we're growing in lung cancer now, both internationally and in the U.S. But importantly, what's going to drive growth longer term is as we continue to penetrate into earlier lines of therapy, obviously we're early in the launch of KEYNOTE-091 in the United States and in certain markets outside the U.S. We're very excited about what KEYNOTE-761 could be and how that will help drive growth in non-small cell lung cancer. And then across RCC, continued good growth in the adjuvant setting, good growth in metastatic. We have what's coming with WELIREG, which is going to continue to broaden our opportunity there. Great growth coming in bladder cancer. I'll stop there, because I could go on but we want to get to other questions. The short answer is a lot of growth, a lot of opportunity with KEYTRUDA. We're going to make a big difference in a lot of patients' lives as we move forward with this drug. Yeah. Chris, this is Rob. So on the question of our infrastructure support and launch, we're actually well positioned. I would remind you that we currently market Adempas outside the United States, that is NPAH. So outside the U.S., we're going to be able to leverage our relationships and our infrastructure there. We -- obviously, we'll add to it. And then in the United States, this is in its first indications. Anyway, more of a rare disease. You're looking at about 150 specialty centers in the United States have actually prescribed this. So this -- we're not talking a large commercial footprint. This is more of a rare disease type of launch. And we've been focused on building out capabilities, particularly as we think about medical affairs, science liaisons and how do we manage the relationships, kind of the complex journey of patients facing these diseases with their physicians. A lot of work is already underway. So I'm quite confident we'll be prepared for our launch, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Because as Dean mentioned, our belief, what this can be globally is much bigger than when we originally did the deal given what we expect to be the label we will see. As far as the reimbursement goes, to your point, this drug, especially in the United States is very well known. The specialists in the area already understand it. They're already waiting for it. We know there are patients waiting for it. So I think you could expect a pretty fast uptake of the drug, especially in the United States. Outside the U.S., we're going to have to drive for reimbursement. That will take longer. But I think in both cases, our expectations and confidence in both the speed of uptake and the potential total volume or total revenue potential of this drug is more significant today than when we did the deal, just given the strength of the stellar results and what we continue to expect. So we're quite bullish on this. Yeah. And on the question of how we think about the oral PCSK9 and would we delay for an outcome study, I think it's too early to make that kind of decision because, frankly, how we think about the outcome study and whether or not, and what kind of label we get before we have an outcome study is still something we're working through. So we need to understand the label, we need to understand the timing of the outcome study. And until I know all those points, I wouldn't want to get ahead of where we would be. So more to come. We've got some time on that one. Yeah. Well, I appreciate everyone investing time today with the call. And just really maybe to conclude, I just want to reinforce how confident I am about how well positioned we are to continue to drive value creation for patients, for shareholders and for all of our stakeholders well into the future. And again, I just really want to thank all of my great colleagues across the globe for their substantial efforts. We really do look forward to building on the progress we have in the second half of 2023 and beyond. And hopefully, what you took from our comments today, both prepared and in the Q&A, is our confidence in the progress we're making and really, the difference we can make for patients across an ever broadening area of therapeutic possibility. So it's exciting what we have in front of us right now. Thank you."

These slides, along with the earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We began 2023 with significant advancements across key areas of our pipeline and with continued strong performance of our key growth drivers. I remain very pleased with the consistency and excellence of our team's execution, and I'm confident that our strategy is leading to sustainable success. We remain grounded in our shared purpose to bring forward bold science that delivered solutions, which address serious unmet medical needs and importantly, save and improve lives around the world. Our priorities remain consistent. By focusing on our science-led strategy, we intend to bring forward important innovation from our internal discovery pipeline and via strategic business development targeted at accessing the most compelling and complementary external science, leveraging our best-in-class clinical development capabilities. We aim to sustain the momentum in our pipeline in 2023 and beyond, and we're confident that this will lead to strong commercial and financial performance as well as value creation for patients and shareholders over the long term. Speaking of accessing important external innovation, we're very pleased with our announced acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences. Prometheus brings us a potential best-in-class novel treatment that could transform the standard of care for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, potentially debilitating conditions as well as a broader pipeline and a technology platform that enables a precision medicine approach. It accelerates our presence in immunology, increases the diversity of our pipeline and brings us a potentially significant revenue growth driver through the next decade. This transaction is also another example of Merck acting decisively when science and value align. Turning now to our first quarter results. We delivered very significant underlying growth, excluding the expected year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales. This reflects continued fundamental strength and momentum across our key growth drivers particularly in oncology and vaccines. These results reinforce our confidence in the robust demand for our innovative portfolio and in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Moving to our research organization. We've made significant advancements. In cardiovascular, we shared the remarkable work of our research colleagues at the American College of Cardiology Conference in March. The strength of the data from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial studying sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension reinforces our belief in this important new mechanisms potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients. In addition, impressive results from the Phase 2 trial studying our oral PCSK9 inhibitor suggests that this could be a globally accessible treatment option for patients in need of LDL-cholesterol reduction. The successes we are achieving across our cardiovascular pipeline have created excitement across our company and a belief that Merck will build on its strong legacy of bringing forth breakthrough therapies for the benefit of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and that these programs will contribute significantly to our long-term growth. In oncology, we were pleased to share the positive top line results from KEYNOTE-671, which showed a significant improvement in event-free survival in certain patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to potential approval later this year. In addition, we are working with our partner, Moderna to rapidly expand our efforts to study the combination of KEYTRUDA with an individualized neoantigen therapy, which we previously referred to as a personalized cancer vaccine therapy in adjuvant melanoma and potential additional tumor types. I'm very encouraged by the substantial progress we've made across our broad pipeline. We're now working on a greater number of late-stage programs across more therapeutic areas and modalities than at any time in recent years. In summary, we've begun 2023 with scientific, commercial and operational momentum and expect strong full year growth across both our Human and Animal Health businesses. I'm proud of the progress we've made, but as always recognize the need to move with speed and urgency to do even more. I want to thank our global team for their steadfast dedication as we build a sustainable innovation engine that will deliver value for patients and shareholders well into the next decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield : Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are off to a strong start to the year with robust underlying performance across our key growth pillars. These results further demonstrate but our focus on science and innovation as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is enabled by the excellent execution of our team of dedicated colleagues who are delivering our important medicines and vaccines to people and animals across the globe. We remain very confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short term while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.5 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong underlying growth of 15%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum, excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 18%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance with sales increasing 5% and driven by growth across both livestock and companion animal products. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $5.8 billion, driven by robust global demand for metastatic indications as well as increased utilization driven by approvals in early-stage cancers. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We continue to anticipate gradual uptake from KEYNOTE-091 in earlier stage lung cancer as we are working with the medical community to increase adjuvant treatment rates for diagnosed patients receiving surgery. We, along with others, are also working to improve upon the low level of lung cancer screenings and follow-up through diagnosis which we anticipate will increase over time. We are encouraged by the positive feedback received thus far. Furthermore, we are excited by the potential to bring an additional treatment option to patients following the positive results of the KEYNOTE-671 study. Together, these studies position us well to extend our leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. We also look forward to providing a new treatment option to certain adult patients with bladder cancer following the recent approval of KEYNOTE-869. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by uptake in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer as well as in earlier stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, which continues to launch in additional markets. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 8%, primarily due to increased demand in key European markets in certain patients with ovarian cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 5% due to increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in key European markets. Our vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which grew 43% to $2 billion. Performance was driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets particularly China as well as increased supply. Growth also benefited from an acceleration of shipments to China from the second half to the first half of the year to ensure the availability of product to meet heightened demand following the approval of the expanded indication of GARDASIL9 for girls and women, 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from the increasing demand for VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 27%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents. Our Animal Health business delivered another good quarter with sales increasing 5%, reflecting strong demand across our livestock portfolio, particularly in ruminant and poultry products as well as strategic price actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.9%, an increase of 6.1 percentage points due to favorable product mix, which reflects a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $6.7 billion, reflecting $1.4 billion of charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our license and collaboration agreement with Kelun. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 12% driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other income was $70 million. Our tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the Imago transaction, for which no tax benefit was recognized. Taken together, we earned $1.40 per share, which includes a $0.52 impact from charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now project revenue to be between $57.7 billion and $58.9 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. We expect strong underlying revenue growth of 8% to 10%, offset by the decline in LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. Our gross margin is still expected to be approximately 77%. We have narrowed the estimated range of operating expenses to be between $23.3 billion and $24.1 billion. As a reminder, this range includes $1.4 billion of upfront research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. This guidance does not assume the proposed acquisition of Prometheus or any additional significant potential business development transactions. Other income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $6.88 to $7.00. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4 percentage points, using mid-April rates. It is important to note that this guidance does not include the impact of the proposed acquisition of Prometheus, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. We expect the transaction will result in a one-time charge that will increase research and development expense of approximately $10.3 billion, or approximately $4 per share. The impact of this charge will be reflected in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. In addition, ongoing investment to advance the pipeline assets as well as the cost of financing will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.25 in the first 12 months following close. As Rob noted, we are very excited by Prometheus\u2019 compelling science and confident that this transaction has the potential to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business driven by our key pillars in Oncology, Vaccines, and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has achieved exceptional growth over the past several quarters driven by recent launches, particularly in early-stage indications, such as triple negative breast cancer. While we continue to anticipate growth from these earlier stage indications, the year-over-year growth rate is expected to moderate as we anniversary their very strong initial uptake. Outside the U.S., we continue to expect strong volume growth for KEYTRUDA; however, pricing is an increasing headwind, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets, which will temper ex-U.S. growth.  Finally, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. We are well positioned to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers now and over the long-term and given the strong global demand for the vaccine, we see an acceleration of growth for GARDASIL in the full year 2023 relative to 2022, though not quite at the same level of growth achieved this quarter.  Now shifting to capital allocation, where we remain committed to our priorities following the announcement to acquire Prometheus. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities we see. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority, and we maintain the ability within our strong investment grade credit rating to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year.  To conclude, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength, and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.  With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDr. Dean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Hello, everyone. Today, I will provide notable updates since the last earnings call, starting with our progress in cardiovascular disease, oncology, then infectious disease and subsequently immunology with our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. As Rob mentioned earlier, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans, results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as data from the Phase 2b trial for our oral PCSK9 inhibitor candidate, MK-0616, in development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, were presented.  In the STELLAR study, sotatercept, in combination with stable background therapy, met its primary endpoint with a substantial improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks compared to placebo in combination with background therapy. The trial also met 8 out of 9 secondary measures, including a compelling reduction in time to clinical worsening or death versus placebo. These findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are working diligently to submit filings from the STELLAR data to regulatory agencies and at this time, anticipate filing in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year followed by the EU.  We are advancing the broad sotatercept program, including the HYPERION, ZENITH, SOTERIA and Phase 2 CADENCE trials which are actively recruiting. Also at the ACC meeting, detailed Phase 2b results for MK-0616 were presented showing a reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels from 41.2 up to 60.9% versus placebo. Up to 90% of patients receiving MK-0616, at the highest dose studied, were able to reach their LDL-C goal. An oral PCSK9 inhibitor could provide the opportunity for broad, global access. We are initiating multiple Phase 3 studies including in secondary prevention; intermediate to high-risk primary prevention; and for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In parallel, we will conduct a cardiovascular outcomes trial. We are making progress towards our goal of developing medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients with cardiovascular diseases and look forward to providing updates in the future.  Turning to oncology. As I have mentioned previously, a key area of focus and execution has been the development of treatments for earlier stages of cancer where there remains significant unmet need. We announced FDA acceptance of our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant, followed by adjuvant therapy in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, based on the findings to date from the KEYNOTE-671 study. The Agency has set a PDUFA action date of October 16th and detailed findings will be presented at ASCO in June. Together, with the approval of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, based on KEYNOTE-091, the KEYNOTE-671 study builds on the wealth of data we have generated. Relevant additional ongoing studies include KEYNOTE-867 and KEYLYNK-012. This comprehensive development program, underscores our commitment to an area where there is significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Importantly, it also reinforces the need for early detection through lung cancer screening.  At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in collaboration with Moderna, we announced detailed results from KEYNOTE-942, a Phase 2b study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with V940 also known as mRNA-4157, an individualized neoantigen therapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of disease recurrence following complete resection. These results are the first to demonstrate improvement of recurrence-free survival over adjuvant standard of care PD-1 blockade in resected high-risk melanoma, and provide the first randomized evidence that an individualized neoantigen therapy has potential benefit. The FDA has granted this combination Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the European Medicines Agency has awarded PRIME designation for high-risk stage III and IV melanoma following complete resection. Merck and Moderna plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma this year, and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Together with Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This accelerated approval followed Priority Review and is based on data from the KEYNOTE-869 trial. This is an important advancement as this is the first U.S. approval of a regimen combining an anti-PD-1 therapy with an antibody-drug conjugate in these patients. The approval adds to the success of our foundational work evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and provides promising evidence for combining immunotherapy with tissue targeted anticancer agents. We are well positioned to build upon this work, with a portfolio of next generation antibody drug conjugates through our collaboration with Kelun Biotech.  Planning is underway for an expansive global clinical development program and we look forward to initiating Phase 3 trials for MK-2870, our TROP-2 targeting ADC, as both monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. We also announced that the FDA has accepted our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This filing is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 22% compared to chemotherapy alone in these patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The agency has set a PDUFA action date of December 16th. This provides us the opportunity to expand upon our approval for patients with HER2 positive disease based on KEYNOTE-811.  We recently announced positive data from the Phase 3 NRGGY018 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III to IV or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This is an important advancement for women with endometrial cancer building on our approvals from KEYNOTE-146, 775 and 158.  Earlier this year the American Cancer Society\u2019s 2023 annual report on cancer facts and trends, noted that survival for uterine malignancies had not improved over the past four decades due to a lack of treatment advances. We continue our work to provide better treatment options in women\u2019s cancers. And finally the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a significant and growing unmet need and therefore an area of ongoing commitment. We have gained important insights to date from our trials evaluating KEYTRUDA and Lynparza and are planning to initiate Phase 3 studies of MK-5684, a novel oral, nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP-11A1, from our collaboration with Orion, by the end of this year. Also, with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the discussion regarding the PROpel study at the upcoming oncologic drugs advisory committee meeting. We are proud of the progress we are making and look forward to hosting an investor event at ASCO in Chicago. Please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 5th where we will provide an update on our oncology strategy and development program. Turning to the progress of our infectious disease program. We are now actively enrolling multiple new Phase 3 studies for once-daily islatravir in combination with doravirine and, with Gilead, have resumed the Phase 2 study of an oral once-weekly combination treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead\u2019s lenacapavir. We are committed to advancing the science to offer new treatment options for the treatment of HIV. On LAGEVRIO, we continue to prioritize global access during surges of COVID-19 around the world, including in Japan, where the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare recently granted full approval for the treatment of COVID-19. We are proceeding with the evaluation of LAGEVRIO for the treatment of other viral respiratory infections and will share more as studies read out.  Finally, to our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. Prometheus offers a strong scientific pedigree with a candidate that has shown exciting potential in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. TNF-like 1A is, a novel target, which provides the potential opportunity to transform standard of care in a disease area where current therapies are often inadequate and high unmet need remains. Prometheus' anti-TL1A antibody, PRA023, is a potential first-in-class late-stage clinical candidate with a unique dual mechanism of action including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. PRA023's Phase 2 results in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s Disease demonstrated strong efficacy. Further, at an interim analysis, the data in the biomarker positive sub population suggested even greater efficacy with patients more likely to achieve clinical remission. By combining Prometheus' deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease and Merck's deep expertise in developing and implementing biomarkers, we hope to usher in a new era in Immunology where patients are matched with the right therapy based on a precision medicine approach. Prometheus' biobank of IBD specimens has yielded deep molecular insights that formed the foundation for the discovery of PRA052 and we look forward to building on that knowledge to gain further insights which will enable the identification and prioritization of additional targets.  In closing, we continue to make progress towards our goal of creating innovative medicines that will improve the outcomes for patients.  And now I turn the call back to Peter\nPeter Dannenbaum: clinical candidate with a unique dual mechanism of action, including anti inflammatory and anti fibrotic properties. PRA023 Phase 2 results in both Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease demonstrated strong efficacy. Further at an interim analysis, the data and the biomarker positive subpopulation suggested even greater efficacy with patients more likely to achieve clinical remission. By combining Prometheus' deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease, and Merck's deep expertise in developing and implementing biomarkers. We hope to usher in a new era in immunology, where patients are matched with the right therapy based on a precision medicine approach. Prometheus's biobank of IBD specimens have yielded deep molecular insights that form the foundation for the discovery of PRA052 and we look forward to building on that knowledge to gain further insights, which will enable the identification and prioritization of additional targets.  In closing, we continue to make progress towards our goal of creating innovative medicines that will improve the outcomes for patients.  And now I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum : Thank you, Dean. Michelle, we're ready for Q&A. I'd like to ask analysts to limit themselves to one question today, we'd like to complete the call by the top of the hour. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Robert Cusick] on for Terrance. You and your partner Moderna are conducting a Phase 1 basket trial of the PCV. Can you elaborate on the design of the trial? And if you have any of the data in-house at this point? Thanks.\nDr. Dean Li: Yes. Thank you. This is Dean. I probably want to just focus really on the Phase 3s that we're advancing in melanoma and likely in others. There is a basket trial that's going through to look at the extent of the tumors that a joint sort of KEYTRUDA plus a personalized or individualized new antigen therapy will work. I can just give you a general sense. We have a little bit of a roadmap as to where immune sensitive tumors are, and we would likely prioritize those in our basket trial.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next caller is Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: So my question is actually on the Kelun Bio opportunity. Dean, just hoping if you could update us, I believe, previously, it was stated that we may see some longer-term data later this year. Just hoping to see if that is still the case or if competitive dynamics have kind of changed that commitment? And maybe if you could just help us understand your enthusiasm for that particular product and where you feel it would be likely differentiated from other products in the category?\nDr. Dean Li : I'll just answer by the competitive dynamics make us more enthusiastic to push our programs harder and faster. We will be providing data from the data that we have in a series of cancers at ASCO on June 5th. We'll have an investor, but it will also be in the ASCO, I believe, already accepted for presentation there as well. So we're very interested in that. And we're also very interested in the fact that -- as we know, the first evidence of anti-PD-1 with an antibody drug conjugates and our collaboration with Seagen has shown good effect, and we postulate that, that may be a broader impact, not just with one ADC or one indication, but more broadly, through multiple antibody drug conjugates and therefore, our interest in advancing not just the TROP2 ADC but many other ADCs that we haven't provided data as of this point.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Luisa Hector from Berenberg.\nLuisa Hector: I wondered if you could give us an update on KEYTRUDA. Your -- how it's looking in the adjuvant lung setting and relative positioning against your competitor and how any subcutaneous formulation might change that either from the competitor or you? And when might we have that Phase 3 data on your newer former of the subcutaneous?\nDr. Dean Li : Let me just grab the question about the early-stage lung. As we've talked, the earlier stages are really important. We've already seen it in triple-negative breast cancer. We've seen it in RCC. We've seen it in melanoma. And I think the aperture of being able to do it in the lung is going to be substantial. Again, for our KEYNOTE-671, which is the first perioperative trial to announce a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS and statistically significant improvement in pathologic complete response. Those will be presented in June as well. I would also emphasize that event-free survival and overall survival are the primary endpoints of our study, and most competitors do not have OS as a primary endpoint I would also emphasize that this is also in the setting where we have perioperative, but we also have adjuvant as well. So we provide a broad treatment choice in relationship to moving forward in the earlier stage. In all earlier stage, whether it be lung, triple-negative, RCC, melanoma, I think it will be increasingly important to provide innovation that allows patients to have \"more normal\" ability to stay on these treatments long-term, there are different profiles than a metastatic patient. And so we believe that giving other routes of administration will be important. And we're advancing our subcu pembrolizumab, especially with higher round of base because that gives us an ability to do both a 3 weeks and importantly, also allows us to do a Q6 weeks because that frequency, I think, will be very important for patients.\nRobert Davis: And Luisa, I might just add from a commercial perspective, the early stage launch and lung with KEYNOTE-091 is off to a good start. We're actually seeing good uptake. As you know, the challenge here is that the overall screening rates are lower. So it's going to be a slower climb than what we saw, for instance, or we have been seeing with triple-negative breast cancer. But as we sit here today, the launch is going well. And as we look forward, and hopefully, once we -- with the potential approval of KEYNOTE-671, we'll be the only company that has both adjuvant and neoadjuvant offerings as well as, obviously, a leadership position in the metastatic setting. So as we sit here today, we continue to see this as a meaningful opportunity and long term will continue to drive growth for us in long. But obviously, we've got to get that going to do that in the adjuvant setting. From a metastatic perspective, we're continuing to hold our leadership position.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Luisa. Next question, please.\nOperator: Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Great. For sotatercept, certainly, a broad scope of potential not just from the stellar results, but in earlier and later line, you have HYPERION and ZENITH. Can you remind us if there's potential for interim readouts and if so, potential what time line? And relatedly, what are you thinking about in terms of your overall sort of PH -- PAH strategy? You have assets now with Prometheus as well that have potential to be used in the systemic sclerosis ILD population, a lot of opportunity. If you can just help frame some strategic thinking?\nDr. Dean Li : Yes. I would just focus on the pulmonary artery hypertension. I would kind of keep that a little bit distinct from other forms of lung disease, one is a primary vascular. The other one is, I could say, primary parenchyma. So I kind of separate diseases like IPF and interstitial lung disease from scleroderma as distinct from those like pulmonary arterial hypertension. You're right. We believe that sotatercept will be important. We are pushing forward with that sotatercept with STELLAR. We have ZENITH, HYPERION. There are interim analysis, but I don't actually want to sort of lay out, many of them are event-driven. The ZENITH, as you well know, is really in a more advanced situation in HYPERION is really trying to get it more in the front line. We also believe that it will potentially reshape how people think about the treatment of PAH largely people thought about vasodilation or dilation. I think this mechanism is active in signaling inhibitor with the mechanism that it has, which remodels, the tissue will reshape the field and in reshaping it, it will potentially reshape the dynamics of the vasodilatory pathways and that's why we're so excited with our inhaled SGC program, MK-5475 because we think that could be a very important combination agent with other vasodilatory mechanisms that are already approved as well as in combination with sotatercept.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please.\nOperator: Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nHardik Parikh: This is Hardik Parikh calling in for Chris Schott. Just one question on the BD front. So when you're thinking about the progress that you guys have had in internal pipeline and then now you have the Prometheus deal, is there a priority or a bias when you consider business development from either early or later stage deals or from therapeutic areas, oncology, CV or maybe some emerging therapeutic areas in your portfolio?\nRobert Davis: Yes. No, I appreciate the question. So obviously, in our view of this is really unchanged despite what you've seen us do both recently and to the fact you made -- point you made, we're seeing good progress in our internal pipeline. It starts with asking the question, where do we see the most compelling science that we think we can use to make a difference for an unmet need and it has a strategic fit and where we see value aligned. And that's where we move. As we sit here today, we continue to believe there are opportunities for us to continue to do business development. We are very, I would say, pleased with the progress of the internal pipeline. And as you look about the therapeutic areas where we have been adding, obviously, areas where you continue to see great science happening in oncology. There's a lot of science in oncology, immunology and we've seen in cardiovascular. So what's been driving us to the therapeutic areas has been the scientific opportunity we've seen. And as we think about early versus late, it really will depend on the confidence the scientific team has and the particular opportunity. So we don't target 1 versus the other. Although I will tell you, we continue to not believe that going after commercialized assets just for the sake of revenue is not our strategy. We're focused on building the pipeline, both near and long term, and we do deals across the full spectrum. We talk about the acquisitions in the Phase 2, Phase 3 area, but we don't talk a lot about the fact we're doing a lot of collaborations and other licensing deals in their early phase.  So we really look at the phase of development and always will be driven by the pipeline. If it brings with it a commercial opportunity, great, but it always will have to have a pipeline element for us to want to go there.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: I guess for Rob and Caroline, would love to kind of hear your latest thoughts on sort of the EU proposed legislation and how that potentially changes how you think about launching drugs in Europe? And I guess also, I guess the read-through would be also to how potential business development as well? And as you think about the timing of the revenues and potentially shorter exclusivity periods? Any thoughts on that front would be helpful.\nRobert Davis: Yes. So if you look at what the EU just put out, obviously, the high-level message is overall on balance, we are concerned that it continues to put innovation at a disadvantage in Europe and puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage as we think about where to invest our dollars and where to bring new products. Now that said, on balance, there were elements of what were proposed that actually we support. There are elements that we think need to be changed.  On the side of the support, clearly, the fact that they have made some efforts to simplify and modernize the regulatory framework, which has the potential to accelerate approvals. That was very much something the industry pushed for, and we feel good about. But as you point out, the area that balances that, that is very concerning is the fact that they have reduced the data exclusivity period and made it largely contingent upon you're launching in across the member states, whether or not you're doing comparative studies and whether or not you have launches. So we need to understand that. We're going to continue to try to make sure people understand the implications that can have as we think about where we would launch products, and that's work we will do. We have a couple of years probably before this is put in place. So we have time to do the negotiation. As I sit here today, I wouldn't say that I see specific implications to our business development strategy, it's more of just the general theme of what is a push against innovation that concerns us because Europe is an important market, getting access to our medicines to the people in the European Union is important. We want to be there. We just have to make sure it's sustainable from a business perspective.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Carter. Next question.\nOperator: Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson: I have a question on GARDASIL and China. So the GSA contract from your Chinese distributor published a couple of months ago shows really big purchase orders consistently for the next few years and it kind of trails off and declines. And it's interpreted literally it could suggest there was kind of a bolus effect going on where growth isn't linear. It goes up for a while, then it contracts as you work through warehouse patients. Is that how we should think about the longer-term uptake of GARDASIL in that particular market that it might not be linear?\nRobert Davis: Yes. Just -- so if you look at the GSA contract, it's important to understand that the levels put in that contract are minimums. And in fact, we have shown and our history has been that actually we have supplied well over the minimum. So I wouldn't interpret that as the literal forecast of the business in China because there's opportunities with the expanded age cohorts as we continue to drive penetration in what is still a large unmet population, there is opportunities to do better than what's in that contract. And if history isn't indicative of the future, we would expect to see that move forward. So I would not interpret that as implying a decline in GARDASIL in China over the coming years.\nCaroline Litchfield: The only thing I would add is from a research perspective, we remain focused on studies in China to support gender-neutral vaccination, which could be a great opportunity to protect more lives and provide growth into the future.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Tim. Next question, please.\nOperator: Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Ng Ma] hopping on for Evan. We wanted to ask with the sotatercept Phase 3 data, the Prometheus deal and novel assets like the oral PCSK9, does the team now think that this will be enough to grow through the KEYTRUDA LOE?\nRobert Davis: Yes. I'll take the question, Evan. Obviously, I would start by saying we feel very good about the progress we've made in a very short period of time. So if you look at the opportunity to be in a situation to have sustainable growth well into the next decade. We feel like we've made significant progress. Whether it's -- as you point out, the deal with Acceleron and then I would add the broad and strong internal pipeline we have in cardiovascular that as you know, we've indicated has 8 potential launches in the '24 to '28 timeframe, which has the potential to generate more than $10 billion as we move into the mid-2030s. We talked about the fact from an oncology perspective. If you look at what we have from an ADC portfolio and a lot of the small molecules, we've brought in through business development, excluding anything from the individualized neoantigen therapy, formally what we used to call the personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna. So that's not even counted. We see greater than $10 billion of opportunity from those assets in that same time frame. So as we sit here today, we've made a lot of progress. I don't want to predict to I think we're in a position to grow or not. We're not giving specific guidance. But I would say I feel, given the rate of progress we've made in such a short period of time and given the timetable we have and our resources going forward and the progress that Dean is driving with his team in our labs, I am no longer focusing on 2028. I am looking at how do we have sustainable growth well into the next decade?\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Question for Dean. Could you talk to the planned cardiovascular outcome trial for your oral PCSK9, in particular, how you balance some of the historic data supporting the idea that in trial treatment duration is closely tied to efficacy and the parenterals were probably dosed for too short a time suggesting that you need to have a longer trial versus, on the other hand, the impact of the IRA contending returns at least in the Medicare population in the U.S.?\nDr. Dean Li : Thank you very much for that question. First of all, I just want to emphasize that we're in active discussions with regulatory agencies in relationship to our program as we define the Phase 3 trial. So that will put out there. The second point I would just emphasize is there is an evolving view that I think the field is coming to grips with. It's not just that LDL is an excellent biomarker. It's not just that PCSK9 is an excellent pathway. It is the fact that our 0616 interdicts exactly in the same place as some of the antibodies how 1 interprets that and how it thinks about biomarker data in that setting, I think it will be an evolving discussion with the regulatory agencies. The second question that you point out is the historic in the previous. I think you're referring to the fact that there is a view that if those studies with the antibodies had gone out a little bit longer, that they would have had a more profound impact in terms of outcomes. Those are things that we are speaking to the regulatory agencies as they think about the difference between the biomarker and the outcomes trial. But I do -- I would echo your point of view, which is one doesn't want to go too short that one risks the full maximum impact that you can have on the label. But that, as you said, needs to be balanced with whatever the IRA looks like how many years from now. So those are the balances. But your observation about the other trials is 1 that we observed as well. And my general thinking is we should try to maximize the impact that we have on patients because whatever that label is, that label will stay forever.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\nOperator: Mara Goldstein with Mizuho.\nMara Goldstein: I wanted to also ask a question on the personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna. Coming out of AACR, the response rate for the monotherapy arm, the KEYTRUDA arm seemed low relative to some of the sort of historical comparisons. And I'm wondering if you could speak to that, particularly in light of what we have seen for other therapeutics that are being tested against KEYTRUDA monotherapy comparators?\nDr. Dean Li : Yes. So let me just state that it's always something that we do and everyone else does, which is this cross-trial comparison between companies, but also within companies and their own agent. What I will say is that some of the issues that have been discussed was the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm performed comparably to KEYNOTE-054 in the high-risk subgroups, which is 3C and D. and those were also included in the KEYNOTE-942. And in general, the KEYNOTE-942 had more advanced disease than those in KEYNOTE-054. So there is a way for us to sort of probabilitized given the same stage. So we're very comfortable with the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm in the trial that Merck and Moderna proceeded with. I just want to just reemphasize that this to us is an important development scientifically. This is really the first time that I can recall seeing the impact of a personalized or individualized neoantigen therapy or a personalized cancer vaccine that has that profound of a readout in a Phase 2. So we're excited to advance that to Phase 3 for melanoma and to spool up other trials in Phase 3 as we look to see how far we can push this strategy.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Mara. Next question, please.\nOperator: Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Dean, on TIGIT, we know the doublet arm was not going to meet the PFS. So by extension, the triplet may have a shot at meeting PFS. And my question is, what is your confidence in getting to at least a 20% benefit or so on PFS? And if that plays out, you just wait for Phase 3? Do you speak to regulator? Like what happens next, considering the second line trial?\nDr. Dean Li : So I would just emphasize that I think you're speaking about the Phase 2 trial. And those Phase 2 trials do provide us sort of views of how to think about the 5 Phase 3 trials that we have ongoing. I will just say that those 5 Phase 3 trials are going to be the thing that the FDA looks at. That's what they're going to look at and we're advancing those. And we're advancing them not just in metastatic situations. We have a series of them in lung. But I also just want to emphasize something that I've said previously. It relates to what people have said about KEYNOTE-671. It relates to the question about individualized neoantigen therapy, and it will relate here. When we think about IO strategies and especially IO plus IO strategies, increasingly, our eyes are turning into the earlier stages of diseases both because it's very important for patients. It's a time where we can really interdict early, but we also think that, that's an important place for us to relook on all of our assets that are IO-IO in that earlier stage.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Umer. Next question, please.\nOperator: Daina Graybosch with SVB Securities.\nDaina Graybosch: Related to the previous two in your answer, Dean, in early-stage melanoma it looks like you're going to be pursuing 2 Phase 3 combinations in parallel, adding on your TIGIT vivo and adding on the individualized neoantigen therapy. I wonder if you could talk to why you're taking two large shot goal in the same indication? And should we expect a similar strategy generally? And for these two add-ons specifically and other early-stage indications?\nDr. Dean Li : Yes. So I would just step back for just a moment. Our ability to go into earlier-stage cancers were just unlocked maybe a couple of years ago, right? And in order to do combinations, it's very important that your base molecule actually has an impact because that allows you to do contributions of components. So we're very comfortable moving our IO-IO strategies in earlier stages. We are doing it, as you said, both for pembro and TIGIT and as well as pembro plus the individualized neoantigen therapy. We're very confident that the desire of patients to be there is substantial. And our ability to recruit and do an important trial there is also important. I would also say that as you see more readouts of earlier-stage cancer for any of our assets, whether it be Lynparza, whether it be an ADC or whether it be KEYTRUDA, it will be likely that we will target multiple combinations in those spaces.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Daina. We're going to try to get to two more questions, please.\nOperator: Colin Bristow with UBS.\nYihan Li: This is Yihan on for Colin. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the quarter. So another question on KEYTRUDA. So how much of a protective strategy in terms of the exclusivity could the subcutaneous formulation of the KEYTRUDA would afford you?\nRobert Davis: Yes. So I appreciate the question. As we look at the subcutaneous formulation and where that can be utilized, obviously, it's focused more where we have monotherapy as we look at earlier lines of therapy. So as we continue to advance our adjuvant and new adjuvant strategy across multiple tumor types and then where we are combining KEYTRUDA with small molecules. Based on what we see, as we look out, we would expect about half of what we have as KEYTRUDA would be addressable through the subcutaneous route based on that definition of those areas.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you. Final question, please.\nOperator: Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse.\nTrung Huynh: Just a quick one. Given your renewed interest in immunology, I just wanted to ask about gefapixant. GSK recently bought a product with a similar mechanism of action for around $2 billion. They had described peak sales in the single billion dollar range. So perhaps can you just give us an update of where gefapixant is post the CRL that you have? And what's your expectations for this opportunity?\nDr. Dean Li : Yes, I'll start with that. So as you recall, gefapixant, we had positive Phase 3 trials. We had a CRL. The CRL has nothing to do with the safety or really any major concern that would require another clinical trial. The focus was on the way that the analysis was done in the way that costs were counted. We have submitted additional analysis and will be submitting additional analysis to the FDA in the first half of this 2023 in general, I believe that the timing is that on submission of all of that data, generally speaking, the FDA then readdresses CRL in within 6 months. We have it already approved in Japan and Switzerland. And as you said, there is a renewed interest given the recent transaction, and I don't know if Caroline, would you like to answer that?\nCaroline Litchfield: So I would just add that today, this is a population that is very underserved, one in 10 people here in the United States have chronic cough. So it's a market that will need to be built. But should we be successful with our work with the FDA, we look forward to bringing forward an option that will be beneficial to patients and will drive revenue for our company.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Trung, and thank you all for your very good questions today. We look forward to hearing from you and engaging with you in the future. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we are off to a strong start to the year with robust underlying performance across our key growth pillars. These results further demonstrate but our focus on science and innovation as the core of our strategy is working. Our success is enabled by the excellent execution of our team of dedicated colleagues who are delivering our important medicines and vaccines to people and animals across the globe. We remain very confident in our ability to continue to deliver in the short term while we make disciplined investments to maximize long-term value for patients and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $14.5 billion. Excluding the impact from LAGEVRIO and foreign exchange, the business delivered very strong underlying growth of 15%. The remainder of my revenue comments will be on an ex exchange basis. Our human health business continued its strong momentum, excluding LAGEVRIO, growth was 18%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance with sales increasing 5% and driven by growth across both livestock and companion animal products. Now turning to the first quarter performance of our key brands. In oncology, KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $5.8 billion, driven by robust global demand for metastatic indications as well as increased utilization driven by approvals in early-stage cancers. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across all key tumor types and continues to benefit from uptake in earlier stage cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer as well as in certain types of renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. We continue to anticipate gradual uptake from KEYNOTE-091 in earlier stage lung cancer as we are working with the medical community to increase adjuvant treatment rates for diagnosed patients receiving surgery. We, along with others, are also working to improve upon the low level of lung cancer screenings and follow-up through diagnosis which we anticipate will increase over time. We are encouraged by the positive feedback received thus far. Furthermore, we are excited by the potential to bring an additional treatment option to patients following the positive results of the KEYNOTE-671 study. Together, these studies position us well to extend our leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. We also look forward to providing a new treatment option to certain adult patients with bladder cancer following the recent approval of KEYNOTE-869. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA continues to maintain its leadership in non-small cell lung cancer. Growth was driven by uptake in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and certain types of head and neck cancer as well as in earlier stage cancers, including certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, which continues to launch in additional markets. Lynparza remains the market-leading PARP inhibitor. Alliance revenue grew 8%, primarily due to increased demand in key European markets in certain patients with ovarian cancer. Lenvima alliance revenue grew 5% due to increased uptake in the treatment of certain patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma in key European markets. Our vaccines portfolio delivered excellent growth led by GARDASIL, which grew 43% to $2 billion. Performance was driven by strong demand in major ex-U.S. markets particularly China as well as increased supply. Growth also benefited from an acceleration of shipments to China from the second half to the first half of the year to ensure the availability of product to meet heightened demand following the approval of the expanded indication of GARDASIL9 for girls and women, 9 to 45 years of age. Vaccine sales also benefited from the increasing demand for VAXNEUVANCE following the ongoing pediatric launch, particularly in the U.S. In our hospital acute care portfolio, BRIDION sales grew 27%, driven by an increase in market share among neuromuscular blockade reversal agents. Our Animal Health business delivered another good quarter with sales increasing 5%, reflecting strong demand across our livestock portfolio, particularly in ruminant and poultry products as well as strategic price actions. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 76.9%, an increase of 6.1 percentage points due to favorable product mix, which reflects a benefit from the lower sales of LAGEVRIO. Operating expenses increased to $6.7 billion, reflecting $1.4 billion of charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our license and collaboration agreement with Kelun. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 12% driven by increased investments to support our key growth drivers and pipeline. Other income was $70 million. Our tax rate was 20.4%, reflecting the unfavorable impact from the Imago transaction, for which no tax benefit was recognized. Taken together, we earned $1.40 per share, which includes a $0.52 impact from charges related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. Turning now to our 2023 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business enables us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now project revenue to be between $57.7 billion and $58.9 billion, including approximately $1 billion from LAGEVRIO. We expect strong underlying revenue growth of 8% to 10%, offset by the decline in LAGEVRIO and an approximate 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-April rates. Our gross margin is still expected to be approximately 77%. We have narrowed the estimated range of operating expenses to be between $23.3 billion and $24.1 billion. As a reminder, this range includes $1.4 billion of upfront research and development expenses related to the acquisition of Imago and our agreement with Kelun. This guidance does not assume the proposed acquisition of Prometheus or any additional significant potential business development transactions. Other income is anticipated to be approximately $250 million. We continue to assume a full year tax rate between 17% and 18% and approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $6.88 to $7.00. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 4 percentage points, using mid-April rates. It is important to note that this guidance does not include the impact of the proposed acquisition of Prometheus, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. We expect the transaction will result in a one-time charge that will increase research and development expense of approximately $10.3 billion, or approximately $4 per share. The impact of this charge will be reflected in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. In addition, ongoing investment to advance the pipeline assets as well as the cost of financing will negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.25 in the first 12 months following close. As Rob noted, we are very excited by Prometheus' compelling science and confident that this transaction has the potential to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. Our guidance reflects our continued confidence in the underlying strength of our business driven by our key pillars in Oncology, Vaccines, and Animal Health. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA has achieved exceptional growth over the past several quarters driven by recent launches, particularly in early-stage indications, such as triple negative breast cancer. While we continue to anticipate growth from these earlier stage indications, the year-over-year growth rate is expected to moderate as we anniversary their very strong initial uptake. Outside the U.S., we continue to expect strong volume growth for KEYTRUDA; however, pricing is an increasing headwind, particularly as we launch new indications in key European markets, which will temper ex-U.S. growth.  Finally, we are confident in our ability to drive strong growth of GARDASIL, particularly in international markets. We are well positioned to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers now and over the long-term and given the strong global demand for the vaccine, we see an acceleration of growth for GARDASIL in the full year 2023 relative to 2022, though not quite at the same level of growth achieved this quarter.  Now shifting to capital allocation, where we remain committed to our priorities following the announcement to acquire Prometheus. We will continue to prioritize investments in our business and growing pipeline to realize the value of the many near and long-term opportunities we see. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a high priority, and we maintain the ability within our strong investment grade credit rating to pursue additional, science driven, value enhancing transactions going forward. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases this year.  To conclude, we remain very confident in the outlook of our business driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. We are in a position of financial and operational strength, and our continued excellent execution will enable us to deliver value to patients and shareholders well into the future.  With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. The only thing I would add is from a research perspective, we remain focused on studies in China to support gender-neutral vaccination, which could be a great opportunity to protect more lives and provide growth into the future. So I would just add that today, this is a population that is very underserved, one in 10 people here in the United States have chronic cough. So it's a market that will need to be built. But should we be successful with our work with the FDA, we look forward to bringing forward an option that will be beneficial to patients and will drive revenue for our company."

            "name": "Robert Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We began 2023 with significant advancements across key areas of our pipeline and with continued strong performance of our key growth drivers. I remain very pleased with the consistency and excellence of our team's execution, and I'm confident that our strategy is leading to sustainable success. We remain grounded in our shared purpose to bring forward bold science that delivered solutions, which address serious unmet medical needs and importantly, save and improve lives around the world. Our priorities remain consistent. By focusing on our science-led strategy, we intend to bring forward important innovation from our internal discovery pipeline and via strategic business development targeted at accessing the most compelling and complementary external science, leveraging our best-in-class clinical development capabilities. We aim to sustain the momentum in our pipeline in 2023 and beyond, and we're confident that this will lead to strong commercial and financial performance as well as value creation for patients and shareholders over the long term. Speaking of accessing important external innovation, we're very pleased with our announced acquisition of Prometheus Biosciences. Prometheus brings us a potential best-in-class novel treatment that could transform the standard of care for patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, potentially debilitating conditions as well as a broader pipeline and a technology platform that enables a precision medicine approach. It accelerates our presence in immunology, increases the diversity of our pipeline and brings us a potentially significant revenue growth driver through the next decade. This transaction is also another example of Merck acting decisively when science and value align. Turning now to our first quarter results. We delivered very significant underlying growth, excluding the expected year-over-year decline in LAGEVRIO sales. This reflects continued fundamental strength and momentum across our key growth drivers particularly in oncology and vaccines. These results reinforce our confidence in the robust demand for our innovative portfolio and in our outlook for the remainder of 2023, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Moving to our research organization. We've made significant advancements. In cardiovascular, we shared the remarkable work of our research colleagues at the American College of Cardiology Conference in March. The strength of the data from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial studying sotatercept in pulmonary arterial hypertension reinforces our belief in this important new mechanisms potential to change the treatment paradigm for patients. In addition, impressive results from the Phase 2 trial studying our oral PCSK9 inhibitor suggests that this could be a globally accessible treatment option for patients in need of LDL-cholesterol reduction. The successes we are achieving across our cardiovascular pipeline have created excitement across our company and a belief that Merck will build on its strong legacy of bringing forth breakthrough therapies for the benefit of patients suffering from cardiovascular disease and that these programs will contribute significantly to our long-term growth. In oncology, we were pleased to share the positive top line results from KEYNOTE-671, which showed a significant improvement in event-free survival in certain patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, and we look forward to potential approval later this year. In addition, we are working with our partner, Moderna to rapidly expand our efforts to study the combination of KEYTRUDA with an individualized neoantigen therapy, which we previously referred to as a personalized cancer vaccine therapy in adjuvant melanoma and potential additional tumor types. I'm very encouraged by the substantial progress we've made across our broad pipeline. We're now working on a greater number of late-stage programs across more therapeutic areas and modalities than at any time in recent years. In summary, we've begun 2023 with scientific, commercial and operational momentum and expect strong full year growth across both our Human and Animal Health businesses. I'm proud of the progress we've made, but as always recognize the need to move with speed and urgency to do even more. I want to thank our global team for their steadfast dedication as we build a sustainable innovation engine that will deliver value for patients and shareholders well into the next decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. And Luisa, I might just add from a commercial perspective, the early stage launch and lung with KEYNOTE-091 is off to a good start. We're actually seeing good uptake. As you know, the challenge here is that the overall screening rates are lower. So it's going to be a slower climb than what we saw, for instance, or we have been seeing with triple-negative breast cancer. But as we sit here today, the launch is going well. And as we look forward, and hopefully, once we -- with the potential approval of KEYNOTE-671, we'll be the only company that has both adjuvant and neoadjuvant offerings as well as, obviously, a leadership position in the metastatic setting. So as we sit here today, we continue to see this as a meaningful opportunity and long term will continue to drive growth for us in long. But obviously, we've got to get that going to do that in the adjuvant setting. From a metastatic perspective, we're continuing to hold our leadership position. Yes. No, I appreciate the question. So obviously, in our view of this is really unchanged despite what you've seen us do both recently and to the fact you made -- point you made, we're seeing good progress in our internal pipeline. It starts with asking the question, where do we see the most compelling science that we think we can use to make a difference for an unmet need and it has a strategic fit and where we see value aligned. And that's where we move. As we sit here today, we continue to believe there are opportunities for us to continue to do business development. We are very, I would say, pleased with the progress of the internal pipeline. And as you look about the therapeutic areas where we have been adding, obviously, areas where you continue to see great science happening in oncology. There's a lot of science in oncology, immunology and we've seen in cardiovascular. So what's been driving us to the therapeutic areas has been the scientific opportunity we've seen. And as we think about early versus late, it really will depend on the confidence the scientific team has and the particular opportunity. So we don't target 1 versus the other. Although I will tell you, we continue to not believe that going after commercialized assets just for the sake of revenue is not our strategy. We're focused on building the pipeline, both near and long term, and we do deals across the full spectrum. We talk about the acquisitions in the Phase 2, Phase 3 area, but we don't talk a lot about the fact we're doing a lot of collaborations and other licensing deals in their early phase.  So we really look at the phase of development and always will be driven by the pipeline. If it brings with it a commercial opportunity, great, but it always will have to have a pipeline element for us to want to go there. Yes. So if you look at what the EU just put out, obviously, the high-level message is overall on balance, we are concerned that it continues to put innovation at a disadvantage in Europe and puts Europe at a competitive disadvantage as we think about where to invest our dollars and where to bring new products. Now that said, on balance, there were elements of what were proposed that actually we support. There are elements that we think need to be changed.  On the side of the support, clearly, the fact that they have made some efforts to simplify and modernize the regulatory framework, which has the potential to accelerate approvals. That was very much something the industry pushed for, and we feel good about. But as you point out, the area that balances that, that is very concerning is the fact that they have reduced the data exclusivity period and made it largely contingent upon you're launching in across the member states, whether or not you're doing comparative studies and whether or not you have launches. So we need to understand that. We're going to continue to try to make sure people understand the implications that can have as we think about where we would launch products, and that's work we will do. We have a couple of years probably before this is put in place. So we have time to do the negotiation. As I sit here today, I wouldn't say that I see specific implications to our business development strategy, it's more of just the general theme of what is a push against innovation that concerns us because Europe is an important market, getting access to our medicines to the people in the European Union is important. We want to be there. We just have to make sure it's sustainable from a business perspective. Yes. Just -- so if you look at the GSA contract, it's important to understand that the levels put in that contract are minimums. And in fact, we have shown and our history has been that actually we have supplied well over the minimum. So I wouldn't interpret that as the literal forecast of the business in China because there's opportunities with the expanded age cohorts as we continue to drive penetration in what is still a large unmet population, there is opportunities to do better than what's in that contract. And if history isn't indicative of the future, we would expect to see that move forward. So I would not interpret that as implying a decline in GARDASIL in China over the coming years. Yes. I'll take the question, Evan. Obviously, I would start by saying we feel very good about the progress we've made in a very short period of time. So if you look at the opportunity to be in a situation to have sustainable growth well into the next decade. We feel like we've made significant progress. Whether it's -- as you point out, the deal with Acceleron and then I would add the broad and strong internal pipeline we have in cardiovascular that as you know, we've indicated has 8 potential launches in the '24 to '28 timeframe, which has the potential to generate more than $10 billion as we move into the mid-2030s. We talked about the fact from an oncology perspective. If you look at what we have from an ADC portfolio and a lot of the small molecules, we've brought in through business development, excluding anything from the individualized neoantigen therapy, formally what we used to call the personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna. So that's not even counted. We see greater than $10 billion of opportunity from those assets in that same time frame. So as we sit here today, we've made a lot of progress. I don't want to predict to I think we're in a position to grow or not. We're not giving specific guidance. But I would say I feel, given the rate of progress we've made in such a short period of time and given the timetable we have and our resources going forward and the progress that Dean is driving with his team in our labs, I am no longer focusing on 2028. I am looking at how do we have sustainable growth well into the next decade? Yes. So I appreciate the question. As we look at the subcutaneous formulation and where that can be utilized, obviously, it's focused more where we have monotherapy as we look at earlier lines of therapy. So as we continue to advance our adjuvant and new adjuvant strategy across multiple tumor types and then where we are combining KEYTRUDA with small molecules. Based on what we see, as we look out, we would expect about half of what we have as KEYTRUDA would be addressable through the subcutaneous route based on that definition of those areas."

            "name": "Dr. Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Hello, everyone. Today, I will provide notable updates since the last earnings call, starting with our progress in cardiovascular disease, oncology, then infectious disease and subsequently immunology with our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. As Rob mentioned earlier, at the American College of Cardiology in conjunction with the World Congress of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans, results from the Phase 3 STELLAR trial, evaluating sotatercept for pulmonary arterial hypertension, as well as data from the Phase 2b trial for our oral PCSK9 inhibitor candidate, MK-0616, in development for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, were presented.  In the STELLAR study, sotatercept, in combination with stable background therapy, met its primary endpoint with a substantial improvement in 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks compared to placebo in combination with background therapy. The trial also met 8 out of 9 secondary measures, including a compelling reduction in time to clinical worsening or death versus placebo. These findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are working diligently to submit filings from the STELLAR data to regulatory agencies and at this time, anticipate filing in the U.S. in the third quarter of this year followed by the EU.  We are advancing the broad sotatercept program, including the HYPERION, ZENITH, SOTERIA and Phase 2 CADENCE trials which are actively recruiting. Also at the ACC meeting, detailed Phase 2b results for MK-0616 were presented showing a reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels from 41.2 up to 60.9% versus placebo. Up to 90% of patients receiving MK-0616, at the highest dose studied, were able to reach their LDL-C goal. An oral PCSK9 inhibitor could provide the opportunity for broad, global access. We are initiating multiple Phase 3 studies including in secondary prevention; intermediate to high-risk primary prevention; and for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. In parallel, we will conduct a cardiovascular outcomes trial. We are making progress towards our goal of developing medicines that improve and extend the lives of patients with cardiovascular diseases and look forward to providing updates in the future.  Turning to oncology. As I have mentioned previously, a key area of focus and execution has been the development of treatments for earlier stages of cancer where there remains significant unmet need. We announced FDA acceptance of our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant, followed by adjuvant therapy in patients with resectable stage II, IIIA and IIIB non-small cell lung cancer, based on the findings to date from the KEYNOTE-671 study. The Agency has set a PDUFA action date of October 16th and detailed findings will be presented at ASCO in June. Together, with the approval of KEYTRUDA in the adjuvant setting for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, based on KEYNOTE-091, the KEYNOTE-671 study builds on the wealth of data we have generated. Relevant additional ongoing studies include KEYNOTE-867 and KEYLYNK-012. This comprehensive development program, underscores our commitment to an area where there is significant opportunity to improve patient outcomes. Importantly, it also reinforces the need for early detection through lung cancer screening.  At the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in collaboration with Moderna, we announced detailed results from KEYNOTE-942, a Phase 2b study evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with V940 also known as mRNA-4157, an individualized neoantigen therapy, for the adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV melanoma in patients with high risk of disease recurrence following complete resection. These results are the first to demonstrate improvement of recurrence-free survival over adjuvant standard of care PD-1 blockade in resected high-risk melanoma, and provide the first randomized evidence that an individualized neoantigen therapy has potential benefit. The FDA has granted this combination Breakthrough Therapy Designation and the European Medicines Agency has awarded PRIME designation for high-risk stage III and IV melanoma following complete resection. Merck and Moderna plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in adjuvant melanoma this year, and rapidly expand to additional tumor types, including non-small cell lung cancer. Together with Astellas and Seagen, we announced the FDA's accelerated approval of KEYTRUDA in combination with enfortumab vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate, for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. This accelerated approval followed Priority Review and is based on data from the KEYNOTE-869 trial. This is an important advancement as this is the first U.S. approval of a regimen combining an anti-PD-1 therapy with an antibody-drug conjugate in these patients. The approval adds to the success of our foundational work evaluating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy and provides promising evidence for combining immunotherapy with tissue targeted anticancer agents. We are well positioned to build upon this work, with a portfolio of next generation antibody drug conjugates through our collaboration with Kelun Biotech.  Planning is underway for an expansive global clinical development program and we look forward to initiating Phase 3 trials for MK-2870, our TROP-2 targeting ADC, as both monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA. We also announced that the FDA has accepted our application for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-negative locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. This filing is based on results from the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-859 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus chemotherapy demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival, reducing the risk of death by 22% compared to chemotherapy alone in these patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The agency has set a PDUFA action date of December 16th. This provides us the opportunity to expand upon our approval for patients with HER2 positive disease based on KEYNOTE-811.  We recently announced positive data from the Phase 3 NRGGY018 trial investigating KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with stage III to IV or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This is an important advancement for women with endometrial cancer building on our approvals from KEYNOTE-146, 775 and 158.  Earlier this year the American Cancer Society's 2023 annual report on cancer facts and trends, noted that survival for uterine malignancies had not improved over the past four decades due to a lack of treatment advances. We continue our work to provide better treatment options in women's cancers. And finally the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a significant and growing unmet need and therefore an area of ongoing commitment. We have gained important insights to date from our trials evaluating KEYTRUDA and Lynparza and are planning to initiate Phase 3 studies of MK-5684, a novel oral, nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP-11A1, from our collaboration with Orion, by the end of this year. Also, with AstraZeneca, we look forward to the discussion regarding the PROpel study at the upcoming oncologic drugs advisory committee meeting. We are proud of the progress we are making and look forward to hosting an investor event at ASCO in Chicago. Please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 5th where we will provide an update on our oncology strategy and development program. Turning to the progress of our infectious disease program. We are now actively enrolling multiple new Phase 3 studies for once-daily islatravir in combination with doravirine and, with Gilead, have resumed the Phase 2 study of an oral once-weekly combination treatment regimen of islatravir and Gilead's lenacapavir. We are committed to advancing the science to offer new treatment options for the treatment of HIV. On LAGEVRIO, we continue to prioritize global access during surges of COVID-19 around the world, including in Japan, where the Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare recently granted full approval for the treatment of COVID-19. We are proceeding with the evaluation of LAGEVRIO for the treatment of other viral respiratory infections and will share more as studies read out.  Finally, to our recently announced acquisition of Prometheus. Prometheus offers a strong scientific pedigree with a candidate that has shown exciting potential in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. TNF-like 1A is, a novel target, which provides the potential opportunity to transform standard of care in a disease area where current therapies are often inadequate and high unmet need remains. Prometheus' anti-TL1A antibody, PRA023, is a potential first-in-class late-stage clinical candidate with a unique dual mechanism of action including anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. PRA023's Phase 2 results in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease demonstrated strong efficacy. Further, at an interim analysis, the data in the biomarker positive sub population suggested even greater efficacy with patients more likely to achieve clinical remission. By combining Prometheus' deep understanding of inflammatory bowel disease and Merck's deep expertise in developing and implementing biomarkers, we hope to usher in a new era in Immunology where patients are matched with the right therapy based on a precision medicine approach. Prometheus' biobank of IBD specimens has yielded deep molecular insights that formed the foundation for the discovery of PRA052 and we look forward to building on that knowledge to gain further insights which will enable the identification and prioritization of additional targets.  In closing, we continue to make progress towards our goal of creating innovative medicines that will improve the outcomes for patients.  And now I turn the call back to Peter Yes. Thank you. This is Dean. I probably want to just focus really on the Phase 3s that we're advancing in melanoma and likely in others. There is a basket trial that's going through to look at the extent of the tumors that a joint sort of KEYTRUDA plus a personalized or individualized new antigen therapy will work. I can just give you a general sense. We have a little bit of a roadmap as to where immune sensitive tumors are, and we would likely prioritize those in our basket trial. I'll just answer by the competitive dynamics make us more enthusiastic to push our programs harder and faster. We will be providing data from the data that we have in a series of cancers at ASCO on June 5th. We'll have an investor, but it will also be in the ASCO, I believe, already accepted for presentation there as well. So we're very interested in that. And we're also very interested in the fact that -- as we know, the first evidence of anti-PD-1 with an antibody drug conjugates and our collaboration with Seagen has shown good effect, and we postulate that, that may be a broader impact, not just with one ADC or one indication, but more broadly, through multiple antibody drug conjugates and therefore, our interest in advancing not just the TROP2 ADC but many other ADCs that we haven't provided data as of this point. Let me just grab the question about the early-stage lung. As we've talked, the earlier stages are really important. We've already seen it in triple-negative breast cancer. We've seen it in RCC. We've seen it in melanoma. And I think the aperture of being able to do it in the lung is going to be substantial. Again, for our KEYNOTE-671, which is the first perioperative trial to announce a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS and statistically significant improvement in pathologic complete response. Those will be presented in June as well. I would also emphasize that event-free survival and overall survival are the primary endpoints of our study, and most competitors do not have OS as a primary endpoint I would also emphasize that this is also in the setting where we have perioperative, but we also have adjuvant as well. So we provide a broad treatment choice in relationship to moving forward in the earlier stage. In all earlier stage, whether it be lung, triple-negative, RCC, melanoma, I think it will be increasingly important to provide innovation that allows patients to have \"more normal\" ability to stay on these treatments long-term, there are different profiles than a metastatic patient. And so we believe that giving other routes of administration will be important. And we're advancing our subcu pembrolizumab, especially with higher round of base because that gives us an ability to do both a 3 weeks and importantly, also allows us to do a Q6 weeks because that frequency, I think, will be very important for patients. Yes. I would just focus on the pulmonary artery hypertension. I would kind of keep that a little bit distinct from other forms of lung disease, one is a primary vascular. The other one is, I could say, primary parenchyma. So I kind of separate diseases like IPF and interstitial lung disease from scleroderma as distinct from those like pulmonary arterial hypertension. You're right. We believe that sotatercept will be important. We are pushing forward with that sotatercept with STELLAR. We have ZENITH, HYPERION. There are interim analysis, but I don't actually want to sort of lay out, many of them are event-driven. The ZENITH, as you well know, is really in a more advanced situation in HYPERION is really trying to get it more in the front line. We also believe that it will potentially reshape how people think about the treatment of PAH largely people thought about vasodilation or dilation. I think this mechanism is active in signaling inhibitor with the mechanism that it has, which remodels, the tissue will reshape the field and in reshaping it, it will potentially reshape the dynamics of the vasodilatory pathways and that's why we're so excited with our inhaled SGC program, MK-5475 because we think that could be a very important combination agent with other vasodilatory mechanisms that are already approved as well as in combination with sotatercept. Thank you very much for that question. First of all, I just want to emphasize that we're in active discussions with regulatory agencies in relationship to our program as we define the Phase 3 trial. So that will put out there. The second point I would just emphasize is there is an evolving view that I think the field is coming to grips with. It's not just that LDL is an excellent biomarker. It's not just that PCSK9 is an excellent pathway. It is the fact that our 0616 interdicts exactly in the same place as some of the antibodies how 1 interprets that and how it thinks about biomarker data in that setting, I think it will be an evolving discussion with the regulatory agencies. The second question that you point out is the historic in the previous. I think you're referring to the fact that there is a view that if those studies with the antibodies had gone out a little bit longer, that they would have had a more profound impact in terms of outcomes. Those are things that we are speaking to the regulatory agencies as they think about the difference between the biomarker and the outcomes trial. But I do -- I would echo your point of view, which is one doesn't want to go too short that one risks the full maximum impact that you can have on the label. But that, as you said, needs to be balanced with whatever the IRA looks like how many years from now. So those are the balances. But your observation about the other trials is 1 that we observed as well. And my general thinking is we should try to maximize the impact that we have on patients because whatever that label is, that label will stay forever. Yes. So let me just state that it's always something that we do and everyone else does, which is this cross-trial comparison between companies, but also within companies and their own agent. What I will say is that some of the issues that have been discussed was the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm performed comparably to KEYNOTE-054 in the high-risk subgroups, which is 3C and D. and those were also included in the KEYNOTE-942. And in general, the KEYNOTE-942 had more advanced disease than those in KEYNOTE-054. So there is a way for us to sort of probabilitized given the same stage. So we're very comfortable with the pembrolizumab monotherapy arm in the trial that Merck and Moderna proceeded with. I just want to just reemphasize that this to us is an important development scientifically. This is really the first time that I can recall seeing the impact of a personalized or individualized neoantigen therapy or a personalized cancer vaccine that has that profound of a readout in a Phase 2. So we're excited to advance that to Phase 3 for melanoma and to spool up other trials in Phase 3 as we look to see how far we can push this strategy. So I would just emphasize that I think you're speaking about the Phase 2 trial. And those Phase 2 trials do provide us sort of views of how to think about the 5 Phase 3 trials that we have ongoing. I will just say that those 5 Phase 3 trials are going to be the thing that the FDA looks at. That's what they're going to look at and we're advancing those. And we're advancing them not just in metastatic situations. We have a series of them in lung. But I also just want to emphasize something that I've said previously. It relates to what people have said about KEYNOTE-671. It relates to the question about individualized neoantigen therapy, and it will relate here. When we think about IO strategies and especially IO plus IO strategies, increasingly, our eyes are turning into the earlier stages of diseases both because it's very important for patients. It's a time where we can really interdict early, but we also think that, that's an important place for us to relook on all of our assets that are IO-IO in that earlier stage. Yes. So I would just step back for just a moment. Our ability to go into earlier-stage cancers were just unlocked maybe a couple of years ago, right? And in order to do combinations, it's very important that your base molecule actually has an impact because that allows you to do contributions of components. So we're very comfortable moving our IO-IO strategies in earlier stages. We are doing it, as you said, both for pembro and TIGIT and as well as pembro plus the individualized neoantigen therapy. We're very confident that the desire of patients to be there is substantial. And our ability to recruit and do an important trial there is also important. I would also say that as you see more readouts of earlier-stage cancer for any of our assets, whether it be Lynparza, whether it be an ADC or whether it be KEYTRUDA, it will be likely that we will target multiple combinations in those spaces. Yes, I'll start with that. So as you recall, gefapixant, we had positive Phase 3 trials. We had a CRL. The CRL has nothing to do with the safety or really any major concern that would require another clinical trial. The focus was on the way that the analysis was done in the way that costs were counted. We have submitted additional analysis and will be submitting additional analysis to the FDA in the first half of this 2023 in general, I believe that the timing is that on submission of all of that data, generally speaking, the FDA then readdresses CRL in within 6 months. We have it already approved in Japan and Switzerland. And as you said, there is a renewed interest given the recent transaction, and I don't know if Caroline, would you like to answer that?"

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. At Merck, we're confronting some of the world's most challenging unmet medical needs with innovative science and differentiated solutions, and we're delivering on our key strategic priorities. The strong progress we're making across our business increases the confidence I have in our ability to achieve long-term success and create sustainable value for both patients and shareholders. We're launching important new products that solve for unmet medical needs and which have significant commercial potential. We're advancing novel clinical programs across a pipeline of diversified therapeutic areas and modalities. And we're adding to our internal research and development efforts through value-creating business development transactions. As a result, Merck is moving toward a future with a much more diversified portfolio. Our Phase 3 pipeline has nearly tripled over the past three-plus years to more than 20 unique assets. This will fuel a substantial set of new medicine and vaccine launches over the next five years. In fact, approximately equal to what we've launched over the past 10 years, and we believe the majority have blockbuster plus potential. We've improved the long-term visibility and are intensely focused on ensuring strong clinical execution across our diversified set of pipeline opportunities and future growth drivers. As always, we remain science-driven and patient-focused as we work to bring these medicines and vaccines to those who need them most. Turning to our third quarter results. Commercial execution is a top priority, and we're highly focused on delivering in the near term. The strength of our overall portfolio puts us on track to achieve strong full year growth. For the quarter, revenues increased 4% or 7% on a constant currency basis. Our results benefited from increased usage of KEYTRUDA globally, contributions from new launches, including WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE and strong growth in our Animal Health business. I'm pleased with the launch performance of WINREVAIR, which is consistent with our high expectations and remain confident in the long-term opportunity it represents for patients and for Merck. As anticipated, results also reflect a decline in GARDASIL sales year-over-year. Notably, however, we achieved strong double-digit growth for GARDASIL in almost every major region outside of China. In China, consistent with the expectations we discussed on our prior earnings call, we shipped less to our commercialization partner, Zhifei, and we expect fourth quarter shipments will be at a similar level to the third quarter. Overall channel inventories of GARDASIL have decreased, which is directionally encouraging while inventory at Zhifei remains above historical levels. We are highly focused on this market and are making progress with Zhifei to increase promotional resources and patient education efforts. We expect these efforts to translate to increased patient activation and demand. But as we've said, this will take time. Taking a step back, we're proud of the role that GARDASIL is playing in helping prevent certain HPV-related cancers. There's a wide range of long-term growth opportunities around the world due to the tremendous remaining need to protect more individuals with less than 10% of the global eligible population vaccinated and meaningful opportunities to improve vaccination completion rates, gender-neutral vaccination rates, mid-adult coverage and access in low and middle-income markets. This includes in China, where there is an attractive long-term opportunity, given the significant number of females yet to be immunized and the potential approval for males next year. We're highly focused on using our scale and strong capabilities to drive education and awareness of the benefits of HPV vaccination and to reach and protect more patients globally. As such, we remain confident in our goal of achieving greater than $11 billion of sales by 2030. Turning to our research efforts. We achieved important clinical and business development milestones this quarter. Starting with our clinical advancements in vaccines, we presented positive Phase 2b/3 results for clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants. Based on its differentiated profile and robust clinical data, we believe this opportunity is underappreciated. We're moving swiftly to make this important prevention option available in the U.S. during the '25-'26 RSV season. In pneumococcal, ACIP voted to expand vaccination recommendations for CAPVAXIVE to include adults ages 50 to 64. We're pleased to bring CAPVAXIVE's effectiveness and protecting against invasive pneumococcal disease to this new cohort of patients, and this recommendation reinforces our confidence in its blockbuster commercial potential. In oncology, it's been 10 years since KEYTRUDA's first U.S. approval, and we remain highly focused on advancing standard of care and maintaining durable leadership in oncology. At ESMO, we presented overall survival and long-term follow-up data for KEYTRUDA and data also were shared from our innovative ADCs, underscoring our commitment to building a broad and diverse oncology pipeline. In infectious diseases, we shared Phase 2 data from our collaboration with Gilead for the combination of once-weekly oral islatravir and lenacapavir for HIV treatment in treatment-experienced adults. This data represents just a portion of our broad HIV development efforts to further advance the field. In immunology, we shared positive Phase 2 maintenance data for our investigational TL1A candidate tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease that adds to positive prior clinical results. Both our HIV and immunology programs address patient populations with significant remaining unmet need despite available therapies. Our investments in these therapeutic areas reflect our belief in the opportunity to deliver additional value to patients and fortify our sustainable innovation engine for the long term. Regarding business development, we continue to leverage our scientific expertise to identify promising therapeutic targets that can further broaden and fortify our pipeline. This quarter, we acquired a novel investigational bispecific T-cell engager from Curon with potential applications in both oncology and immunology, complementing our efforts in each of these areas of high unmet need, and we closed the acquisitions of EyeBio and the Elanco aqua business. In summary, we remain highly focused on strong commercial and operational execution to enable access to our medicines and vaccines. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our pipeline that we're confident will lead to important innovations for patients and future growth drivers for our company. I want to again recognize the commitment and efforts of our team across the world. Based on our continued progress, I'm more confident in our longer term future today than I was a year ago, and I believe that Merck is even better positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain healthy, fueled by robust global demand for our innovative portfolio. This strong performance reinforces the conviction we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for continued growth. We remain confident in our ability to consistently deliver strong results in the short term while we make disciplined investments in leading-edge science, which positions us to generate lasting value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.7 billion, an increase of 4% or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business sustained its momentum with sales increasing 8%, primarily driven by oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance with sales growth of 11%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued robust global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumor types. In the earlier stage setting, the largest driver was increased use in resectable non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA's market leadership continues to grow as part of the treatment regimen in the perioperative setting, building on its existing leadership position as adjacent therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw increased uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer based on KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev continues its leadership in new patient starts outpacing platinum chemotherapy-based regimens. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer as well as continued demand from patients with metastatic disease, inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Lynparza alliance revenue grew 13%, driven by increased global demand. Lenvima alliance revenue declined 4% due to the timing of shipments last year. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $139 million, driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S. In vaccines, GARDASIL sales were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10%, driven by a decline in China. In the U.S., sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns as well as price and demand outside the U.S. sales increased by double-digits in almost every region, driven by robust demand. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 13% to $239 million, driven by ongoing launches in international markets. We are also excited by the recent launch of CAPVAXIVE, which is off to an encouraging start. In cardiovascular, the launch of WINREVAIR continues to gain momentum with global sales of $149 million. In the U.S., we have seen steady progress in adding new patients. During the quarter, approximately 1,700 new patients received a prescription, bringing the total number of new patient prescriptions to more than 3,700 since launch. Based on our experience to date, approximately 80% of those patients will receive commercial product. Given this and the approximate one month time frame to complete the steps to commence therapy more than 2,600 new commercial patients have started treatment since launch. We are seeing physicians prescribe WINREVAIR to more of their patients and new physicians prescribe the product. Through the end of September, nearly 800 physicians have written at least one prescription with most prescribers coming from either large academic centers or larger private practices. Physicians are continuing to prioritize the sickest patients who have already been receiving multiple PAH therapies. We are also making important progress in enabling access. We have achieved coverage for approximately 60% of lives, nearly doubling the amount from last quarter. Many payers have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria. Outside the U.S., initial feedback from scientific leaders has been positive following the recent EU approval. We are pleased that the first patients in Germany have received a prescription for WINREVAIR. We look forward to securing reimbursement in other European countries, which typically takes 12 months as well as launching in other international markets. In summary, we are excited with the continued progress of the launch and look forward to positively impacting more patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our Animal Health business delivered strong growth, with sales increasing 11%. Companion animal sales grew 17%, driven by uptake from new product launches, including the long-acting Bravecto injectable in certain international markets as well as price. Livestock sales grew 7%, reflecting higher demand for poultry and swine products, the inclusion of sales from the recently acquired Aqua portfolio from Elanco, which closed in mid-July and price. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.5%, an increase of 3.5 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favourable product mix. Operating expenses increased to $8.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of charges related to the acquisition of EyeBio and a promising candidate from Curon. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%, reflecting strategic investments in support of our innovative early and late phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other income was $193 million, which includes a payment of $170 million from Daiichi Sankyo related to the collaboration for our T-cell engager. Our tax rate of 21.9% includes an unfavourable impact from the EyeBio and Curon transactions. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.57. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.6 billion and $64.1 billion. This guidance range represents strong year-over-year growth of 6% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We expect operating expenses to be between $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion, which now includes the $750 million onetime charge related to the asset acquisition from Curon. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is now expected to be approximately $100 million including the benefit of the $170 million payment from Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%, which includes an unfavourable impact related to the Curon transaction. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.72 to $7.77. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.30 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $7.94 to $8.04, including the onetime charge of $750 million or $0.29 per share related to the asset acquisition from Curon and the $170 million or $0.05 per share benefit from the payment from Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $7.70 to $7.80 with a midpoint of $7.75. Therefore, our current guidance midpoint is unchanged. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains the same. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our key growth drivers and expansive pipeline of novel candidates each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of continuing to increase it over time, adding compelling science through business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchase. To conclude, as we finish the year, we are confident in the momentum of our business, underpinned by robust global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our unwavering dedication to leverage compelling science to save and improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our commitment to bring forward important innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. We have continued to execute on our strategy of diversifying in oncology and expanding into new therapeutic areas, while also investing in novel modalities and technologies. The third quarter was marked by several important clinical and regulatory milestones. I will first cover infectious diseases and oncology and conclude with updates on the broader portfolio. . As Rob noted, last week, ACIP voted to update the adult age-based pneumococcal vaccination guidelines and recommend the use of CAPVAXIVE, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for individuals 50 years and older. CAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to cover serotypes responsible for the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease and includes serotypes responsible for approximately 84% of cases of IPD in adults 50 and older based on national level CDC data from 2018 to 2022. Building on our company's proud legacy and infectious diseases, detailed findings from a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating clesrovimab, our investigation of respiratory syncytial virus preventative monoclonal antibody for the protection of infants entering their first RSV season were presented at IDWeek. Clesrovimab administered as a single dose immunization to healthy preterm and full-term infants, regardless of weight met all trial endpoints with consistent results through both 5-month and 6-month time points. The incidence of adverse events and serious AEs were comparable between treatment and placebo groups, with no treatment or RSV-related death. As shown in the summary tables in the data press release, clesrovimab immunization is being studied across mild, moderate and severe RSV disease endpoints. Importantly, clesrovimab significantly reduced the incidence of RSV, the primary endpoint and hospitalizations associated with RSV infections through 5 months by more than 84% the secondary end point. It was also observed that clesrovimab reduced RSV lower respiratory infections by more than 90% through 5 months, the tertiary endpoint. Positive results were also presented from an interim analysis in a separate Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab versus Palivizumab in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease. If approved, clesrovimab will be the first and only immunization designed to bright infants with direct rapid and durable protection for the full six months RSV season with the convenience of one dose regardless of weight or month of birth. Also at IDWeek, positive data were presented from the Phase 2 study of the combination of islatravir and lenacapavir, Gilead HIV-1 capsid inhibitor as a once-weekly oral treatment option for people living with HIV. The 48-week results build on the positive 24-week data previously presented. These findings reinforce the strength of our HIV pipeline as we evaluate multiple promising candidates in preventative and treatment settings. Next, to oncology. KEYTRUDA continues to raise the bar in treating earlier stages of disease. In the earlier-stage setting, KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive FDA approvals for nine indications and is the only one to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in four earlier-stage settings; non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as Caroline spoke to we continue to see strong patient impact. KEYTRUDA-based regimens have demonstrated positive results across 13 pivotal trials in tumor types. We look forward to building on the data in the earlier-stage setting. We recently announced positive top line results for the KEYNOTE-689 trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA as a perioperative treatment for patients newly diagnosed with Stage 3 or 4 a resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The trial met its primary endpoint of event-free survival and demonstrated an improvement in major pathological response, a key secondary endpoint. This is the first positive trial to show a statistically significant benefit of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment for newly diagnosed patients with resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 20 years. Results will be submitted to regulatory authorities and if approved would mark the tenth indication of a KEYTRUDA-based regimen for the treatment of earlier stage cancer. On the regulatory front, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on results from the KEYNOTE-483 study. This brings the number of distinct FDA-approved indications for KEYTRUDA to 41. The European Commission approved three KEYTRUDA-based regimens, which include in combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. In combination with carboplatinum and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma and in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014 Stage 3 to 4A locally advanced cervical cancer in adults who have not received prior definitive therapy based on KEYNOTE-868. KEYTRUDA was also approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health for three indications. In combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. For patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-052 as well as in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment then continued as monotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer based on findings from KEYNOTE-671. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, three presentations for KEYTRUDA were showcased during presidential symposium sessions. These include overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial and high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. Overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-A18 trial in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer and 10-year follow-up overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-006 trial showing the long-term benefit over Ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. And finally in oncology, we continue to advance our increasingly diverse pipeline, including our efforts to evaluate the potential of new combination regimens to improve patient outcomes. Earlier this month, we announced a clinical development collaboration with Exelixis for their investigation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Zanzalintinib, which will be evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and with WELIREG for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. In collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, we initiated IDeate-Lung02, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Ifinatamab, Deruxtecan, a B7-H3 directed antibody drug conjugate for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer. We also expanded our agreement to evaluate the combination of IDXD with MK-6070, an investigation of delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager. Evidence from clinical studies for each candidate provides strong rationale for evaluating this combination regimen. Next, to our broader portfolio. As Caroline mentioned, we were pleased to receive approval from the European Commission for WINREVAIR, expanding the reach of this treatment option, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for patients suffering for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In immunology, 50-week efficacy and safety data for tulisokibart, our investigational humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor like cytokine 1A from the Phase 2 ARTEMIS-UC and APOLLO-CD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, were presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Congress. The results reinforce the potential of tulisokibart to help patients achieve long-term clinical remission. The Phase 3 trials continue to actively enroll patients. Finally, in ophthalmology, soon after completing our acquisition of EyeBio, we initiated the Phase 2b/3 BRUNELLO trial for MK-3000 an investigational tetravalent, trispecific antibody that acts as an agonist of the winglet related integration site signaling pathway being evaluated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. We are executing on our one pipeline approach, augmenting and complementing our internal programs through business development. Recently, we completed the acquisition of CN201, a novel CD3, CD19 T-cell engager, now known as MK-1045 from Curon Biopharmaceutical. MK-1045 has shown to significantly deplete B-cell levels with potential applications in B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As with our previous acquisitions, we plan to seamlessly advance clinical development with rigor and speed. In closing, during the quarter, we saw a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline advancements including regulatory milestones and data readouts. We continue to make progress across therapeutic areas, and I look forward to providing further updates on our programs in 2025. And now I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Shirley, we're now ready for Q&A. If the analysts today could limit themselves to one question, it would be appreciated so we can get as many analysts on the call as possible. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nTrung Huynh: Thanks for taking my question. Just on GARDASIL, given the inventory levels remain elevated, you've noted this declining demand. How should we think about dynamics as we head into 2025, given that increase in promotional activity, but that's balanced by the inventory work down will take time? Or do you have any color on when we'll see an inflection to that returning growth?\nRob Davis: Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're very focused on GARDASIL in China, but maybe just to step back for a second. And we continue to be very proud of the contribution that GARDASIL is making for patients and people around the world to really address and hopefully eliminate long-term cervical cancer as well as other HPV-related cancers. So that important work will continue -- and importantly, as we commented in our prepared remarks, while China did decline, and I'll speak to China in a second. Overall, we saw strong double-digit growth in really nearly every other region around the world, which is showing the progress we're making and which is why we continue to have such confidence in the long-term potential for this. But as it relates to China specifically, and as we think about 2025, I don't want to give specific guidance because obviously, we're still working through our 2025 plan. But what I would say is we do expect to continue to see a decline in shipments into China into 2025. And as we had highlighted before, this is happening a little bit earlier than we originally expected, but we had always expected that over time, as we work through the bolus, we would see the female opportunity decline and then hopefully seeing growth come with bringing the mail opportunity, which we would expect to see with approval, assuming it comes next year. So that's how we see it progressing. So as we think about 2025, we see China really in the $2 billion to $3 billion range as far as an opportunity for 2025 and for the next several years with the opportunity in males really being the growth driver. And at that level, we would expect for overall Merck that you're going to continue to see based on the portfolio we have solid growth. So I think that's just important to kind of frame where we're seeing things. But understanding, we're focused on this. We're bringing our efforts to drive demand and we're going to make progress. We are making progress, but it's going to take some time.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Trung. Next question please, Shirley. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Edward [ph] on for Vamil from Guggenheim. Just on WINREVIR, what are you seeing in terms of safety since it's been rolled out commercially. Any sense of how many patients are on the low dose versus the high dose? And then, any estimate of what percent of patients need to have their dose reduced or stopped due to the safety issues?\nRob Davis: Yes. I'll maybe let Dean start and then I can jump in.\nDean Li: From the safety issue, we haven't had any profound or important signals at all in relationship to the patients that we've been serving. So that has not been an issue to date in the patients that have gotten WINREVAIR, but more broadly.\nRob Davis: Yes. So just to give you a sense of what we're seeing in the marketplace as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing the sickest patients being predominantly about 80% of the patients we have today. So those would be people on triple therapy. And as we're looking at the kits being used, we're still predominantly seeing use of single vials, not double vials as we're still bringing a lot of people onto therapy, remember that when a patient starts therapy, they start on a single vial and then they would transition either to maintaining on single or going to double depending on their weight over time. So we expect to see, as we saw with STELLAR that you would end up with about two-third of patients would be on the single vial and about one-third of patients on the double vial right now, that's a little bit more skewed towards single, but we expect it still to get there over time. And importantly, on your broader question, Dean gave one sense about where we see safety. I think the best real-world statement around safety we're seeing very strong adherence and really seeing less discontinuations than we expected. So the anecdotal information we're getting from the marketplace as far as the rural world experience, I would say, as said that safety is not an issue.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Shirley, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. You may ask your question.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you about your outlook for 2025? What are the major puts and takes are? And when do you plan to get that guidance? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. I'll turn it over to Caroline for that.\nCaroline Litchfield: So Louise, we plan to give our guidance with the fourth quarter earnings as we ordinarily do. But if I give you a sense of the overall pushes and pulls. If I start with 2024, it's been a really strong year for our company. As we've noted, we expect to deliver 6% to 7% growth, while we're investing in and really driving our pipeline and have delivered strong underlying operating margin improvement. As we look to 2025, we expect solid growth for our business. And the key opportunities that we have is the continued impact for KEYTRUDA especially in earlier-stage cancers but the tumor types we would call out would be early stage non-small cell lung cancer. We've got great opportunity in women's cancers, including early Stage 2 negative breast but also endometrial and cervical cancer. And of course, bladder cancer is a real opportunity for growth. We are confident where we are with were and the opportunities there to continue to see strong performance and the impact for patients. And of course, we have the recent and upcoming launches that includes WINREVAIR, where we have high expectations for growth. It includes CAPVAXIVE, where we expect to get a majority share over time, and it also includes the opportunity for the launch of clesrovimab in RSV ahead of the '25-'26 season. And as we noted, Animal Health is a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue into next year. We have a few headwinds. One is the expiration of our agreement with J&J for the immunology products, REMICADE and SIMPONI. And as Rob noted, we do expect sales of GARDASIL in China to decline in 2025 compared with 2024. However, all of that said, we're very confident in the opportunity to drive solid growth for our business in '25, while we invest fully behind our expansive pipeline investing the commercial activities to ensure excellence in the marketplace and expect to deliver operating margin expansion.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Louise. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may ask your question.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. The capital allocation opportunity is something that you have been very consistent about providing us updates given some of the push and pulls in the business, in particular vulnerability with GARDASIL, I think you have capacity and you have also mentioned interest in certain areas, I would note with obesity. Can you update us on where you are with your appetite therapeutic area, anything that would give us insight into your ability to use that as a lever to help perhaps offset some of this uncertainty tied to GARDASIL?\nRob Davis: Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, I feel very good about the business development we've done, including some of the transactions that Dean just highlighted in the prepared remarks, and we're going to continue to look to do more. So while we feel good about where we are. And actually, as I made a comment in the prepared remarks, we have more Phase 3 assets now than we had was more than tripled that from where we were 3 years ago and with more than 20. So we have a lot there, but we need to add more. And we're looking across all therapeutic areas. Our approach remains where it's always been, which is we start with the science, and where we see a scientific opportunity that addresses an unmet need and where we think Merck can strategically play, if we see that aligned with value, we will act as it relates to obesity, our goal and strategy there continues to be focusing on the second and third generation opportunities in that space. We've talked in the past, thinking more of a focus on oral opportunities and those that can be in combination focused on outcomes that go beyond just obesity but to actually medical outcomes. So we continue to look but we're going to be disciplined. And if we don't see something where we think it makes sense from a value perspective and a strategy, we won't move. Beyond that, I would say, you should continue to see us look in areas of oncology immunology and broader cardio metabolic, all the places where we're playing today are areas where we continue to look for opportunities down the road. From a capacity perspective, just to be clear, we continue to think we have capacity, frankly, to do pretty much anything of any size. But our focus area continues to be mainly in that $1 billion to $15 billion range.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Daina Graybosch with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nDaina Graybosch: Yes. Can you talk a little bit more about the pneumococcal opportunity? What do you think is the incremental market size from the expansion down to age 50? And is there anything you're looking for in the MMWR language when they publish that recommendation that would drive more or less share to CAPVAXIVE versus the competitors?\nRob Davis: Yes. Maybe, Dean, do you want to start, and we can jump in?\nDean Li: Yes. I mean, I think it was interesting to watch the ACIP. They're balancing how to make the best recommendations, and we should just remember, we have a 21-valent vaccine that gives 85% adult protection that was very clear, and there is a competitor who has a 20-valent that has a 54% adult protection. And I think that was very clear at the ACIP. And I would just remind myself that previously when they thought about doing the 50 to 64, just with the 20-valent, there was a decision not to proceed. And I really do think the health economic data and the data that we show for the 21-valent given it's 85% versus 54% is what drove them to finally move and address a really important need, which is the health equity issues in relationship to a pneumococcal vaccination by lowering it to 50 to 64 and lowering it for everyone. But in terms of the dynamics in the market.\nCaroline Litchfield: So, in terms of the commercial opportunity we have, given the strength of the data that Dean has just shared, we feel very confident in our opportunity. And to remind, in terms of the number of patients in the United States, there's around 120 million people over the age of 50, 60 million of those are in the 50 to 64 age group, which now given the ACIP recommendation provides a tremendous opportunity for us to activate that patient cohort to go and get this vaccine as well as the group that sit above the age of 65 given the strength of our data. So, we are ready. We have supply, and we're looking forward to ensuring that we can protect as many people as possible.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Daina. Next question please, Shirley.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much. Just another one on GARDASIL. Rob, I believe you said kind of $2 billion to $3 billion per year opportunity for China over the next few years. Just a couple of quick ones there. First, what does that compare to where China is going to shake out for Merck this year? And is that $2 billion to $3 billion number what was reflected in the $11 billion longer-term target? Thanks so much.\nRob Davis: Yes. So, to give you just a sense of where we are, and we don't normally give product level guidance or specifics on a quarterly basis. But given the importance and focus on GARDASIL, just to give you a sense of where we were with China, GARDASIL in the third quarter. It's about approximately $500 million in the third quarter. And as we said, we would expect to ship about the same amount in the fourth quarter. So you should expect that the fourth quarter itself would also be in that $500 million range. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where we are. So as you look forward to 2025, obviously, as we think in 2025 and over the next several years, if you're running in that $2 billion to $3 billion range, that's why we made the comment that with that and given the other opportunities we see around the world, we remain confident in our ability to get to the $11 billion by 2030. So we are contemplating that $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years in China as the contribution that it would make to get us to where we need, understanding also that long term, we do expect to be able to have the potential for growth driven by the male opportunity in China and then obviously continuing to drive more broadly around the rest of the world.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Chris. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just one question and one clarification. Just on the GARDASIL side, Rob, that's the $2 billion to $3 billion includes the males or it does not include the males, sorry I was a little unclear based on the last response. And then obviously, next-gen IO remains a big focus for both Merck and the industry, I know, Dean, you talked a lot about some of the efforts Merck has made on this front. Would just be curious to get your perspective on the PD-1, PD-L1 VEGF bispecifics. Obviously, there's some data emerging out of China there. Just any thoughts on that data and where that might fit from a competitive landscape perspective or if that's a target Merck has considered at all?\nRob Davis: Yes. So, I'll take the first part of that question, Terence. So the answer is yes. The $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years does include male, but we have the opportunity as you look longer term to drive growth with that opportunity. That was really the point we were trying to make.\nDean Li: In relation to your question in relationship to the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, it is an important axis. I just -- there's been a lot of data in that. It's not just the most recent data. Merck has made a substantial investment in that pathway our collaborations with Eisai and Exelixis is along that pathway. It's PD-1, in this case, with the VEGF RTK inhibitors. Other companies have taken their PD-L1 and added to, for example, Avastin, and I would just emphasize, our interest in HIF-2 alpha is also related to vascular endothelial growth factor. In relationship to the specific question about Summit, that deep expertise that has developed in that VEGF. I think it's really important for all of us to watch carefully, and we are watching carefully the ability to turn PFS into OS. The other issue is that in China, the health system is a little bit different as to how they treat individuals, but also the patients here are also different in terms of their responsiveness to VEGF. I would also emphasize that the experiment that was done in China is an experiment that we would be unable to do, for example, in the United States, we would not be able to compare new combo against KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the PD-L1 through 49% PD-L1 that's something we would not be able to do because in that situation, the comparator is not monotherapy, but it's KEYNOTE-189. But broadly speaking, combos will be important, combos to deepen it to go earlier stage will be important. I think vascular endothelial growth factor pathways are important. IT will be import, RAS will be import, ADCs will be important and all of those readouts will come some before 2028, some around 2028 and some will happen after 2028.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Terence. Next question please, Shirley.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate all the GARDASIL color. Maybe on WINREVAIR, can you comment on the impact of stocking in the quarter? And I'm trying to also kind of square Rob, some of your comments around sort of the efforts to work through the sickest patients, kind of maybe help frame for us kind of how far you're along sort of that initial bolus of patients, those later line patients within the STELLAR label? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: So Carter, in the quarter, over 80% of the revenue is to support demand. And so a very small level of inventory build and we'd expect inventory dollars to build over time, given the growth that we expect in the product. In terms of the patients that are being prescribed the product, as Rob noted, a large portion, it's actually about 80% of the patients are on background triple therapy or in combination with the prostacyclin. So we're making really good progress in that segment. At the same time, a large number of the physicians have prescribed WINREVAIR now to patients that are not on a prostacyclin background therapy which gives us confidence for the ability to move to the patients who are more dual therapy over time. And we remain confident in the opportunity in line with our high expectations here to benefit patients and to drive significant commercial benefit for our company.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Carter. Next question please, Shirley.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. You may ask your question.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have -- I wanted to focus on GARDASIL just a little more. That was a very helpful commentary, Rob, you mentioned 500 million in sales in 3Q and 4Q to China, which obviously is 2 billion run rate. My question is, was that shipping to demand because if so, what that means is inventory sitting at your pay is still something that would need to be worked down in 2025 as well as possible 9-valent generic entry -- sorry, 9-valent local competition entry in 2025 as well. How do you factor those 2 dynamics into thinking about the 2025 number of 2 billion to 3 billion in China?\nRob Davis: Yes. So if you look at what's happening in the overall marketplace and just to give you a sense, from an inventory perspective, maybe starting there. If you look at overall inventory levels in China, they did come down. And that's taking into account and this is for GARDASIL. GARDASIL and Zhifei, which frankly remains high and grew slightly but that was more than offset by reductions in the CDCs and the points of vaccination. So that's a good sign that we're seeing overall inventories coming down, which also would point to the fact that as we're looking at demand, which we're seeing stabilize, we think we're at a position now whereas we're starting to talk about what we're shipping. Our expectation is we are shipping below demand. So we have been working very constructively with Zhifei to think about this, both is what we're doing in this year is, frankly, as well as we're continuing to have constructive dialogue around 2025. Our intention would be to balance the need to get product into the marketplace to meet the demand at the same time, allowing for Zhifei to bring down their inventories over time. So we're very thoughtful on how we're thinking about it, and we've done that, taking into account our expectations of both the female competitive launch that could come next year, but also the opportunity that a male approval early next year could allow us to have. So all of those factors are in as we think about that $2 billion to $3 billion number.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Umer. Perhaps two more questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please ask your question.\nSteve Scala: Thank you very much. I mean, all things considered, is it still possible to see global GARDASIL growth in 2025. And Rob, you noted at the start that recovery in China will take time. But it sounds like you have good visibility now because you're giving this $2 billion to $3 billion guidance for GARDASIL in China. So I'm unclear what it is that we're waiting for.\nRob Davis: Well, what we're talking about taking time is basically to work down the inventory and to then build demand over time so that we can continue to drive that market. What we're giving you is kind of what we see as the baseline of China. Our hope is that we'll do better. And we're going to put the work in to do better and to continue to drive long term. I think that what I'm trying to make sure everyone hears is this isn't going to be solved next quarter. It's going to take us through probably 2025, but we're thoughtful on how we're doing it. We're working with Zhifei in a constructive manner to do it. So those are the elements are going to take time because we need to build the demand. We know the opportunity is there with 120 million females still out there to go after and with potentially 200 million males with the male opportunity. We have to activate that demand to make sure we can drive that business. So that's really what we're focusing on. As far as it relates to GARDASIL for 2025, I don't think we really want to get into giving product line guidance right now. We were very specific to China because of the concerns that were there. And I wanted to make sure, that we see solid overall growth for Merck because that's important to have context. But beyond that, we normally wouldn't be giving guidance at this point in time.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Steve. Last question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And that comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.\nMohit Bansal: Great, thank you very much for taking my question. My question is regarding V940 in lung cancer. I see that you have started Phase 3 trial. Could you please help us understand what kind of data you have seen in earlier stages, which makes you move into Phase 3, I don't think we have seen a lot of data from our side here.\nDean Li: Yes. So this is Dean. I would just emphasize, and I was trying to sort of lay the foundation during the prepared remarks. I would just recognize that in earlier stage, we have 9 approvals and 4 with OS, that basis allows us to drive curative setting combos in a way that is advantageous for the patient and also often uniquely ability for us. The specific study that you're, I think, referring to is the announcement with our partners, Moderna, of going in lung cancer. Specifically, that one is built around KEYNOTE-671, which has an OS benefit and is approved. But the interesting thing is in the sort of neoadjuvant or perioperative followed by surgery, there becomes a situation where we can discern who has a pathological complete response and who doesn't have a pathological complete response. And that patient population that does not have a pathological complete response there is the need and our ability to provide other combinations in that space, and that is where we're driving the INT in that situation in lung cancer.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you all for your good questions today. And as always, we're available for follow-ups. Please reach out when you want. Take care. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. We have continued to execute on our strategy of diversifying in oncology and expanding into new therapeutic areas, while also investing in novel modalities and technologies. The third quarter was marked by several important clinical and regulatory milestones. I will first cover infectious diseases and oncology and conclude with updates on the broader portfolio. . As Rob noted, last week, ACIP voted to update the adult age-based pneumococcal vaccination guidelines and recommend the use of CAPVAXIVE, our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for individuals 50 years and older. CAPVAXIVE is specifically designed to cover serotypes responsible for the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease and includes serotypes responsible for approximately 84% of cases of IPD in adults 50 and older based on national level CDC data from 2018 to 2022. Building on our company's proud legacy and infectious diseases, detailed findings from a pivotal Phase 2b/3 clinical trial evaluating clesrovimab, our investigation of respiratory syncytial virus preventative monoclonal antibody for the protection of infants entering their first RSV season were presented at IDWeek. Clesrovimab administered as a single dose immunization to healthy preterm and full-term infants, regardless of weight met all trial endpoints with consistent results through both 5-month and 6-month time points. The incidence of adverse events and serious AEs were comparable between treatment and placebo groups, with no treatment or RSV-related death. As shown in the summary tables in the data press release, clesrovimab immunization is being studied across mild, moderate and severe RSV disease endpoints. Importantly, clesrovimab significantly reduced the incidence of RSV, the primary endpoint and hospitalizations associated with RSV infections through 5 months by more than 84% the secondary end point. It was also observed that clesrovimab reduced RSV lower respiratory infections by more than 90% through 5 months, the tertiary endpoint. Positive results were also presented from an interim analysis in a separate Phase 3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of clesrovimab versus Palivizumab in infants and children at increased risk for severe RSV disease. If approved, clesrovimab will be the first and only immunization designed to bright infants with direct rapid and durable protection for the full six months RSV season with the convenience of one dose regardless of weight or month of birth. Also at IDWeek, positive data were presented from the Phase 2 study of the combination of islatravir and lenacapavir, Gilead HIV-1 capsid inhibitor as a once-weekly oral treatment option for people living with HIV. The 48-week results build on the positive 24-week data previously presented. These findings reinforce the strength of our HIV pipeline as we evaluate multiple promising candidates in preventative and treatment settings. Next, to oncology. KEYTRUDA continues to raise the bar in treating earlier stages of disease. In the earlier-stage setting, KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive FDA approvals for nine indications and is the only one to demonstrate a significant overall survival benefit in four earlier-stage settings; non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. And as Caroline spoke to we continue to see strong patient impact. KEYTRUDA-based regimens have demonstrated positive results across 13 pivotal trials in tumor types. We look forward to building on the data in the earlier-stage setting. We recently announced positive top line results for the KEYNOTE-689 trial, evaluating KEYTRUDA as a perioperative treatment for patients newly diagnosed with Stage 3 or 4 a resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The trial met its primary endpoint of event-free survival and demonstrated an improvement in major pathological response, a key secondary endpoint. This is the first positive trial to show a statistically significant benefit of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant anti-PD-1 treatment for newly diagnosed patients with resected locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 20 years. Results will be submitted to regulatory authorities and if approved would mark the tenth indication of a KEYTRUDA-based regimen for the treatment of earlier stage cancer. On the regulatory front, we received FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on results from the KEYNOTE-483 study. This brings the number of distinct FDA-approved indications for KEYTRUDA to 41. The European Commission approved three KEYTRUDA-based regimens, which include in combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. In combination with carboplatinum and paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma and in combination with chemo radiotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014 Stage 3 to 4A locally advanced cervical cancer in adults who have not received prior definitive therapy based on KEYNOTE-868. KEYTRUDA was also approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health for three indications. In combination with Pfizer's Padcev and Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate, for the first-line treatment of adult patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma based on the KEYNOTE-A39 study. For patients with radically unresectable urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy based on KEYNOTE-052 as well as in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment then continued as monotherapy as an adjuvant therapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer based on findings from KEYNOTE-671. At the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress, three presentations for KEYTRUDA were showcased during presidential symposium sessions. These include overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-522 trial and high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer. Overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-A18 trial in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer and 10-year follow-up overall survival data from the KEYNOTE-006 trial showing the long-term benefit over Ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. And finally in oncology, we continue to advance our increasingly diverse pipeline, including our efforts to evaluate the potential of new combination regimens to improve patient outcomes. Earlier this month, we announced a clinical development collaboration with Exelixis for their investigation oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Zanzalintinib, which will be evaluated in combination with KEYTRUDA for the treatment of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and with WELIREG for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. In collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, we initiated IDeate-Lung02, a Phase 3 trial evaluating Ifinatamab, Deruxtecan, a B7-H3 directed antibody drug conjugate for the treatment of patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer. We also expanded our agreement to evaluate the combination of IDXD with MK-6070, an investigation of delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager. Evidence from clinical studies for each candidate provides strong rationale for evaluating this combination regimen. Next, to our broader portfolio. As Caroline mentioned, we were pleased to receive approval from the European Commission for WINREVAIR, expanding the reach of this treatment option, which we believe has the potential to transform the treatment journey for patients suffering for pulmonary arterial hypertension. In immunology, 50-week efficacy and safety data for tulisokibart, our investigational humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor like cytokine 1A from the Phase 2 ARTEMIS-UC and APOLLO-CD studies in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, were presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Congress. The results reinforce the potential of tulisokibart to help patients achieve long-term clinical remission. The Phase 3 trials continue to actively enroll patients. Finally, in ophthalmology, soon after completing our acquisition of EyeBio, we initiated the Phase 2b/3 BRUNELLO trial for MK-3000 an investigational tetravalent, trispecific antibody that acts as an agonist of the winglet related integration site signaling pathway being evaluated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema. We are executing on our one pipeline approach, augmenting and complementing our internal programs through business development. Recently, we completed the acquisition of CN201, a novel CD3, CD19 T-cell engager, now known as MK-1045 from Curon Biopharmaceutical. MK-1045 has shown to significantly deplete B-cell levels with potential applications in B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases. As with our previous acquisitions, we plan to seamlessly advance clinical development with rigor and speed. In closing, during the quarter, we saw a regular cadence of late-phase pipeline advancements including regulatory milestones and data readouts. We continue to make progress across therapeutic areas, and I look forward to providing further updates on our programs in 2025. And now I turn the call back to Peter. From the safety issue, we haven't had any profound or important signals at all in relationship to the patients that we've been serving. So that has not been an issue to date in the patients that have gotten WINREVAIR, but more broadly. Yes. I mean, I think it was interesting to watch the ACIP. They're balancing how to make the best recommendations, and we should just remember, we have a 21-valent vaccine that gives 85% adult protection that was very clear, and there is a competitor who has a 20-valent that has a 54% adult protection. And I think that was very clear at the ACIP. And I would just remind myself that previously when they thought about doing the 50 to 64, just with the 20-valent, there was a decision not to proceed. And I really do think the health economic data and the data that we show for the 21-valent given it's 85% versus 54% is what drove them to finally move and address a really important need, which is the health equity issues in relationship to a pneumococcal vaccination by lowering it to 50 to 64 and lowering it for everyone. But in terms of the dynamics in the market. In relation to your question in relationship to the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, it is an important axis. I just -- there's been a lot of data in that. It's not just the most recent data. Merck has made a substantial investment in that pathway our collaborations with Eisai and Exelixis is along that pathway. It's PD-1, in this case, with the VEGF RTK inhibitors. Other companies have taken their PD-L1 and added to, for example, Avastin, and I would just emphasize, our interest in HIF-2 alpha is also related to vascular endothelial growth factor. In relationship to the specific question about Summit, that deep expertise that has developed in that VEGF. I think it's really important for all of us to watch carefully, and we are watching carefully the ability to turn PFS into OS. The other issue is that in China, the health system is a little bit different as to how they treat individuals, but also the patients here are also different in terms of their responsiveness to VEGF. I would also emphasize that the experiment that was done in China is an experiment that we would be unable to do, for example, in the United States, we would not be able to compare new combo against KEYTRUDA monotherapy in the PD-L1 through 49% PD-L1 that's something we would not be able to do because in that situation, the comparator is not monotherapy, but it's KEYNOTE-189. But broadly speaking, combos will be important, combos to deepen it to go earlier stage will be important. I think vascular endothelial growth factor pathways are important. IT will be import, RAS will be import, ADCs will be important and all of those readouts will come some before 2028, some around 2028 and some will happen after 2028. Yes. So this is Dean. I would just emphasize, and I was trying to sort of lay the foundation during the prepared remarks. I would just recognize that in earlier stage, we have 9 approvals and 4 with OS, that basis allows us to drive curative setting combos in a way that is advantageous for the patient and also often uniquely ability for us. The specific study that you're, I think, referring to is the announcement with our partners, Moderna, of going in lung cancer. Specifically, that one is built around KEYNOTE-671, which has an OS benefit and is approved. But the interesting thing is in the sort of neoadjuvant or perioperative followed by surgery, there becomes a situation where we can discern who has a pathological complete response and who doesn't have a pathological complete response. And that patient population that does not have a pathological complete response there is the need and our ability to provide other combinations in that space, and that is where we're driving the INT in that situation in lung cancer."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter. The fundamentals of our business remain healthy, fueled by robust global demand for our innovative portfolio. This strong performance reinforces the conviction we have in our science-led strategy and in our outlook for continued growth. We remain confident in our ability to consistently deliver strong results in the short term while we make disciplined investments in leading-edge science, which positions us to generate lasting value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our third quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.7 billion, an increase of 4% or 7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business sustained its momentum with sales increasing 8%, primarily driven by oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered strong performance with sales growth of 11%. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion. Global growth was driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued robust global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S. KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumor types. In the earlier stage setting, the largest driver was increased use in resectable non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA's market leadership continues to grow as part of the treatment regimen in the perioperative setting, building on its existing leadership position as adjacent therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw increased uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer based on KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev continues its leadership in new patient starts outpacing platinum chemotherapy-based regimens. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer as well as continued demand from patients with metastatic disease, inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Lynparza alliance revenue grew 13%, driven by increased global demand. Lenvima alliance revenue declined 4% due to the timing of shipments last year. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $139 million, driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma in the U.S. In vaccines, GARDASIL sales were $2.3 billion, a decrease of 10%, driven by a decline in China. In the U.S., sales benefited from CDC purchasing patterns as well as price and demand outside the U.S. sales increased by double-digits in almost every region, driven by robust demand. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 13% to $239 million, driven by ongoing launches in international markets. We are also excited by the recent launch of CAPVAXIVE, which is off to an encouraging start. In cardiovascular, the launch of WINREVAIR continues to gain momentum with global sales of $149 million. In the U.S., we have seen steady progress in adding new patients. During the quarter, approximately 1,700 new patients received a prescription, bringing the total number of new patient prescriptions to more than 3,700 since launch. Based on our experience to date, approximately 80% of those patients will receive commercial product. Given this and the approximate one month time frame to complete the steps to commence therapy more than 2,600 new commercial patients have started treatment since launch. We are seeing physicians prescribe WINREVAIR to more of their patients and new physicians prescribe the product. Through the end of September, nearly 800 physicians have written at least one prescription with most prescribers coming from either large academic centers or larger private practices. Physicians are continuing to prioritize the sickest patients who have already been receiving multiple PAH therapies. We are also making important progress in enabling access. We have achieved coverage for approximately 60% of lives, nearly doubling the amount from last quarter. Many payers have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria. Outside the U.S., initial feedback from scientific leaders has been positive following the recent EU approval. We are pleased that the first patients in Germany have received a prescription for WINREVAIR. We look forward to securing reimbursement in other European countries, which typically takes 12 months as well as launching in other international markets. In summary, we are excited with the continued progress of the launch and look forward to positively impacting more patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our Animal Health business delivered strong growth, with sales increasing 11%. Companion animal sales grew 17%, driven by uptake from new product launches, including the long-acting Bravecto injectable in certain international markets as well as price. Livestock sales grew 7%, reflecting higher demand for poultry and swine products, the inclusion of sales from the recently acquired Aqua portfolio from Elanco, which closed in mid-July and price. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.5%, an increase of 3.5 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favourable product mix. Operating expenses increased to $8.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of charges related to the acquisition of EyeBio and a promising candidate from Curon. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 9%, reflecting strategic investments in support of our innovative early and late phase pipeline and key growth drivers. Other income was $193 million, which includes a payment of $170 million from Daiichi Sankyo related to the collaboration for our T-cell engager. Our tax rate of 21.9% includes an unfavourable impact from the EyeBio and Curon transactions. Taken together, earnings per share were $1.57. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.6 billion and $64.1 billion. This guidance range represents strong year-over-year growth of 6% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-October rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We expect operating expenses to be between $27.8 billion and $28.3 billion, which now includes the $750 million onetime charge related to the asset acquisition from Curon. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is now expected to be approximately $100 million including the benefit of the $170 million payment from Daiichi. Our full year tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%, which includes an unfavourable impact related to the Curon transaction. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.72 to $7.77. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.30 using mid-October rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $7.94 to $8.04, including the onetime charge of $750 million or $0.29 per share related to the asset acquisition from Curon and the $170 million or $0.05 per share benefit from the payment from Daiichi, our prior guidance range would have been $7.70 to $7.80 with a midpoint of $7.75. Therefore, our current guidance midpoint is unchanged. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains the same. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our key growth drivers and expansive pipeline of novel candidates each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend with the goal of continuing to increase it over time, adding compelling science through business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchase. To conclude, as we finish the year, we are confident in the momentum of our business, underpinned by robust global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines. Our unwavering dedication to leverage compelling science to save and improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our commitment to bring forward important innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. So Louise, we plan to give our guidance with the fourth quarter earnings as we ordinarily do. But if I give you a sense of the overall pushes and pulls. If I start with 2024, it's been a really strong year for our company. As we've noted, we expect to deliver 6% to 7% growth, while we're investing in and really driving our pipeline and have delivered strong underlying operating margin improvement. As we look to 2025, we expect solid growth for our business. And the key opportunities that we have is the continued impact for KEYTRUDA especially in earlier-stage cancers but the tumor types we would call out would be early stage non-small cell lung cancer. We've got great opportunity in women's cancers, including early Stage 2 negative breast but also endometrial and cervical cancer. And of course, bladder cancer is a real opportunity for growth. We are confident where we are with were and the opportunities there to continue to see strong performance and the impact for patients. And of course, we have the recent and upcoming launches that includes WINREVAIR, where we have high expectations for growth. It includes CAPVAXIVE, where we expect to get a majority share over time, and it also includes the opportunity for the launch of clesrovimab in RSV ahead of the '25-'26 season. And as we noted, Animal Health is a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue into next year. We have a few headwinds. One is the expiration of our agreement with J&J for the immunology products, REMICADE and SIMPONI. And as Rob noted, we do expect sales of GARDASIL in China to decline in 2025 compared with 2024. However, all of that said, we're very confident in the opportunity to drive solid growth for our business in '25, while we invest fully behind our expansive pipeline investing the commercial activities to ensure excellence in the marketplace and expect to deliver operating margin expansion. So, in terms of the commercial opportunity we have, given the strength of the data that Dean has just shared, we feel very confident in our opportunity. And to remind, in terms of the number of patients in the United States, there's around 120 million people over the age of 50, 60 million of those are in the 50 to 64 age group, which now given the ACIP recommendation provides a tremendous opportunity for us to activate that patient cohort to go and get this vaccine as well as the group that sit above the age of 65 given the strength of our data. So, we are ready. We have supply, and we're looking forward to ensuring that we can protect as many people as possible. So Carter, in the quarter, over 80% of the revenue is to support demand. And so a very small level of inventory build and we'd expect inventory dollars to build over time, given the growth that we expect in the product. In terms of the patients that are being prescribed the product, as Rob noted, a large portion, it's actually about 80% of the patients are on background triple therapy or in combination with the prostacyclin. So we're making really good progress in that segment. At the same time, a large number of the physicians have prescribed WINREVAIR now to patients that are not on a prostacyclin background therapy which gives us confidence for the ability to move to the patients who are more dual therapy over time. And we remain confident in the opportunity in line with our high expectations here to benefit patients and to drive significant commercial benefit for our company."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. At Merck, we're confronting some of the world's most challenging unmet medical needs with innovative science and differentiated solutions, and we're delivering on our key strategic priorities. The strong progress we're making across our business increases the confidence I have in our ability to achieve long-term success and create sustainable value for both patients and shareholders. We're launching important new products that solve for unmet medical needs and which have significant commercial potential. We're advancing novel clinical programs across a pipeline of diversified therapeutic areas and modalities. And we're adding to our internal research and development efforts through value-creating business development transactions. As a result, Merck is moving toward a future with a much more diversified portfolio. Our Phase 3 pipeline has nearly tripled over the past three-plus years to more than 20 unique assets. This will fuel a substantial set of new medicine and vaccine launches over the next five years. In fact, approximately equal to what we've launched over the past 10 years, and we believe the majority have blockbuster plus potential. We've improved the long-term visibility and are intensely focused on ensuring strong clinical execution across our diversified set of pipeline opportunities and future growth drivers. As always, we remain science-driven and patient-focused as we work to bring these medicines and vaccines to those who need them most. Turning to our third quarter results. Commercial execution is a top priority, and we're highly focused on delivering in the near term. The strength of our overall portfolio puts us on track to achieve strong full year growth. For the quarter, revenues increased 4% or 7% on a constant currency basis. Our results benefited from increased usage of KEYTRUDA globally, contributions from new launches, including WINREVAIR and CAPVAXIVE and strong growth in our Animal Health business. I'm pleased with the launch performance of WINREVAIR, which is consistent with our high expectations and remain confident in the long-term opportunity it represents for patients and for Merck. As anticipated, results also reflect a decline in GARDASIL sales year-over-year. Notably, however, we achieved strong double-digit growth for GARDASIL in almost every major region outside of China. In China, consistent with the expectations we discussed on our prior earnings call, we shipped less to our commercialization partner, Zhifei, and we expect fourth quarter shipments will be at a similar level to the third quarter. Overall channel inventories of GARDASIL have decreased, which is directionally encouraging while inventory at Zhifei remains above historical levels. We are highly focused on this market and are making progress with Zhifei to increase promotional resources and patient education efforts. We expect these efforts to translate to increased patient activation and demand. But as we've said, this will take time. Taking a step back, we're proud of the role that GARDASIL is playing in helping prevent certain HPV-related cancers. There's a wide range of long-term growth opportunities around the world due to the tremendous remaining need to protect more individuals with less than 10% of the global eligible population vaccinated and meaningful opportunities to improve vaccination completion rates, gender-neutral vaccination rates, mid-adult coverage and access in low and middle-income markets. This includes in China, where there is an attractive long-term opportunity, given the significant number of females yet to be immunized and the potential approval for males next year. We're highly focused on using our scale and strong capabilities to drive education and awareness of the benefits of HPV vaccination and to reach and protect more patients globally. As such, we remain confident in our goal of achieving greater than $11 billion of sales by 2030. Turning to our research efforts. We achieved important clinical and business development milestones this quarter. Starting with our clinical advancements in vaccines, we presented positive Phase 2b/3 results for clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants. Based on its differentiated profile and robust clinical data, we believe this opportunity is underappreciated. We're moving swiftly to make this important prevention option available in the U.S. during the '25-'26 RSV season. In pneumococcal, ACIP voted to expand vaccination recommendations for CAPVAXIVE to include adults ages 50 to 64. We're pleased to bring CAPVAXIVE's effectiveness and protecting against invasive pneumococcal disease to this new cohort of patients, and this recommendation reinforces our confidence in its blockbuster commercial potential. In oncology, it's been 10 years since KEYTRUDA's first U.S. approval, and we remain highly focused on advancing standard of care and maintaining durable leadership in oncology. At ESMO, we presented overall survival and long-term follow-up data for KEYTRUDA and data also were shared from our innovative ADCs, underscoring our commitment to building a broad and diverse oncology pipeline. In infectious diseases, we shared Phase 2 data from our collaboration with Gilead for the combination of once-weekly oral islatravir and lenacapavir for HIV treatment in treatment-experienced adults. This data represents just a portion of our broad HIV development efforts to further advance the field. In immunology, we shared positive Phase 2 maintenance data for our investigational TL1A candidate tulisokibart in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease that adds to positive prior clinical results. Both our HIV and immunology programs address patient populations with significant remaining unmet need despite available therapies. Our investments in these therapeutic areas reflect our belief in the opportunity to deliver additional value to patients and fortify our sustainable innovation engine for the long term. Regarding business development, we continue to leverage our scientific expertise to identify promising therapeutic targets that can further broaden and fortify our pipeline. This quarter, we acquired a novel investigational bispecific T-cell engager from Curon with potential applications in both oncology and immunology, complementing our efforts in each of these areas of high unmet need, and we closed the acquisitions of EyeBio and the Elanco aqua business. In summary, we remain highly focused on strong commercial and operational execution to enable access to our medicines and vaccines. We're also continuing to make strategic investments in our pipeline that we're confident will lead to important innovations for patients and future growth drivers for our company. I want to again recognize the commitment and efforts of our team across the world. Based on our continued progress, I'm more confident in our longer term future today than I was a year ago, and I believe that Merck is even better positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders long into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Great. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we're very focused on GARDASIL in China, but maybe just to step back for a second. And we continue to be very proud of the contribution that GARDASIL is making for patients and people around the world to really address and hopefully eliminate long-term cervical cancer as well as other HPV-related cancers. So that important work will continue -- and importantly, as we commented in our prepared remarks, while China did decline, and I'll speak to China in a second. Overall, we saw strong double-digit growth in really nearly every other region around the world, which is showing the progress we're making and which is why we continue to have such confidence in the long-term potential for this. But as it relates to China specifically, and as we think about 2025, I don't want to give specific guidance because obviously, we're still working through our 2025 plan. But what I would say is we do expect to continue to see a decline in shipments into China into 2025. And as we had highlighted before, this is happening a little bit earlier than we originally expected, but we had always expected that over time, as we work through the bolus, we would see the female opportunity decline and then hopefully seeing growth come with bringing the mail opportunity, which we would expect to see with approval, assuming it comes next year. So that's how we see it progressing. So as we think about 2025, we see China really in the $2 billion to $3 billion range as far as an opportunity for 2025 and for the next several years with the opportunity in males really being the growth driver. And at that level, we would expect for overall Merck that you're going to continue to see based on the portfolio we have solid growth. So I think that's just important to kind of frame where we're seeing things. But understanding, we're focused on this. We're bringing our efforts to drive demand and we're going to make progress. We are making progress, but it's going to take some time. Yes. I'll maybe let Dean start and then I can jump in. Yes. So just to give you a sense of what we're seeing in the marketplace as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing the sickest patients being predominantly about 80% of the patients we have today. So those would be people on triple therapy. And as we're looking at the kits being used, we're still predominantly seeing use of single vials, not double vials as we're still bringing a lot of people onto therapy, remember that when a patient starts therapy, they start on a single vial and then they would transition either to maintaining on single or going to double depending on their weight over time. So we expect to see, as we saw with STELLAR that you would end up with about two-third of patients would be on the single vial and about one-third of patients on the double vial right now, that's a little bit more skewed towards single, but we expect it still to get there over time. And importantly, on your broader question, Dean gave one sense about where we see safety. I think the best real-world statement around safety we're seeing very strong adherence and really seeing less discontinuations than we expected. So the anecdotal information we're getting from the marketplace as far as the rural world experience, I would say, as said that safety is not an issue. Yes. I'll turn it over to Caroline for that. Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, I feel very good about the business development we've done, including some of the transactions that Dean just highlighted in the prepared remarks, and we're going to continue to look to do more. So while we feel good about where we are. And actually, as I made a comment in the prepared remarks, we have more Phase 3 assets now than we had was more than tripled that from where we were 3 years ago and with more than 20. So we have a lot there, but we need to add more. And we're looking across all therapeutic areas. Our approach remains where it's always been, which is we start with the science, and where we see a scientific opportunity that addresses an unmet need and where we think Merck can strategically play, if we see that aligned with value, we will act as it relates to obesity, our goal and strategy there continues to be focusing on the second and third generation opportunities in that space. We've talked in the past, thinking more of a focus on oral opportunities and those that can be in combination focused on outcomes that go beyond just obesity but to actually medical outcomes. So we continue to look but we're going to be disciplined. And if we don't see something where we think it makes sense from a value perspective and a strategy, we won't move. Beyond that, I would say, you should continue to see us look in areas of oncology immunology and broader cardio metabolic, all the places where we're playing today are areas where we continue to look for opportunities down the road. From a capacity perspective, just to be clear, we continue to think we have capacity, frankly, to do pretty much anything of any size. But our focus area continues to be mainly in that $1 billion to $15 billion range. Yes. Maybe, Dean, do you want to start, and we can jump in? Yes. So, to give you just a sense of where we are, and we don't normally give product level guidance or specifics on a quarterly basis. But given the importance and focus on GARDASIL, just to give you a sense of where we were with China, GARDASIL in the third quarter. It's about approximately $500 million in the third quarter. And as we said, we would expect to ship about the same amount in the fourth quarter. So you should expect that the fourth quarter itself would also be in that $500 million range. And so that kind of gives you a sense of where we are. So as you look forward to 2025, obviously, as we think in 2025 and over the next several years, if you're running in that $2 billion to $3 billion range, that's why we made the comment that with that and given the other opportunities we see around the world, we remain confident in our ability to get to the $11 billion by 2030. So we are contemplating that $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years in China as the contribution that it would make to get us to where we need, understanding also that long term, we do expect to be able to have the potential for growth driven by the male opportunity in China and then obviously continuing to drive more broadly around the rest of the world. Yes. So, I'll take the first part of that question, Terence. So the answer is yes. The $2 billion to $3 billion over the next several years does include male, but we have the opportunity as you look longer term to drive growth with that opportunity. That was really the point we were trying to make. Yes. So if you look at what's happening in the overall marketplace and just to give you a sense, from an inventory perspective, maybe starting there. If you look at overall inventory levels in China, they did come down. And that's taking into account and this is for GARDASIL. GARDASIL and Zhifei, which frankly remains high and grew slightly but that was more than offset by reductions in the CDCs and the points of vaccination. So that's a good sign that we're seeing overall inventories coming down, which also would point to the fact that as we're looking at demand, which we're seeing stabilize, we think we're at a position now whereas we're starting to talk about what we're shipping. Our expectation is we are shipping below demand. So we have been working very constructively with Zhifei to think about this, both is what we're doing in this year is, frankly, as well as we're continuing to have constructive dialogue around 2025. Our intention would be to balance the need to get product into the marketplace to meet the demand at the same time, allowing for Zhifei to bring down their inventories over time. So we're very thoughtful on how we're thinking about it, and we've done that, taking into account our expectations of both the female competitive launch that could come next year, but also the opportunity that a male approval early next year could allow us to have. So all of those factors are in as we think about that $2 billion to $3 billion number. Well, what we're talking about taking time is basically to work down the inventory and to then build demand over time so that we can continue to drive that market. What we're giving you is kind of what we see as the baseline of China. Our hope is that we'll do better. And we're going to put the work in to do better and to continue to drive long term. I think that what I'm trying to make sure everyone hears is this isn't going to be solved next quarter. It's going to take us through probably 2025, but we're thoughtful on how we're doing it. We're working with Zhifei in a constructive manner to do it. So those are the elements are going to take time because we need to build the demand. We know the opportunity is there with 120 million females still out there to go after and with potentially 200 million males with the male opportunity. We have to activate that demand to make sure we can drive that business. So that's really what we're focusing on. As far as it relates to GARDASIL for 2025, I don't think we really want to get into giving product line guidance right now. We were very specific to China because of the concerns that were there. And I wanted to make sure, that we see solid overall growth for Merck because that's important to have context. But beyond that, we normally wouldn't be giving guidance at this point in time."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Davis: Thanks Peter. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. Our business is demonstrating strong momentum as we exit the first half of the year. We remain guided by our purpose of harnessing the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. Our ambitious and dedicated teams are working tirelessly to reach more patients with our broad commercial portfolio and advance our deep pipeline with the goal of delivering future innovations that solve for additional unmet medical needs. Through excellent scientific, commercial and operational execution, we\u2019re achieving significant milestones for our company and for patients. This quarter, we\u2019re proud to have successfully launched WINREVAIR, which has introduced a novel mechanism to treat adults suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We\u2019re also pleased by the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE, the first approved pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults, as well as the subsequent ACIP recommendation. Both of these important innovations demonstrate our unwavering commitment to creating value for patients and shareholders. And we remain committed to the execution of strategic business development to further augment our pipeline. We recently announced and have now closed the acquisition of EyeBio, which expands our effort in ophthalmology and brings to Merck a novel, late-phase candidate for the treatment of retinal diseases. This promising new mechanism adds another substantial potential commercial opportunity to our expanding pipeline in an area of significant unmet medical need. In addition, our Animal Health business closed the acquisition of Elanco\u2019s aqua business, which establishes Merck as a leader in this important production animal category. 3 years ago, I was honored to step into the role of CEO, and it remains my top priority to uphold and build on Merck\u2019s legacy as a premier science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company. At that time, I affirmed Merck\u2019s strategic commitment to the research and development of innovative medicines and vaccines as the source of long-term value creation. I communicated our intention to be appropriately aggressive in making the necessary investments to both advance our broad internal pipeline and augment it with the best external science through business development. Since then, we\u2019ve made substantial progress in expanding and evolving our pipeline to the benefit of future patients. We have the potential to bring as many new drugs to market in the next 5 years as we launched over the last 10 years, across a greater number of therapeutic areas and modalities, and with a significant proportion having blockbuster-plus potential. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress building on our past successes, enabling the creation of a sustainable engine that will drive future innovations for patients. And we continue to leverage our scientific prowess to identify new therapeutic targets where we can add value through our expertise in clinical development and regulatory affairs, and our global commercial scale. I\u2019m also proud of the substantial improvements we\u2019ve made across our sustainability focus areas. We\u2019re reaching more people with our medicines and vaccines across a greater number of countries globally than ever before, and doing so with a dedicated, highly talented and diverse employee base. Finally, we\u2019re driving increased innovation and productivity through widespread integration of data, digital and analytics in all areas of our business. Going forward, I\u2019m committed to ensuring our actions remain aligned with our strategy, and I\u2019m confident that we are well positioned to deliver value to patients and shareholders long into the future. Turning to our second quarter results, we achieved strong growth, reflecting continued demand across our broad portfolio, which is reflected in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in just a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts and new launches. In cardiometabolic, we\u2019ve seen very favorable reception by physicians, patients and payors to the availability of WINREVAIR. While still early, the U.S. launch has gone very well, in line with our own high expectations. We\u2019ve deployed a focused, customer-centric rare disease model and are pleased to see an increasing number of prescriptions being written and patients obtaining access. We\u2019ve also received a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to potential regulatory approval in Europe in the near future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of patients living with this devastating disease. In vaccines, we continue to bring forward innovations for both adults and children. We are proud of the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, and the unanimous ACIP recommendation. Given its compelling clinical profile, we expect that CAPVAXIVE will achieve a majority market share in the adult setting. We were also pleased to announce positive topline results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants, and we are moving swiftly to bring this important option to market. Finally, at our ASCO investor event, we highlighted the significant broadening of our oncology pipeline and the progress we\u2019ve made in building on the success of KEYTRUDA. We presented data for multiple novel candidates, demonstrating our commitment to advancing standards of care and maintaining leadership over the long term. As a company, we remain highly focused and continue to work with urgency to bring forward these innovations, and others, for the patients we serve. In summary, I want to again recognize the tremendous efforts of our global team. Together, we\u2019ve made significant progress across our diverse pipeline and portfolio. As a company, we\u2019ve been advancing science for the benefit of patients for over 130 years, and I\u2019m confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders well into the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Caroline.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another excellent quarter, with growth driven by robust global demand across our innovative portfolio. These results are enabled by the excellent execution of our teams and reinforce the conviction we have in our science-led strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term, and are committed to making disciplined investments in compelling science to drive long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.1 billion, an increase of 7%, or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum with double-digit growth of 11% primarily driven by Oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance, with sales increasing 6%, driven by growth in livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In the earlier-stage setting, the increase was largely attributable to uptake from KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091 in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA has now achieved market leadership in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, building on its existing leadership position as adjuvant therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw continued strong uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev has now surpassed platinum chemotherapy-based regimens in new patient starts. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased use in certain earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and intermediate-high or high risk renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima each grew 4%. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $126 million driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma. Our vaccines portfolio delivered solid growth. GARDASIL sales increased 4% to $2.5 billion. In the U.S., sales benefitted from price as well as demand and favorable CDC purchasing patterns. Outside the U.S., higher demand across many international markets was partially offset by the timing of shipments to China. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 16% to $189 million. Growth was driven by ongoing launches in international markets. As Rob noted, we are very excited by the opportunity to positively impact the lives of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension following the recent U.S. launch of WINREVAIR. Recall, we received FDA approval on March 26th, with the first patients receiving therapy about one month later. Initial patient and physician feedback has been favorable, and we recorded $70 million of sales in the quarter. We estimate that approximately 40% of sales were attributable to doses administered to patients, with the remainder due to distributors building inventory in support of increasing demand. The launch is off to a strong start. As of the end of June, more than 2,000 patients received a prescription for WINREVAIR. Our experience to date with those prescriptions, would suggest that approximately 75% to 80% will receive commercial product. Of those, more than 1,000 patients started treatment in the quarter, largely reflecting prescriptions written in April and May, as it currently takes approximately one month to complete the steps necessary to commence therapy. More than 500 physicians have written at least one prescription, with many looking to gain experience with the product as they prioritize treating the most advanced patients, who are in greatest need of additional therapy. Most prescribers are from either large academic centers or larger private practices. We are pleased that payors are recognizing the value of WINREVAIR and are already providing access to patients. Many payors have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. In summary, we are pleased with the strong start and look forward to continued progress in enabling access for appropriate patients over the coming months. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6%. Livestock sales grew 11% driven by higher demand for poultry and ruminant products as well as price. Companion animal sales grew 1%, reflecting price partially offset by a reduction in distributor inventory. We are also excited to have launched a long-acting BRAVECTO injectable in a number of international markets during June. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.9%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased to $6.2 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with a $10.2 billion charge a year ago. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting strategic investments to realize the promise of our robust early- and late-phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $108 million. Our tax rate was 14.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.28. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.4 and $64.4 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million at the midpoint. Our increased guidance range represents strong year over year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We now expect operating expenses to be between $26.8 and $27.6 billion. This range reflects an incremental $1.5 billion of charges related to the one-time cost to acquire EyeBio and ongoing expenses to advance the assets, as well as investments to progress our innovative pipeline. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Expense is expected to be approximately $350 million, which now includes financing costs for the acquisitions of EyeBio and Elanco\u2019s aqua business. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 15.5% and 16.5%, which includes an unfavorable impact related to the EyeBio acquisition that is not tax-deductible. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.94 to $8.04. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $8.53 to $8.65. Including the one-time charge of $1.3 billion, or $0.51 per share, related to the acquisition of EyeBio and an estimated $0.09 to advance the assets as well as finance the EyeBio and Elanco aqua business transactions, our prior guidance range would have been $7.93 to $8.05, with a midpoint of $7.99. Our current guidance midpoint remains the same as our higher revenue estimate is being offset by increased investments to support our business. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. We look forward to the opportunity to help protect certain adults from invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia following the recent FDA approval and ACIP recommendation of CAPVAXIVE. We are now working toward the achievement of certain milestones that will enable commercial uptake. These milestones include publication in the morbidity and mortality weekly report, which typically lags an ACIP recommendation by a few months, as well as obtaining payor coverage and contracting with customers. For GARDASIL, over the past few years we\u2019ve benefitted from extremely strong demand in China, including from the expanded indication for GARDASIL 9 to the 9 to 45 year age cohort in late 2022. In the second quarter however, there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. We are working closely with them to more fully understand the dynamics that caused this change. As we learn more, we will assess future shipments to our partner and work to bring their inventory back to more normal levels. If shipments from Zhifei into the points of vaccination do not increase it is likely that we will ship less than our full year 2024 contracted doses by the end of this year. We believe the opportunity in China remains very attractive as there are more than 120 million females in the addressable population living in Tier 1 to Tier 5 cities who have not yet received the protection of an HPV vaccine. As we said before, it will take increasing efforts to educate and activate the next wave of patients. Together with Zhifei, we are focused on and committed to investing in additional resources and patient education on the value of GARDASIL given the important benefits it provides. We also look forward to the potential approval for males which we believe represents a meaningful opportunity. More broadly, we remain confident in the opportunity for GARDASIL globally based on the protection it provides against HPV-related cancers and low immunization levels overall, and continue to believe we will achieve sales of over $11 billion by 2030. Our initial launch of WINREVAIR is having a positive impact for patients. We are very pleased with its performance and look forward to supporting more patients in the U.S. and across the globe. Outside the U.S., we are pleased with the positive CHMP opinion and potential near-term launch in Europe. Following EU approval, we will need to obtain reimbursement, which should occur in 2025 in most major markets, but expect that Germany will receive reimbursement and launch this year. We remain confident in the successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our high expectations, and look forward to providing further updates on our progress. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our expansive pipeline of novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, there is continued strength in our business, driven by global demand and commercial execution. We remain confident in our outlook, driven by our unwavering commitment to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve the lives of patients. With investment in innovation and our ongoing focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Dean.\nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. Momentum continued in the second quarter with several clinical and regulatory milestones, as well as progress in our science-led business development strategy. Today, I will speak first to programs in vaccines, then cover oncology, followed by cardiometabolic disease. As Rob noted, last month the FDA approved CAPVAXIVE our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and we subsequently received a unanimous recommendation from the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, for its use in certain adult populations. CAPVAXIVE is the first vaccine specifically designed to help protect adults against pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease and, as such, provides an important new public health option. It has been designed to address those serotypes responsible for approximately 85% of the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 years and older, based on CDC generated surveillance data. The CAPVAXIVE marketing authorization application is also under review by the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We continue to evaluate novel approaches to alleviate the burden of infectious disease. Recently, we announced positive topline results for clesrovimab, our investigational respiratory syncytial virus preventative antibody, a single, fixed-dose option to help protect infants from birth through their first full RSV season. In the Phase 2b/3 trial, clesrovimab met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints as well as its secondary endpoint regarding RSV-associated hospitalization. Detailed findings of the study will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress and we plan to file these data with global regulatory authorities. Globally, RSV infection is a leading cause of hospitalization for otherwise healthy infants under one year of age. The historically high surge in incidence in the 2022, 2023 season reinforced the need for more effective preventative measures. Now to oncology. During the investor event at ASCO, we detailed how we have leveraged our foundational position with KEYTRUDA to create a diverse pipeline by executing on our three pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting candidates. This quarter, tangible progress has been made across each of these pillars. In immuno-oncology, we received FDA approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy for the treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer regardless of mismatch repair status, based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-868 study. Data continues to flow from the KEYTRUDA clinical development program including from studies which achieve an overall survival benefit, the gold standard for many oncology trials. We announced an overall survival benefit in high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer based on the KEYNOTE-522 study. KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive approval for nine earlier stage indications, of which four have now demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit including in non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and most recently, triple negative breast cancer. We were pleased to announce that KEYNOTE-811 met its overall survival dual primary endpoint for the first line treatment of patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. These results build on the previously reported positive data that formed the basis for the FDA approval last year. A similar approval was received from the National Medical Products Administration in China this quarter. Also in immuno-oncology, the FDA granted priority review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on the overall survival benefit demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-483 trial. The FDA has set a target action date of September 25th. KEYTRUDA has now received approval for 40 distinct indications in the U.S. and has demonstrated statistically significant overall survival in 25 trials. Next to precision molecular targeting, we exercised the exclusive development option to advance the program for opevesostat, an oral nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP11A1, through our collaboration with Orion. Two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating opevesostat in combination with hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic prostate cancer, OMAHA-1 and OMAHA-2, are ongoing. Lastly, in the tissue targeting space, The European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. We are also advancing a broad portfolio of diverse antibody-drug conjugates with Kelun-Biotech and Daiichi Sankyo, as well as our own internal programs. Last month, together with Daiichi Sankyo, we announced receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for the Biologics License Application for patritumab deruxtecan, for the treatment of certain adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The letter was issued based on findings from an inspection of a third-party manufacturing site. We are working with Daiichi Sankyo to provide appropriate support as they work with the FDA and the manufacturer to address the feedback in a timely manner. Of note, the findings identified in the CRL have no bearing on either ifinatamab deruxtecan nor raludotatug deruxtecan. Turning to cardiometabolic disease, as Caroline indicated there is strong interest from physicians and patients for WINREVAIR in the U.S. Building on this momentum, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommending the approval of WINREVAIR as a treatment option for certain patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The European Commission\u2019s decision on the marketing authorization application is expected in the third quarter. Finally, we continue to execute on our science-led business development strategy with a focus on seamlessly integrating efforts across our internal pipeline with the best external science through our One Pipeline approach. We recently closed the acquisition of EyeBio that includes Restoret, MK-3000, an investigational, late phase, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific Wnt antibody candidate for diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, as well as additional preclinical assets targeting retinal diseases. There remains a significant medical need in this space and our teams are eager to work alongside the talented EyeBio team to advance these promising candidates. In closing, over the past 3-plus years, we have successfully built on the solid foundation established by the previous leadership team to assemble one of the strongest pipelines in recent memory. We have diversified in oncology while strengthening and expanding in other therapeutic areas including cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience and vaccines. We have strong momentum and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress. And now I turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Brad, we're ready for Q&A now. And I request that analysts limit themselves to one question today. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much for the question and congrats on the progress. I just want to kick off with just a question on GARDASIL dynamics in China. Maybe just a 2-part question here. First, can you quantify what percent of your international sales are coming from China? And just any additional color on what drove the step down in 2Q. I'm trying to get my hands around this. And maybe as part of that, the 2024 guidance update is the potential for shipments to come below the 2024 contracted doses now reflected in that guidance? Or would that represent an incremental headwind to numbers to the extent that played out? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question. And I'll maybe take the first part and then ask Caroline to comment on guidance. To your question, China represents about for GARDASIL about 60% to 70% of the numbers. So that kind of gives you a sense of it. But maybe to give some context on what we saw in the quarter and as we look to the full year and where we see things going. So let me start maybe by talking a little bit about the dynamics. The opportunity that exists for GARDASIL in China remains very attractive with more than 120 million eligible females in China yet to be protected against HPV, which represents about 60% to 70% of the eligible population. And I think we all recognize the benefits of protection against HPV-related diseases is clear and importantly, aligns with China's Healthy 2030 initiative. So the underlying support, we continue to believe is there. In addition, we have filed for the male indication, which has been accepted and represents another significant opportunity. So as we think about China, I just want to set the context because I think it's important to understand, we continue to have a very meaningful opportunity in the China market. What's unclear to us and what we're trying to understand is that during the second quarter, we saw a significant step down in shipments from Zhifei [ph] to the points of vaccination. The reductions during the second quarter was surprising, and I would point out was a meaningful departure from prior trends we've seen both throughout really all of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024. So as we look at this, we're wanting to understand what would cause the trend break we saw. And I can tell you what we know as of now is we believe there could be multiple factors that may be contributing to this dynamic, and we're working closely with our partner to try to tease out what exactly is happening. But overall, the data we track indicates that the whole HPV market in China experienced this step down. So this is not a Merck-specific event. And importantly, we see the market share for GARDASIL as stable or actually increasing right now in the marketplace. We don't believe this step down, therefore, represents any change in the competitive dynamic and GARDASIL remains by far the market leader. We do believe, however, that based on the intelligence we've gathered, activity in the HPV vaccine area has been recently impacted by China's anti-bribery and anticorruption drive, which, as you know, started really last year. And up to that point, we really haven't seen much impact, but we do believe we are starting to see it now. And this is really driven by the fact that in the health care industry, there has been as a result of this, a reduction in scientific engagement, primarily in the CDC within China and fewer immunizations. So we need to tease that out more. And in addition, we did see reduced levels of promotional support for HPV vaccination at the same time that our distribution partner, Zhifei [ph] broadened its portfolio. So we'll need to get more into that. But obviously, we have a very strong relationship with Zhifei, and we already have started to put in place a robust plan to invest in increased promotional efforts really designed to drive awareness, education and activation of the remaining female opportunity, and this includes both resources at Zhifei and more selling resources and promotional resources as well as promotional resources being deployed directly from Merck. So as we look forward, we will have to see how all of these activities impact shipments to the point of vaccination. And as we learn more, we'll assess future shipments to China with our partner. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what we're seeing, but I just would reiterate one other point. And that's -- that as we look to the long term, given both the opportunity in China, I mentioned for the 120 million remaining females as well as the potential for the male indication, outside of China, we saw double-digit growth across all regions in the quarter. So we continue to be on track, doing well and driving growth in this important vaccine. And that's why you heard Caroline in our prepared comments reiterate our confidence in the $11 billion number by 2030, even taking into account what we saw China happening - in China this quarter. So with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Caroline and she can address your guidance specific question. Caroline?\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. So Chris, in terms of our guidance, we've assumed a range of scenarios from providing the fully contracted 2024 doses during this year to providing something less than that. If I anchor to the midpoint of our guidance, we have been measured in assuming a scenario that has less than the contracted 2024 GARDASIL doses shipped to China. And even with that, we were able to raise our guidance at the midpoint by $200 million. And that's really as a result of the underlying momentum that we have in the rest of our business, including oncology, with KEYTRUDA and WELIREG. It includes in animal health with the launch of BRAVECTO in injectable, as well as the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business, and we remain confident in our outlook for WINREVAIR and the opportunities to drive patient impact and growth consistent with our high expectations.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line is open.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can I just dial down the GARDASIL point just a little more. Rob, I know you mentioned there's an anti-bribery, anticorruption drive going on in China, which started last year. But it also feels like some of the shipment delays are happening, perhaps a few months ahead of potential competition hitting the market as well. So could you speak to whether there's any future contracting happening and whether your long-term price integrity will stay intact on GARDASIL in China? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. No, thanks for the question. So everything we're seeing in the marketplace, I would just reiterate, would point to dynamics that we don't see the competition, the future potential competition. And I think you're referring to the fact that we very well could see a 9-valent sometime next year come into the marketplace. So I don't believe from anything we've heard in the marketplace from competitive intelligence as well as what we're hearing from Zhifei that, that is what's happening here. As we look forward, and Caroline can comment specifically, we have always expected that as we see the peak move through from the indication we got for the expansion of the age cohort that you would see a flattening out over time of the demand in China. And then that for women, specifically, and then we would bring on the male indications that should allow us then to continue to drive the business forward from there. Nothing has changed in that dynamic in what we're seeing right now. So as we look forward, our belief in China being a significant contributor is unchanged. But I'll let maybe Caroline can speak specifically as we're thinking about some of the guidance around how we think about next year.\nCaroline Litchfield: So what I would add is we have always contemplated that we would have a 9-valent competitor within the Chinese market. As such, the current contracted doses with Zhifei for 2025 are less than what the contract is for 2024 as we would expect to participate in that market but understand a competitor would likely gain share in that market. We also, though, as we said in the prepared remarks, has the potential opportunity of a male launch in China. And we are hopeful for an approval with GARDASIL 4 and 9 by first half of next year and be coming to the market at that stage. So we are confident that China will remain an important part of our GARDASIL business as we move forward, and more importantly, are confident in the opportunity to drive GARDASIL longer term to the $11 billion that we've stated.\nRob Davis: Yes. And maybe, Umer, just to give one little bit of color because it's probably worth pointing out, I'm assuming people understand when we talk about the anti-bribery and anticorruption what is happening. And one question that could be there is this has been going on since late last year, and we did not see impacts early on, what's changed and how do we see it evolving. And what I would point out, first of all, one, just reiterate, as we think about what's happening in China around the anti-bribery and anticorruption we very much support those activities because it means we have a fair, open and transparent market. So we're very supportive of what the Chinese government is trying to do there. But as we see how this is impacting us at the CDC, we have seen some dampening in them engaging in scientific discussions and driving for vaccination. We believe some of this could be due to the fact that there was criminal charges brought against a senior scientific representative of one of the local players related to a COVID vaccine that we believe has had a dampening effect overall. And how long this lasts, how it will continue to play out, we'll have to see. But I thought I would provide additional color because I don't want to assume that you all are aware of what really is happening there.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks. Umer. Next question please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Carter Gould of Barclays. Your line is open.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just switch gears and talk about WINREVAIR a bit. Can you maybe characterize or maybe going to -- in terms of the pace of new starts, do you see that sort of as sustainable or surpassable? And as we think about the sort of that 1-month delayed time line from prescription to start, can you maybe characterize how much of that is sort of payer versus sort of the nurse training driven? And if there's a chance that might evolve? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. No, thanks for the question. So to give you a sense of what we've seen as of the end of June, we've had more than 2,000 patients receive a prescription for WINREVAIR. So that's -- obviously, we feel very good about that. And right now, what our experience would tell us is that about 75% to 80% of those receiving a prescription will convert to commercial product. So that gives you a sense of what's happening. Right now, actually, in the quarter, driving the revenue you saw was about 30 -- about 1,000 patients actually on treatment had started treatment. So as we sit here today, you have 1,000 patients who have started treatment in the quarter, the 2,000 total scripts, and we would expect that the 75% to 80% of those 2,000 scripts will ultimately convert to the commercial sales. And so if you look at what's driving that difference, some of that is due to access, but also some of it is due to patient dropout and the fact that you will have some patients who despite getting a script after they go through blood [ph] work and go through the medical evaluations don't qualify. So you have all of those dynamics happening. If you look at the 30 days and specifically that you're referring to, we think that probably the total period from when a person gets a script to when they get their approval for -- from an access perspective is about 2 weeks to 3 weeks. So there is obviously opportunity to improve that. But just remember that in addition to going and getting a blood test, getting your insurance approval, you then have to schedule to have a nurse come to your home to go through the initiation and training around administration -- self-administration of WINREVAIR. So all of those elements are contributing to that time frame, how much of that time over time we'll have to see.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Carter. Next question please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Anderson of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nTim Anderson: Oh, thank you very much. Just going back to GARDASIL. I know you're reiterating your $11 billion figure, at least $11 billion in 2030. The shape of the curve over that time in China specifically, which is only a part of that number, are there likely to be periods where year-on-year sales actually contract beyond 2024 in the inventory issue? Because it does seem like pricing is really going to be a risk here, the way pricing works with vaccines in China and some of these other offsetting indications like males are going to take time to launch. So it seems like there may be periods there where you could have year-on-year declines in sales over the next, let's say, 5 or 6 years. So if you could just describe the shape of that curve, please?\nRob Davis: Yes, sure. So as we look at it, we do expect you will see a flattening of the curve as we see the female indication, be more fully penetrated. Obviously, more to go there, given what we believe is still the addressable population. And then it will ramp back to growth as the male population comes on in full. So that is what we're expecting to happen. And on the pricing point, I think it's just important to understand the way this market works and how we operate in the market. We sell into Zhifei, Zhifei then is responsible for doing the bidding with the provinces and actually then determining ultimately that end sale to the point of vaccination. As we look forward, I think it's important to understand that GARDASIL as we think about the addressable population, we continue to believe we'll be a highly sought after vaccine even in the face of competition, and we're dealing in an overall population when we quote the $200 million total females of which we would say we're 30% to 40% penetrated today. That's really in the Tier 1 to 5 cities that we think can afford a cash pay market. The total population accessible in China is much bigger and so I don't think we should assume we're all competing for that small slice. There's a much bigger slice. We have chosen not to go for that bigger piece because obviously, we can't get into the local vaccination program because we don't produce GARDASIL in China. Our competitors will be able to do that. So I think I would just caution all to not view it as a zero-sum game. I think there's still a market expansion opportunity in China that will benefit both us and the competitors. And frankly, the other thing we have to see is how quickly will the male indication be given to others beyond us. We believe there's a chance we could be sitting alone with that as well. So the dynamics need to play themselves out. But I think we need to first understand what we're seeing in the quarter specific, a short-term event or something else. And that's still not clear because I would just point that the trend break was pretty significant. It's not what we've seen in any of the markets that you would expect. And that's why we're a little hesitant to say this is just demand in China. And also, I would also bring back the fact that actually, if you separated out what happened in China, we had one of our strongest quarters in every other market around the world with strong double-digit growth. So that's -- those are all dynamics that we'll have to play themselves out.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you. Tim. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Scala of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. How does clesrovimab compare on hospitalizations to Beyfortus [ph] which has 85% to 90% effectiveness on hospitalizations. I appreciate you're not going to give out data specifics. But for instance, would you say your product is highly competitive. And I'm just curious, how does it achieve longer durability given that it has a shorter half-life than Beyfortus? Thank you.\nDean Li: Yes. So this is Dean. Thanks for the question. As you point out, there is a significant global unmet need both for the healthy and at-risk infants. And as we've said, from the PKPD studies as such, this is something that can be given as a single dose. It's not weight-based, so single dose broadly. And we are very comfortable in relationship to the PKPD in relationship with the half-life in relationship to the affinity that's the prevention, which was studied would cover the entire RSV season, which is 5, 6 months. We did announce the top line. We're not going to get ahead of the public presentation of these that we hope to have at some session in the second half. I do point out that what you highlight is really important, which is the RSV associated hospitalization will be a really important point in relationship to looking at this vaccine versus others, and we are very confident in that profile.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Steve. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And just to trying to understand the long-term growth path for GARDASIL, it seems like and correct me if I'm wrong, a lot of it, it would depend on raising awareness in those Tier 1 to 5 cities and male vaccination. So the question is, of those Tier 1, 2, 5 cities, where do you think there is bigger opportunity because, I mean, going to Tier 4 and 5 could be challenging. And then based on your main vaccination experience in the developed world, how should we think about China in that context? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. So if you look across the Tier 1 to 5 cities, we're actually -- when we quote that we're 30% to 40% penetrated, and again, this is just to the females. So this is -- we're only speaking to females right now. We're 30% to 40% penetrated. We're a little bit less penetrated, I think we're around kind of, say, 30th percent in the 4 and 5 Tier cities, and we're around 40% into 1 to 3. So there's not a huge spread between the Tier 1 to 3 and the 4 to 5. So we will continue to focus efforts across all of those areas as we have been to date. And then it's a whole different exercise to activate the male population across that same area, which is, frankly, doesn't -- isn't there today because of the fact that we don't yet have the indication. As you think about how all of this fits into the broader global picture, I think it's also important just to remind everyone that the total penetration of GARDASIL on a global basis to the eligible population is approximately 10%. So our opportunity to activate patients globally as we bring on additional capacity is significant. And as we've talked about in the past, we were going to continue to look to activate the mid adult segment in the private market. We're doing that today in Europe, and that's part of when I comment that we're driving double-digit growth across the rest of the world outside of China. Part of it is we are starting to see uptake in that private market activation, both in Europe and across parts of Latin America and Asia Pacific more broadly. We're going to continue to drive into the low and middle income markets, we see that as a meaningful opportunity going forward, and we are well on our way to getting our costs in a position to be able to compete in that space quite effectively. We will continue to drive that. And then obviously, while China is the best example of where we need to get a male indication to drive for gender-neutral vaccination if we truly want to eliminate cervical cancer and increasingly address the other cancers we know related to people with HPV, including head and neck cancers, which are very prominent, especially if you look across the Asia Pacific area. That is work we will continue to do, but not only in China and across Asia but also across Europe and other parts of the world where there still is a lot of opportunity to drive for gender neutral. And then lastly, Japan is a market where we are continuing to see growth driven by the fact that we've had a renewed NIP program there with both initial NIP and a catch-up phase and longer term opportunities for males there as well. So the opportunities are significant. The context of how we will drive growth has multiple levers for us to look at to do that. And that's why we are confident in the $11 billion number long term. And I think that's important as we shape the overall context of the discussion.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Mohit. We have availability to go a bit past 10, so we'll continue on with questions. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question is from Luisa Hector of Berenberg. Your line is open.\nLuisa Hector: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on RSV antibody, please. Can you confirm that you can file in all major markets this year? And then I just wondered about China in this context, is that a market where you'll be filing soon? And what the opportunity is there? How much education is required to access the private market? Thank you.\nDean Li: Yes. So let me just level set in relationship to clesrovimab, and the RSV antibody. So we have the data, and that data will be presented at some time in the second half of this year as the different plenary sessions of different conferences occur. In relationship to filing, our plan is to file such that it would be available, not for this season, but for the next season within the United States. And so that's the sort of next wave in relationship. So I want to make sure that there's no concept that this is coming out this RSV season. We're targeting next RSV season in relationship to when we're seeking approval and licensure.\nRob Davis: Yes. And maybe just on the broader question, could this be an opportunity in China. We are continuing to look at all global markets. And I would point out, as Dean points out, we're looking at the '25, '26 RSV season, so next year. And then beyond that, we will go globally thereafter. And China is a market we are looking at.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Luisa. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dana Graybosch of Leerink. Your line is open.\nDana Graybosch: Hi, thank you for the question. I want to ask about the recent ODAC that was on periadjuvant [ph] development in lung cancer. I wonder, let's assume FDA takes a hard line on requiring the contribution of the neoadjuvant and adjuvant phases. And you look forward to the current KEYTRUDA development program. Do you see any risk to that hard line to any of your label extension plans? And how are you going back to looking at your development, especially of novel combos in the early stage given that discussion. Thank you.\nRob Davis: Thank you very much. So just to provide some context, the recent outcome talked about how much of a PD-1 or a PD-L1 is put in earlier stage, especially in the resectable and there's giving it before the surgery, there's giving it after the surgery, and it's giving it before and after the surgery. And the issue that comes up is in this curative setting, what's the sort of relative benefit risk in, because it's different than in the metastatic. What I would just emphasize is we track and we are in discussions with the FDA in relationship to our clinical trials and such. But I do want to emphasize the ability to show OS especially in the earlier-stage cancers is very difficult. And that's why we always emphasize we have 9 earlier-stage approvals, but we highlight that 4 of them have overall survival, and we, at this point, do not know anyone else who has 4 overall survivals. I do want to point out that in 2 of those over survivals in TNBC and in lung, it is perioperative. So I think the future studies need to consider what the FDA has said, but the FDA has also been very clear that over survival is the gold standard, especially an earlier stage. And as we build our program, we consider both the recent AdCom, but also the recent -- with the continuing interest of the FDA to show contribution of components of a new agent on top of PD-1 and showing overall survival and using platforms that have overall survival to show that when you add something even more, you continue to have increasing benefit in terms of over survival.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Dana. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Akash Tewari of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAkash Tewari: Hey, thanks so much. And really helpful color on GARDASIL. Just one more here. Looking at the latest Zhifei contract, it looks like there's around $4.5 billion in potential sales for 2024. That's projected to decline in 2025 and 2026 to around $2.5 billion. Historically, however, it looks like you've always exceeded that contracted figure. So just to be clear, does the contracted decline in sales over the next 2 years bake in the upside for potential male approval? And should we expect the Zhifei contract to get renegotiated as we get further clarity on demand? Thanks so much.\nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you for the question. So the Zhifei contract that we have at this stage is focused on the current approval that we have in the market. So it's really focused on the female population in the cohort 9 through 45. As we move forward and we have a male indication, we will, of course, be working with our partner to have the appropriate doses so that we can protect as many males as possible.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Akash. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Trung Huynh of UBS. Your line is open.\nTrung Huynh: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one on CAPVAXIVE. During the ACIP at the end of June, there was a big discussion on the plus 50 population for the product. They never got around to reviewing it those. So is it possible we can get that looked at in October for a potential updated recommendation?\nRob Davis: Thank you so much for bringing that up. There was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of points that the ACIP working group have to vote on. And what they had said is that they were very interested in revisiting this in October. I want to be very clear that we have not had a formal confirmation of that reevaluation. But we did listen to the discussion. And the discussion was very clear that there was an interest in revisiting that in 50 to 64. And the data presented at the June ACIP meeting demonstrated or actually reinforced the ongoing burden of pneumococcal disease, especially in the 50-64 age group, most notably in the ratio of disparities. And I went back to the comments that were made by different individuals, but I focused on some of the points that those who actually vote in the ACIP, one resonated with me when that member said, the burden in 50 to 64-year-old black individuals is comparable to greater than 65 when we're all endorsing universal recommendation for over 65. And that member wondered whether we, which is the ACIP, was missing something too, by not deciding, and that we, the ACIP needed to decide at some point, and I hope we get there pretty soon in part because of the racial and ethnic disparities in the invasive disease. So we are very confident in our data, and we look forward to the ACIP considering this expanded age-based recommendation potentially in October, and we hope to find out at some appropriate time that they're going to formally confirm that reevaluation.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Thanks, Trung. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question is from Louise Chen of Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thank you for taking my question here. I wanted to ask you on WINREVAIR, how you think about sales in the third quarter of '24, given some stocking that we saw this quarter? Thank you.\nCaroline Litchfield: So thank you for the question, Louise. We feel that we're off to a really strong start with WINREVAIR. As we've described, as at the end of the quarter, we have 2,000 patients who now have the prescription for WINREVAIR, of which 75% to 80% historically have been receiving commercial product. So we're confident in what we expect for the profile for WINREVAIR in the third quarter. And we actually expect that the stock level should increase as more patients have prescribed the product. So we remain confident in the outlook for WINREVAIR consistent with the high expectations that we have.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Louise. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Shibutani of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. On business development, this is typically a question that you get closed in June, you did comment that the company does have an expressed interest in the cardiometabolic space, thinking about second and third generation opportunities potentially in weight management. Can you just provide us with the latest views, house used in terms of appetite, size, therapeutic area in particular noting obesity? Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, we discussed what we did in the quarter with EyeBio and Elanco aqua business, we're going to continue to follow the same strategy we've been looking at, which is really focusing on the science and looking at how can we best continue to drive where we see a scientific opportunity that matches our portfolio and our skill set to bring that in more on the earlier stage settings and with some mid late but clearly not commercialized products more to build the pipeline. So the continuation of the strategy we've been following. We continue to have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes. But as we've pointed out in the past, we tend to look in that $1 billion to $15 billion, is a good indication of where we would most likely play. And to the obesity question specifically, our view continues to be that if we can find opportunities to look at next-generation plays in that space, those will be things we will continue to evaluate and consider. We don't believe going after today's first generation is the place to play. So it will continue to be looking at second and third generation waves of innovation, whether it be around oral delivery, looking for where there's high tolerability, combinability and or preservation of muscle mass. Those are the areas of focus for us. And if we see something, we continue to have the capacity and the interest to act.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Brad.\nOperator: The next question is from Terence Flynn of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two part on WINREVAIR for me. I was just wondering if you think you've already worked through the initial bolus of patients in kind of late line or if there's more to go here for the second half? And then any color on background therapy in terms of the patients that have already started on sotatercept. Thank you.\nRob Davis: Yes. Maybe I'll start on the second part and then I'll come back to the first part. So on background therapy, you are seeing the vast majority of patients, as you would expect, are some of the sicker patients or who doctors are putting on the drug first. So there is a large amount on triple therapy or double therapy, and you are seeing uses with prostacyclin. So that is and frankly, consistent with what you would have seen in STELLAR as well. So we are seeing that pretty much as you'd expect. And then over time, we would expect to move into the earlier lines of therapy as we go. As it relates to what we see going forward with the bolus, I would say that we're -- it's not necessary that we think the bolus has been worked through. There's what I would tell you more broadly is we're seeing a continued growth in both the breadth and the depth of prescribers who are prescribing, which were at a little over 500 doctors now prescribing. We think there's probably somewhere in the 800 to 900 range of doctors that are doing the vast majority of prescribing out there. So we still have a ways to go to get to what I would consider to be heavy prescribers of the medicine. And as we see that group continuing to come in and as we continue to see access being granted because the other thing I would point out that, one, we feel very good. We have about a third of all lives are covered today under medical plan with a protocol in place for reimbursement related to WINREVAIR. We expect that to continue to grow because I would remind you that a lot of plans actually put in place just by the rule that they will wait 90 to 120 days-ish to put in place a plan -- a coverage plan after a drug is launched. So you have a lot of plans still yet to come. So because of the fact you're going to see increasing access, you're going to see the fact that we have increasing number of physicians, and we're continuing to see the breadth of patients grow, I think you're going to see continued trend for growth upward.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Terence. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Evan Seigerman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for the update today. So give me interest in the schizophrenia space with a number of readouts coming in the second half of the year. Can you characterize what we should expect from your Phase IIb trial of MK-8189? It looks like the study completed back in June. Just wondering when we might do the data on kind of how we should be comping this to the novel developments in the space?\nDean Li: Yes. So this is Dean. Thank you very much for that. Neuroscience question for MK-8189. I should just point out that I believe it was just in May that we published the Phase IIa, and it shows its efficacy and relationship to schizophrenia. But what was also interesting was that there was a reduction in body weight of around 6 pounds over just 4 weeks. And the reason why that's important is that oftentimes, it's not simply how efficacious the drug is. It's whether a patient will stay on and what are the adverse effects that will drive a patient not to take the drug. So that Phase IIa was really important that triggered the Phase IIb. So I'll just lay out that if we see things that are comparable to that Phase IIa and our Phase IIb, we would be eager to see such results.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Evan. Brad, one more question, please.\nOperator: Your final question comes from James Shin of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nJames Shin: Morning. Thank you for the question. For WINREVAIR the conversion of the 75% to 80% of scripts into commercial embedded within fiscal year '24 guide? And quickly, is there any time line on the INTerpath filing? Thank you.\nRob Davis: So the answer to your first question is yes. And the answer to the second question, I would let Dean address.\nDean Li: So in relationship to our collaboration with Moderna in relationship to the INT [ph], that's something that we're focused on getting the Phase III fully enrolled and to move forward as that's really important in relationship to how we will see the program and how the FDA will see that program.\nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, James, and thank you all for your good questions today. As always, the IR team is available for any follow-up questions. Rob, any closing comments that you'd like to make.\nRob Davis: No. No. I just want to thank you for your interest this morning. Hopefully, you appreciate the transparency with which we try to bring. But I maybe would close by just bringing back the confidence we see in the business, both in the short term and the long term. Obviously, we'll work through what we see happening with GARDASIL in China. But the fact that we see strengthening, and I would call them, green shoots around GARDASIL everywhere else in the world gives us confidence in the $11 billion for that, as we've talked about. But then beyond that, the growing breadth of our pipeline, obviously, KEYTRUDA continues to deliver meaningfully for the business and for patients. But I am growing in my own excitement for the breadth and depth of the pipeline we have coming. Hopefully, it wasn't lost on everyone that we pointed out, we would be launching more drugs in the next 5 years than we've launched in the last 10 many, many of which will be blockbuster plus opportunities. So the pipeline is maturing, and we're starting to see the green shoots of opportunity that continue to grow our confidence as we look to 2028 into the 2030s and beyond. And that's where we will continue to focus. But we will not take our eye off the short term where we are equally confident in the guidance, we raised revenue today. Obviously, we kind of were neutral on earnings, but that's because of the investment we're making into the business, bringing in even more opportunities like EyeBio. So there's a lot out there, and I just want to leave you with that note of what's driving my confidence and my appreciation for your support of the stock. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. Momentum continued in the second quarter with several clinical and regulatory milestones, as well as progress in our science-led business development strategy. Today, I will speak first to programs in vaccines, then cover oncology, followed by cardiometabolic disease. As Rob noted, last month the FDA approved CAPVAXIVE our 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and we subsequently received a unanimous recommendation from the CDC's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, for its use in certain adult populations. CAPVAXIVE is the first vaccine specifically designed to help protect adults against pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease and, as such, provides an important new public health option. It has been designed to address those serotypes responsible for approximately 85% of the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals 65 years and older, based on CDC generated surveillance data. The CAPVAXIVE marketing authorization application is also under review by the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use. We continue to evaluate novel approaches to alleviate the burden of infectious disease. Recently, we announced positive topline results for clesrovimab, our investigational respiratory syncytial virus preventative antibody, a single, fixed-dose option to help protect infants from birth through their first full RSV season. In the Phase 2b/3 trial, clesrovimab met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints as well as its secondary endpoint regarding RSV-associated hospitalization. Detailed findings of the study will be presented at an upcoming scientific congress and we plan to file these data with global regulatory authorities. Globally, RSV infection is a leading cause of hospitalization for otherwise healthy infants under one year of age. The historically high surge in incidence in the 2022, 2023 season reinforced the need for more effective preventative measures. Now to oncology. During the investor event at ASCO, we detailed how we have leveraged our foundational position with KEYTRUDA to create a diverse pipeline by executing on our three pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting candidates. This quarter, tangible progress has been made across each of these pillars. In immuno-oncology, we received FDA approval for the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy for the treatment of primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer regardless of mismatch repair status, based on the Phase 3 KEYNOTE-868 study. Data continues to flow from the KEYTRUDA clinical development program including from studies which achieve an overall survival benefit, the gold standard for many oncology trials. We announced an overall survival benefit in high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer based on the KEYNOTE-522 study. KEYTRUDA is the only PD-1 or PD-L1 to date to receive approval for nine earlier stage indications, of which four have now demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival benefit including in non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and most recently, triple negative breast cancer. We were pleased to announce that KEYNOTE-811 met its overall survival dual primary endpoint for the first line treatment of patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. These results build on the previously reported positive data that formed the basis for the FDA approval last year. A similar approval was received from the National Medical Products Administration in China this quarter. Also in immuno-oncology, the FDA granted priority review for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma based on the overall survival benefit demonstrated in the KEYNOTE-483 trial. The FDA has set a target action date of September 25th. KEYTRUDA has now received approval for 40 distinct indications in the U.S. and has demonstrated statistically significant overall survival in 25 trials. Next to precision molecular targeting, we exercised the exclusive development option to advance the program for opevesostat, an oral nonsteroidal inhibitor of CYP11A1, through our collaboration with Orion. Two pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating opevesostat in combination with hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of certain patients with metastatic prostate cancer, OMAHA-1 and OMAHA-2, are ongoing. Lastly, in the tissue targeting space, The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted a positive opinion recommending approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with Padcev for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. We are also advancing a broad portfolio of diverse antibody-drug conjugates with Kelun-Biotech and Daiichi Sankyo, as well as our own internal programs. Last month, together with Daiichi Sankyo, we announced receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA for the Biologics License Application for patritumab deruxtecan, for the treatment of certain adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The letter was issued based on findings from an inspection of a third-party manufacturing site. We are working with Daiichi Sankyo to provide appropriate support as they work with the FDA and the manufacturer to address the feedback in a timely manner. Of note, the findings identified in the CRL have no bearing on either ifinatamab deruxtecan nor raludotatug deruxtecan. Turning to cardiometabolic disease, as Caroline indicated there is strong interest from physicians and patients for WINREVAIR in the U.S. Building on this momentum, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommending the approval of WINREVAIR as a treatment option for certain patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The European Commission's decision on the marketing authorization application is expected in the third quarter. Finally, we continue to execute on our science-led business development strategy with a focus on seamlessly integrating efforts across our internal pipeline with the best external science through our One Pipeline approach. We recently closed the acquisition of EyeBio that includes Restoret, MK-3000, an investigational, late phase, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific Wnt antibody candidate for diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration, as well as additional preclinical assets targeting retinal diseases. There remains a significant medical need in this space and our teams are eager to work alongside the talented EyeBio team to advance these promising candidates. In closing, over the past 3-plus years, we have successfully built on the solid foundation established by the previous leadership team to assemble one of the strongest pipelines in recent memory. We have diversified in oncology while strengthening and expanding in other therapeutic areas including cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, neuroscience and vaccines. We have strong momentum and I look forward to providing further updates on our progress. And now I turn the call back to Peter. Yes. So this is Dean. Thanks for the question. As you point out, there is a significant global unmet need both for the healthy and at-risk infants. And as we've said, from the PKPD studies as such, this is something that can be given as a single dose. It's not weight-based, so single dose broadly. And we are very comfortable in relationship to the PKPD in relationship with the half-life in relationship to the affinity that's the prevention, which was studied would cover the entire RSV season, which is 5, 6 months. We did announce the top line. We're not going to get ahead of the public presentation of these that we hope to have at some session in the second half. I do point out that what you highlight is really important, which is the RSV associated hospitalization will be a really important point in relationship to looking at this vaccine versus others, and we are very confident in that profile. Yes. So let me just level set in relationship to clesrovimab, and the RSV antibody. So we have the data, and that data will be presented at some time in the second half of this year as the different plenary sessions of different conferences occur. In relationship to filing, our plan is to file such that it would be available, not for this season, but for the next season within the United States. And so that's the sort of next wave in relationship. So I want to make sure that there's no concept that this is coming out this RSV season. We're targeting next RSV season in relationship to when we're seeking approval and licensure. Yes. So this is Dean. Thank you very much for that. Neuroscience question for MK-8189. I should just point out that I believe it was just in May that we published the Phase IIa, and it shows its efficacy and relationship to schizophrenia. But what was also interesting was that there was a reduction in body weight of around 6 pounds over just 4 weeks. And the reason why that's important is that oftentimes, it's not simply how efficacious the drug is. It's whether a patient will stay on and what are the adverse effects that will drive a patient not to take the drug. So that Phase IIa was really important that triggered the Phase IIb. So I'll just lay out that if we see things that are comparable to that Phase IIa and our Phase IIb, we would be eager to see such results. So in relationship to our collaboration with Moderna in relationship to the INT [ph], that's something that we're focused on getting the Phase III fully enrolled and to move forward as that's really important in relationship to how we will see the program and how the FDA will see that program."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we delivered another excellent quarter, with growth driven by robust global demand across our innovative portfolio. These results are enabled by the excellent execution of our teams and reinforce the conviction we have in our science-led strategy. We remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results in the near-term, and are committed to making disciplined investments in compelling science to drive long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now, turning to our second quarter results. Total company revenues were $16.1 billion, an increase of 7%, or 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our Human Health business sustained its momentum with double-digit growth of 11% primarily driven by Oncology. Our Animal Health business also delivered solid performance, with sales increasing 6%, driven by growth in livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In Oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.3 billion driven by increased uptake from earlier stage cancers and continued strong global demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In the earlier-stage setting, the increase was largely attributable to uptake from KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091 in non-small cell lung cancer. KEYTRUDA has now achieved market leadership in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, building on its existing leadership position as adjuvant therapy. In metastatic disease, we saw continued strong uptake in first-line advanced urothelial cancer following the recent launch of KEYNOTE-A39. KEYTRUDA plus Padcev has now surpassed platinum chemotherapy-based regimens in new patient starts. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by increased use in certain earlier stage cancers, including high-risk, early-stage triple negative breast cancer and intermediate-high or high risk renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima each grew 4%. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $126 million driven by increased uptake in certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma. Our vaccines portfolio delivered solid growth. GARDASIL sales increased 4% to $2.5 billion. In the U.S., sales benefitted from price as well as demand and favorable CDC purchasing patterns. Outside the U.S., higher demand across many international markets was partially offset by the timing of shipments to China. In pneumococcal, VAXNEUVANCE sales increased 16% to $189 million. Growth was driven by ongoing launches in international markets. As Rob noted, we are very excited by the opportunity to positively impact the lives of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension following the recent U.S. launch of WINREVAIR. Recall, we received FDA approval on March 26th, with the first patients receiving therapy about one month later. Initial patient and physician feedback has been favorable, and we recorded $70 million of sales in the quarter. We estimate that approximately 40% of sales were attributable to doses administered to patients, with the remainder due to distributors building inventory in support of increasing demand. The launch is off to a strong start. As of the end of June, more than 2,000 patients received a prescription for WINREVAIR. Our experience to date with those prescriptions, would suggest that approximately 75% to 80% will receive commercial product. Of those, more than 1,000 patients started treatment in the quarter, largely reflecting prescriptions written in April and May, as it currently takes approximately one month to complete the steps necessary to commence therapy. More than 500 physicians have written at least one prescription, with many looking to gain experience with the product as they prioritize treating the most advanced patients, who are in greatest need of additional therapy. Most prescribers are from either large academic centers or larger private practices. We are pleased that payors are recognizing the value of WINREVAIR and are already providing access to patients. Many payors have established coverage policies consistent with the label or STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. In summary, we are pleased with the strong start and look forward to continued progress in enabling access for appropriate patients over the coming months. Our Animal Health business delivered another solid quarter, with sales increasing 6%. Livestock sales grew 11% driven by higher demand for poultry and ruminant products as well as price. Companion animal sales grew 1%, reflecting price partially offset by a reduction in distributor inventory. We are also excited to have launched a long-acting BRAVECTO injectable in a number of international markets during June. I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 80.9%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased to $6.2 billion. There were no significant business development expenses in the quarter, compared with a $10.2 billion charge a year ago. Excluding this charge, operating expenses grew 8%, reflecting strategic investments to realize the promise of our robust early- and late-phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $108 million. Our tax rate was 14.1%. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.28. Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The continued operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.4 and $64.4 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million at the midpoint. Our increased guidance range represents strong year over year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including an approximate 3 percentage point negative impact from foreign exchange using mid-July rates. Our gross margin assumption remains approximately 81%. We now expect operating expenses to be between $26.8 and $27.6 billion. This range reflects an incremental $1.5 billion of charges related to the one-time cost to acquire EyeBio and ongoing expenses to advance the assets, as well as investments to progress our innovative pipeline. As a reminder, our guidance does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other Expense is expected to be approximately $350 million, which now includes financing costs for the acquisitions of EyeBio and Elanco's aqua business. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be between 15.5% and 16.5%, which includes an unfavorable impact related to the EyeBio acquisition that is not tax-deductible. We assume approximately 2.54 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we expect EPS of $7.94 to $8.04. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30, using mid-July rates. Recall our prior guidance range was $8.53 to $8.65. Including the one-time charge of $1.3 billion, or $0.51 per share, related to the acquisition of EyeBio and an estimated $0.09 to advance the assets as well as finance the EyeBio and Elanco aqua business transactions, our prior guidance range would have been $7.93 to $8.05, with a midpoint of $7.99. Our current guidance midpoint remains the same as our higher revenue estimate is being offset by increased investments to support our business. As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. We look forward to the opportunity to help protect certain adults from invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia following the recent FDA approval and ACIP recommendation of CAPVAXIVE. We are now working toward the achievement of certain milestones that will enable commercial uptake. These milestones include publication in the morbidity and mortality weekly report, which typically lags an ACIP recommendation by a few months, as well as obtaining payor coverage and contracting with customers. For GARDASIL, over the past few years we've benefitted from extremely strong demand in China, including from the expanded indication for GARDASIL 9 to the 9 to 45 year age cohort in late 2022. In the second quarter however, there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. We are working closely with them to more fully understand the dynamics that caused this change. As we learn more, we will assess future shipments to our partner and work to bring their inventory back to more normal levels. If shipments from Zhifei into the points of vaccination do not increase it is likely that we will ship less than our full year 2024 contracted doses by the end of this year. We believe the opportunity in China remains very attractive as there are more than 120 million females in the addressable population living in Tier 1 to Tier 5 cities who have not yet received the protection of an HPV vaccine. As we said before, it will take increasing efforts to educate and activate the next wave of patients. Together with Zhifei, we are focused on and committed to investing in additional resources and patient education on the value of GARDASIL given the important benefits it provides. We also look forward to the potential approval for males which we believe represents a meaningful opportunity. More broadly, we remain confident in the opportunity for GARDASIL globally based on the protection it provides against HPV-related cancers and low immunization levels overall, and continue to believe we will achieve sales of over $11 billion by 2030. Our initial launch of WINREVAIR is having a positive impact for patients. We are very pleased with its performance and look forward to supporting more patients in the U.S. and across the globe. Outside the U.S., we are pleased with the positive CHMP opinion and potential near-term launch in Europe. Following EU approval, we will need to obtain reimbursement, which should occur in 2025 in most major markets, but expect that Germany will receive reimbursement and launch this year. We remain confident in the successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our high expectations, and look forward to providing further updates on our progress. Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our expansive pipeline of novel candidates, each of which has significant potential to address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend, and plan to increase it over time. Business development remains a priority and we are well positioned to pursue additional science-driven, value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases. To conclude, as we enter the second half of the year, there is continued strength in our business, driven by global demand and commercial execution. We remain confident in our outlook, driven by our unwavering commitment to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve the lives of patients. With investment in innovation and our ongoing focus on execution, we are well positioned to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. Thank you, Rob. So Chris, in terms of our guidance, we've assumed a range of scenarios from providing the fully contracted 2024 doses during this year to providing something less than that. If I anchor to the midpoint of our guidance, we have been measured in assuming a scenario that has less than the contracted 2024 GARDASIL doses shipped to China. And even with that, we were able to raise our guidance at the midpoint by $200 million. And that's really as a result of the underlying momentum that we have in the rest of our business, including oncology, with KEYTRUDA and WELIREG. It includes in animal health with the launch of BRAVECTO in injectable, as well as the acquisition of the Elanco aqua business, and we remain confident in our outlook for WINREVAIR and the opportunities to drive patient impact and growth consistent with our high expectations. So what I would add is we have always contemplated that we would have a 9-valent competitor within the Chinese market. As such, the current contracted doses with Zhifei for 2025 are less than what the contract is for 2024 as we would expect to participate in that market but understand a competitor would likely gain share in that market. We also, though, as we said in the prepared remarks, has the potential opportunity of a male launch in China. And we are hopeful for an approval with GARDASIL 4 and 9 by first half of next year and be coming to the market at that stage. So we are confident that China will remain an important part of our GARDASIL business as we move forward, and more importantly, are confident in the opportunity to drive GARDASIL longer term to the $11 billion that we've stated. Thank you for the question. So the Zhifei contract that we have at this stage is focused on the current approval that we have in the market. So it's really focused on the female population in the cohort 9 through 45. As we move forward and we have a male indication, we will, of course, be working with our partner to have the appropriate doses so that we can protect as many males as possible. So thank you for the question, Louise. We feel that we're off to a really strong start with WINREVAIR. As we've described, as at the end of the quarter, we have 2,000 patients who now have the prescription for WINREVAIR, of which 75% to 80% historically have been receiving commercial product. So we're confident in what we expect for the profile for WINREVAIR in the third quarter. And we actually expect that the stock level should increase as more patients have prescribed the product. So we remain confident in the outlook for WINREVAIR consistent with the high expectations that we have."

            "name": "Rob Davis",
            "content": "Thanks Peter. Good morning. And thank you for joining today's call. Our business is demonstrating strong momentum as we exit the first half of the year. We remain guided by our purpose of harnessing the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. Our ambitious and dedicated teams are working tirelessly to reach more patients with our broad commercial portfolio and advance our deep pipeline with the goal of delivering future innovations that solve for additional unmet medical needs. Through excellent scientific, commercial and operational execution, we're achieving significant milestones for our company and for patients. This quarter, we're proud to have successfully launched WINREVAIR, which has introduced a novel mechanism to treat adults suffering with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We're also pleased by the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE, the first approved pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults, as well as the subsequent ACIP recommendation. Both of these important innovations demonstrate our unwavering commitment to creating value for patients and shareholders. And we remain committed to the execution of strategic business development to further augment our pipeline. We recently announced and have now closed the acquisition of EyeBio, which expands our effort in ophthalmology and brings to Merck a novel, late-phase candidate for the treatment of retinal diseases. This promising new mechanism adds another substantial potential commercial opportunity to our expanding pipeline in an area of significant unmet medical need. In addition, our Animal Health business closed the acquisition of Elanco's aqua business, which establishes Merck as a leader in this important production animal category. 3 years ago, I was honored to step into the role of CEO, and it remains my top priority to uphold and build on Merck's legacy as a premier science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company. At that time, I affirmed Merck's strategic commitment to the research and development of innovative medicines and vaccines as the source of long-term value creation. I communicated our intention to be appropriately aggressive in making the necessary investments to both advance our broad internal pipeline and augment it with the best external science through business development. Since then, we've made substantial progress in expanding and evolving our pipeline to the benefit of future patients. We have the potential to bring as many new drugs to market in the next 5 years as we launched over the last 10 years, across a greater number of therapeutic areas and modalities, and with a significant proportion having blockbuster-plus potential. We've made tremendous progress building on our past successes, enabling the creation of a sustainable engine that will drive future innovations for patients. And we continue to leverage our scientific prowess to identify new therapeutic targets where we can add value through our expertise in clinical development and regulatory affairs, and our global commercial scale. I'm also proud of the substantial improvements we've made across our sustainability focus areas. We're reaching more people with our medicines and vaccines across a greater number of countries globally than ever before, and doing so with a dedicated, highly talented and diverse employee base. Finally, we're driving increased innovation and productivity through widespread integration of data, digital and analytics in all areas of our business. Going forward, I'm committed to ensuring our actions remain aligned with our strategy, and I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver value to patients and shareholders long into the future. Turning to our second quarter results, we achieved strong growth, reflecting continued demand across our broad portfolio, which is reflected in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in just a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts and new launches. In cardiometabolic, we've seen very favorable reception by physicians, patients and payors to the availability of WINREVAIR. While still early, the U.S. launch has gone very well, in line with our own high expectations. We've deployed a focused, customer-centric rare disease model and are pleased to see an increasing number of prescriptions being written and patients obtaining access. We've also received a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to potential regulatory approval in Europe in the near future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of patients living with this devastating disease. In vaccines, we continue to bring forward innovations for both adults and children. We are proud of the recent FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, and the unanimous ACIP recommendation. Given its compelling clinical profile, we expect that CAPVAXIVE will achieve a majority market share in the adult setting. We were also pleased to announce positive topline results from the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of clesrovimab, our investigational monoclonal antibody for the prevention of RSV in infants, and we are moving swiftly to bring this important option to market. Finally, at our ASCO investor event, we highlighted the significant broadening of our oncology pipeline and the progress we've made in building on the success of KEYTRUDA. We presented data for multiple novel candidates, demonstrating our commitment to advancing standards of care and maintaining leadership over the long term. As a company, we remain highly focused and continue to work with urgency to bring forward these innovations, and others, for the patients we serve. In summary, I want to again recognize the tremendous efforts of our global team. Together, we've made significant progress across our diverse pipeline and portfolio. As a company, we've been advancing science for the benefit of patients for over 130 years, and I'm confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question. And I'll maybe take the first part and then ask Caroline to comment on guidance. To your question, China represents about for GARDASIL about 60% to 70% of the numbers. So that kind of gives you a sense of it. But maybe to give some context on what we saw in the quarter and as we look to the full year and where we see things going. So let me start maybe by talking a little bit about the dynamics. The opportunity that exists for GARDASIL in China remains very attractive with more than 120 million eligible females in China yet to be protected against HPV, which represents about 60% to 70% of the eligible population. And I think we all recognize the benefits of protection against HPV-related diseases is clear and importantly, aligns with China's Healthy 2030 initiative. So the underlying support, we continue to believe is there. In addition, we have filed for the male indication, which has been accepted and represents another significant opportunity. So as we think about China, I just want to set the context because I think it's important to understand, we continue to have a very meaningful opportunity in the China market. What's unclear to us and what we're trying to understand is that during the second quarter, we saw a significant step down in shipments from Zhifei [ph] to the points of vaccination. The reductions during the second quarter was surprising, and I would point out was a meaningful departure from prior trends we've seen both throughout really all of 2023 and into the first quarter of 2024. So as we look at this, we're wanting to understand what would cause the trend break we saw. And I can tell you what we know as of now is we believe there could be multiple factors that may be contributing to this dynamic, and we're working closely with our partner to try to tease out what exactly is happening. But overall, the data we track indicates that the whole HPV market in China experienced this step down. So this is not a Merck-specific event. And importantly, we see the market share for GARDASIL as stable or actually increasing right now in the marketplace. We don't believe this step down, therefore, represents any change in the competitive dynamic and GARDASIL remains by far the market leader. We do believe, however, that based on the intelligence we've gathered, activity in the HPV vaccine area has been recently impacted by China's anti-bribery and anticorruption drive, which, as you know, started really last year. And up to that point, we really haven't seen much impact, but we do believe we are starting to see it now. And this is really driven by the fact that in the health care industry, there has been as a result of this, a reduction in scientific engagement, primarily in the CDC within China and fewer immunizations. So we need to tease that out more. And in addition, we did see reduced levels of promotional support for HPV vaccination at the same time that our distribution partner, Zhifei [ph] broadened its portfolio. So we'll need to get more into that. But obviously, we have a very strong relationship with Zhifei, and we already have started to put in place a robust plan to invest in increased promotional efforts really designed to drive awareness, education and activation of the remaining female opportunity, and this includes both resources at Zhifei and more selling resources and promotional resources as well as promotional resources being deployed directly from Merck. So as we look forward, we will have to see how all of these activities impact shipments to the point of vaccination. And as we learn more, we'll assess future shipments to China with our partner. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of what we're seeing, but I just would reiterate one other point. And that's -- that as we look to the long term, given both the opportunity in China, I mentioned for the 120 million remaining females as well as the potential for the male indication, outside of China, we saw double-digit growth across all regions in the quarter. So we continue to be on track, doing well and driving growth in this important vaccine. And that's why you heard Caroline in our prepared comments reiterate our confidence in the $11 billion number by 2030, even taking into account what we saw China happening - in China this quarter. So with that, maybe I'll turn it over to Caroline and she can address your guidance specific question. Caroline? Yes. No, thanks for the question. So everything we're seeing in the marketplace, I would just reiterate, would point to dynamics that we don't see the competition, the future potential competition. And I think you're referring to the fact that we very well could see a 9-valent sometime next year come into the marketplace. So I don't believe from anything we've heard in the marketplace from competitive intelligence as well as what we're hearing from Zhifei that, that is what's happening here. As we look forward, and Caroline can comment specifically, we have always expected that as we see the peak move through from the indication we got for the expansion of the age cohort that you would see a flattening out over time of the demand in China. And then that for women, specifically, and then we would bring on the male indications that should allow us then to continue to drive the business forward from there. Nothing has changed in that dynamic in what we're seeing right now. So as we look forward, our belief in China being a significant contributor is unchanged. But I'll let maybe Caroline can speak specifically as we're thinking about some of the guidance around how we think about next year. Yes. And maybe, Umer, just to give one little bit of color because it's probably worth pointing out, I'm assuming people understand when we talk about the anti-bribery and anticorruption what is happening. And one question that could be there is this has been going on since late last year, and we did not see impacts early on, what's changed and how do we see it evolving. And what I would point out, first of all, one, just reiterate, as we think about what's happening in China around the anti-bribery and anticorruption we very much support those activities because it means we have a fair, open and transparent market. So we're very supportive of what the Chinese government is trying to do there. But as we see how this is impacting us at the CDC, we have seen some dampening in them engaging in scientific discussions and driving for vaccination. We believe some of this could be due to the fact that there was criminal charges brought against a senior scientific representative of one of the local players related to a COVID vaccine that we believe has had a dampening effect overall. And how long this lasts, how it will continue to play out, we'll have to see. But I thought I would provide additional color because I don't want to assume that you all are aware of what really is happening there. Yes. No, thanks for the question. So to give you a sense of what we've seen as of the end of June, we've had more than 2,000 patients receive a prescription for WINREVAIR. So that's -- obviously, we feel very good about that. And right now, what our experience would tell us is that about 75% to 80% of those receiving a prescription will convert to commercial product. So that gives you a sense of what's happening. Right now, actually, in the quarter, driving the revenue you saw was about 30 -- about 1,000 patients actually on treatment had started treatment. So as we sit here today, you have 1,000 patients who have started treatment in the quarter, the 2,000 total scripts, and we would expect that the 75% to 80% of those 2,000 scripts will ultimately convert to the commercial sales. And so if you look at what's driving that difference, some of that is due to access, but also some of it is due to patient dropout and the fact that you will have some patients who despite getting a script after they go through blood [ph] work and go through the medical evaluations don't qualify. So you have all of those dynamics happening. If you look at the 30 days and specifically that you're referring to, we think that probably the total period from when a person gets a script to when they get their approval for -- from an access perspective is about 2 weeks to 3 weeks. So there is obviously opportunity to improve that. But just remember that in addition to going and getting a blood test, getting your insurance approval, you then have to schedule to have a nurse come to your home to go through the initiation and training around administration -- self-administration of WINREVAIR. So all of those elements are contributing to that time frame, how much of that time over time we'll have to see. Yes, sure. So as we look at it, we do expect you will see a flattening of the curve as we see the female indication, be more fully penetrated. Obviously, more to go there, given what we believe is still the addressable population. And then it will ramp back to growth as the male population comes on in full. So that is what we're expecting to happen. And on the pricing point, I think it's just important to understand the way this market works and how we operate in the market. We sell into Zhifei, Zhifei then is responsible for doing the bidding with the provinces and actually then determining ultimately that end sale to the point of vaccination. As we look forward, I think it's important to understand that GARDASIL as we think about the addressable population, we continue to believe we'll be a highly sought after vaccine even in the face of competition, and we're dealing in an overall population when we quote the $200 million total females of which we would say we're 30% to 40% penetrated today. That's really in the Tier 1 to 5 cities that we think can afford a cash pay market. The total population accessible in China is much bigger and so I don't think we should assume we're all competing for that small slice. There's a much bigger slice. We have chosen not to go for that bigger piece because obviously, we can't get into the local vaccination program because we don't produce GARDASIL in China. Our competitors will be able to do that. So I think I would just caution all to not view it as a zero-sum game. I think there's still a market expansion opportunity in China that will benefit both us and the competitors. And frankly, the other thing we have to see is how quickly will the male indication be given to others beyond us. We believe there's a chance we could be sitting alone with that as well. So the dynamics need to play themselves out. But I think we need to first understand what we're seeing in the quarter specific, a short-term event or something else. And that's still not clear because I would just point that the trend break was pretty significant. It's not what we've seen in any of the markets that you would expect. And that's why we're a little hesitant to say this is just demand in China. And also, I would also bring back the fact that actually, if you separated out what happened in China, we had one of our strongest quarters in every other market around the world with strong double-digit growth. So that's -- those are all dynamics that we'll have to play themselves out. Yes. So if you look across the Tier 1 to 5 cities, we're actually -- when we quote that we're 30% to 40% penetrated, and again, this is just to the females. So this is -- we're only speaking to females right now. We're 30% to 40% penetrated. We're a little bit less penetrated, I think we're around kind of, say, 30th percent in the 4 and 5 Tier cities, and we're around 40% into 1 to 3. So there's not a huge spread between the Tier 1 to 3 and the 4 to 5. So we will continue to focus efforts across all of those areas as we have been to date. And then it's a whole different exercise to activate the male population across that same area, which is, frankly, doesn't -- isn't there today because of the fact that we don't yet have the indication. As you think about how all of this fits into the broader global picture, I think it's also important just to remind everyone that the total penetration of GARDASIL on a global basis to the eligible population is approximately 10%. So our opportunity to activate patients globally as we bring on additional capacity is significant. And as we've talked about in the past, we were going to continue to look to activate the mid adult segment in the private market. We're doing that today in Europe, and that's part of when I comment that we're driving double-digit growth across the rest of the world outside of China. Part of it is we are starting to see uptake in that private market activation, both in Europe and across parts of Latin America and Asia Pacific more broadly. We're going to continue to drive into the low and middle income markets, we see that as a meaningful opportunity going forward, and we are well on our way to getting our costs in a position to be able to compete in that space quite effectively. We will continue to drive that. And then obviously, while China is the best example of where we need to get a male indication to drive for gender-neutral vaccination if we truly want to eliminate cervical cancer and increasingly address the other cancers we know related to people with HPV, including head and neck cancers, which are very prominent, especially if you look across the Asia Pacific area. That is work we will continue to do, but not only in China and across Asia but also across Europe and other parts of the world where there still is a lot of opportunity to drive for gender neutral. And then lastly, Japan is a market where we are continuing to see growth driven by the fact that we've had a renewed NIP program there with both initial NIP and a catch-up phase and longer term opportunities for males there as well. So the opportunities are significant. The context of how we will drive growth has multiple levers for us to look at to do that. And that's why we are confident in the $11 billion number long term. And I think that's important as we shape the overall context of the discussion. Yes. And maybe just on the broader question, could this be an opportunity in China. We are continuing to look at all global markets. And I would point out, as Dean points out, we're looking at the '25, '26 RSV season, so next year. And then beyond that, we will go globally thereafter. And China is a market we are looking at. Thank you very much. So just to provide some context, the recent outcome talked about how much of a PD-1 or a PD-L1 is put in earlier stage, especially in the resectable and there's giving it before the surgery, there's giving it after the surgery, and it's giving it before and after the surgery. And the issue that comes up is in this curative setting, what's the sort of relative benefit risk in, because it's different than in the metastatic. What I would just emphasize is we track and we are in discussions with the FDA in relationship to our clinical trials and such. But I do want to emphasize the ability to show OS especially in the earlier-stage cancers is very difficult. And that's why we always emphasize we have 9 earlier-stage approvals, but we highlight that 4 of them have overall survival, and we, at this point, do not know anyone else who has 4 overall survivals. I do want to point out that in 2 of those over survivals in TNBC and in lung, it is perioperative. So I think the future studies need to consider what the FDA has said, but the FDA has also been very clear that over survival is the gold standard, especially an earlier stage. And as we build our program, we consider both the recent AdCom, but also the recent -- with the continuing interest of the FDA to show contribution of components of a new agent on top of PD-1 and showing overall survival and using platforms that have overall survival to show that when you add something even more, you continue to have increasing benefit in terms of over survival. Thank you so much for bringing that up. There was a lot of discussion. There were a lot of points that the ACIP working group have to vote on. And what they had said is that they were very interested in revisiting this in October. I want to be very clear that we have not had a formal confirmation of that reevaluation. But we did listen to the discussion. And the discussion was very clear that there was an interest in revisiting that in 50 to 64. And the data presented at the June ACIP meeting demonstrated or actually reinforced the ongoing burden of pneumococcal disease, especially in the 50-64 age group, most notably in the ratio of disparities. And I went back to the comments that were made by different individuals, but I focused on some of the points that those who actually vote in the ACIP, one resonated with me when that member said, the burden in 50 to 64-year-old black individuals is comparable to greater than 65 when we're all endorsing universal recommendation for over 65. And that member wondered whether we, which is the ACIP, was missing something too, by not deciding, and that we, the ACIP needed to decide at some point, and I hope we get there pretty soon in part because of the racial and ethnic disparities in the invasive disease. So we are very confident in our data, and we look forward to the ACIP considering this expanded age-based recommendation potentially in October, and we hope to find out at some appropriate time that they're going to formally confirm that reevaluation. Yes. No, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, we discussed what we did in the quarter with EyeBio and Elanco aqua business, we're going to continue to follow the same strategy we've been looking at, which is really focusing on the science and looking at how can we best continue to drive where we see a scientific opportunity that matches our portfolio and our skill set to bring that in more on the earlier stage settings and with some mid late but clearly not commercialized products more to build the pipeline. So the continuation of the strategy we've been following. We continue to have the financial flexibility to consider deals of all sizes. But as we've pointed out in the past, we tend to look in that $1 billion to $15 billion, is a good indication of where we would most likely play. And to the obesity question specifically, our view continues to be that if we can find opportunities to look at next-generation plays in that space, those will be things we will continue to evaluate and consider. We don't believe going after today's first generation is the place to play. So it will continue to be looking at second and third generation waves of innovation, whether it be around oral delivery, looking for where there's high tolerability, combinability and or preservation of muscle mass. Those are the areas of focus for us. And if we see something, we continue to have the capacity and the interest to act. Yes. Maybe I'll start on the second part and then I'll come back to the first part. So on background therapy, you are seeing the vast majority of patients, as you would expect, are some of the sicker patients or who doctors are putting on the drug first. So there is a large amount on triple therapy or double therapy, and you are seeing uses with prostacyclin. So that is and frankly, consistent with what you would have seen in STELLAR as well. So we are seeing that pretty much as you'd expect. And then over time, we would expect to move into the earlier lines of therapy as we go. As it relates to what we see going forward with the bolus, I would say that we're -- it's not necessary that we think the bolus has been worked through. There's what I would tell you more broadly is we're seeing a continued growth in both the breadth and the depth of prescribers who are prescribing, which were at a little over 500 doctors now prescribing. We think there's probably somewhere in the 800 to 900 range of doctors that are doing the vast majority of prescribing out there. So we still have a ways to go to get to what I would consider to be heavy prescribers of the medicine. And as we see that group continuing to come in and as we continue to see access being granted because the other thing I would point out that, one, we feel very good. We have about a third of all lives are covered today under medical plan with a protocol in place for reimbursement related to WINREVAIR. We expect that to continue to grow because I would remind you that a lot of plans actually put in place just by the rule that they will wait 90 to 120 days-ish to put in place a plan -- a coverage plan after a drug is launched. So you have a lot of plans still yet to come. So because of the fact you're going to see increasing access, you're going to see the fact that we have increasing number of physicians, and we're continuing to see the breadth of patients grow, I think you're going to see continued trend for growth upward. So the answer to your first question is yes. And the answer to the second question, I would let Dean address. No. No. I just want to thank you for your interest this morning. Hopefully, you appreciate the transparency with which we try to bring. But I maybe would close by just bringing back the confidence we see in the business, both in the short term and the long term. Obviously, we'll work through what we see happening with GARDASIL in China. But the fact that we see strengthening, and I would call them, green shoots around GARDASIL everywhere else in the world gives us confidence in the $11 billion for that, as we've talked about. But then beyond that, the growing breadth of our pipeline, obviously, KEYTRUDA continues to deliver meaningfully for the business and for patients. But I am growing in my own excitement for the breadth and depth of the pipeline we have coming. Hopefully, it wasn't lost on everyone that we pointed out, we would be launching more drugs in the next 5 years than we've launched in the last 10 many, many of which will be blockbuster plus opportunities. So the pipeline is maturing, and we're starting to see the green shoots of opportunity that continue to grow our confidence as we look to 2028 into the 2030s and beyond. And that's where we will continue to focus. But we will not take our eye off the short term where we are equally confident in the guidance, we raised revenue today. Obviously, we kind of were neutral on earnings, but that's because of the investment we're making into the business, bringing in even more opportunities like EyeBio. So there's a lot out there, and I just want to leave you with that note of what's driving my confidence and my appreciation for your support of the stock. Thank you."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Dannenbaum, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Shirley, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Speaking on today's call will be Rob Davis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Caroline Litchfield, Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Dean Li, President of Merck Research Labs.\n Before we get started, I'd like to point out a few items. You will see that we have items in our GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that we have excluded these from our non-GAAP results and provide a reconciliation in our press release.\n I would like to remind you that some of the statements that we make today may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provision of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are made based on the current beliefs of Merck's management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. If our underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\n Our SEC filings, including Item 1A and the 2023 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any of our forward-looking statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.\n During today's call, a slide presentation will accompany our speakers' prepared remarks. These slides, along with our earnings release, today's prepared remarks and our SEC filings, are all posted to the Investor Relations section of Merck's website.\n With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob. \nRobert Davis: Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We've begun 2024 with continuing momentum in our business. We're harnessing the power of innovation to advance our deep pipeline and are maximizing the impact of our broad commercial portfolio for the benefit of patients. We drove strong growth across key therapeutic areas, executed strategic business development and are now launching a significant new product in the cardiometabolic space while also preparing for the potential approval and launch of 2 additional important candidates in vaccines in oncology. We have significant opportunities ahead of us across all areas of our business, and we're highly focused on realizing them. \n I continue to be inspired by the dedication of our talented global team, which is working tirelessly to bring differentiated medicines and vaccines to patients through seamless scientific, commercial and operational execution. In March, we received FDA approval for WINREVAIR, a first-in-class treatment for adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease. This marks the achievement of a significant milestone for our company. It exemplifies the value of our strategic priorities and demonstrates how our enduring commitment to our purpose is resulting in tangible benefits for patients. \n Just over 2 years since adding WINREVAIR to our pipeline, our attention now turns to the execution of a strong commercial launch where we have already seen prescriptions being written. We see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of people living with PAH. And further, the importance of this therapy to patients provides us with increased confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Strategic business development focused on the best external science remains an important priority for our company. We've demonstrated that we can leverage our deep discovery prowess to identify important acquisition targets and then add significant value through our powerful clinical research engine, our regulatory expertise and our commercial scale, which together can serve to accelerate development and enable broad global access to important medical discoveries for patients in need. \n Turning to our first quarter results. We achieved strong growth, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. We're pleased to reflect this momentum in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts. We're focused on advancing our expansive and diverse pipeline of leading-edge programs for the benefit of patients. In vaccines, we continue to pioneer new approaches to optimize disease prevention. In HPV, we're building on the foundation set by GARDASIL to further reduce the global burden of certain HPV-related cancers and disease by potentially providing broader protection with a new multivalent HPV vaccine and by generating data to clearly demonstrate whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved 3-dose regimen in males and females ages 16 to 26. \n In pneumococcal, we presented additional compelling data for V116, a vaccine that is specifically designed to help protect against the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older and look forward to its potential approval in June. Each of these programs are platforms where we can provide meaningful protection to broad populations on a global scale. In HIV, in partnership with Gilead, we shared promising data from our revitalized program for a once-weekly combination of islatravir and lenacapavir in the treatment setting. We're actively progressing our comprehensive clinical program, which is focused on both treatment and prevention strategies to meet the evolving needs of the HIV community. \n And in oncology, we initiated several late-stage programs of novel candidates from our diverse pipeline as we work to expand our impact for patients and reinforce our leadership position over the long term. Finally, across our deep pipeline, we have significant clinical momentum in a range of therapeutic areas. Cutting-edge science is at the core of who we are, and I'm confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver the next wave of important innovations and value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders.\n In summary, our science-led strategy is delivering compelling proof points that we are creating a sustainable innovation engine that with continued clinical success will lead to a more diversified portfolio of growth drivers over the next decade and beyond. I again want to recognize the enormous efforts across our global organization. My confidence is strong and growing, that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. \nCaroline Litchfield: Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we have had a strong start to the year with robust growth across our business, which reinforces the confidence we have in our outlook. We are also making strategic investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world, positioning us to continue to deliver long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $15.8 billion, an increase of 9% or 12% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The impact from exchange is primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice. \n The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its momentum with double-digit growth of 13%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% across both companion animal and livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $6.9 billion, driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued strong demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In earlier-stage cancers, the increase was largely attributable to non-small cell lung cancer following the launches of KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091.\n In the metastatic setting, we saw strong uptake from the recent launch of KEYNOTE A39 in first-line advanced urothelial cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by continued uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 7% and 10%, respectively. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $85 million, driven by the additional indication following FDA approval of LITESPARK-005 for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma as well as by increased uptake in certain VHL disease-associated tumors.\n Our vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by global demand. Sales also benefited from the timing of shipments in China and CDC purchasing patterns in the U.S. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $219 million, driven by continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. and ongoing launches in international markets, particularly in Europe. In the U.S., VAXNEUVANCE sales also benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 4%. Livestock sales growth was driven by price actions as well as demand for swine and poultry products. Companion animal growth reflects price actions.\n I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 81.2%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL, which went into effect at the beginning of this year as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $6.4 billion, a charge of $656 million related to the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics this quarter was lower than the $1.4 billion of charges a year ago for certain business development transactions. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 8%.\n We remain committed to investing appropriately to realize the promise of our expensive early and late phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $87 million. Our tax rate was 16.1%, including the impact from the Harpoon transaction for which no tax benefit was recorded. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.07, which includes a $0.26 negative impact from the charge related to Harpoon.\n Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.1 million and $64.3 billion, reflecting strong year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including the negative impact from foreign exchange. At the midpoint of this range, operational strength in our business of approximately $600 million is partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $400 million using mid-April rates resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 3%.\n Our gross margin assumption is now expected to be approximately 81%. Our estimated range of operating expenses is between $25.2 million and $26.1 billion, which does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $250 million. Our full year tax rate is unchanged between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $8.53 to $8.65. This is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint despite an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05 using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30.\n As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. The increase in our sales guidance is driven by the strong performance across our current product portfolio, led by KEYTRUDA, which continues to experience growth from additional indications and patient demand. For GARDASIL, second quarter ex U.S. growth will be adversely impacted by shipment timing to China. This year, we expect more evenly distributed quarterly shipments to China. Recall, in 2023, we accelerated shipments from the second half to the first half of the year, which primarily impacted the second quarter. Over the near and long term, we remain confident in our ability to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers and drive growth of GARDASIL.\n Sales of LAGEVRIO in the first quarter were driven by an extended wave of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific markets. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important treatment option for certain patients with COVID-19. So we continue to anticipate full year sales to be lower than last year. We are excited to provide a novel treatment option for adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, following the recent FDA approval of WINREVAIR. We are seeing high interest from patient groups and a range of relevant prescribers. We are also making good progress in enabling access.\n Several payers have already established coverage policies consistent with the label and STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. As we go forward, we intend to provide an appropriate level of transparency to enable insight into the impact we are having on patients, including prescription data and revenues. In summary, we are confident in a successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress. \n Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our innovative pipeline, including the initiation of many new late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has the potential to meaningfully address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Adding compelling science to our pipeline through business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases.\n To conclude, we remain confident in the near- and long-term outlook of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines as well as our exceptional pipeline. Our unwavering commitment to use the power of cutting-edge science to improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our excellent execution and continued investments in innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. \nDean Li: Thank you, Caroline. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress with a steady cadence of clinical regulatory milestones across our pipeline. Today, I will provide updates from our cardiometabolic disease portfolio, HIV and vaccine programs and close with advances in our oncology pipeline. As Rob and Caroline noted, late last month, we received approval from the FDA for WINREVAIR, our first-in-class active and signaling inhibitor for the treatment of dose living with pulmonary arterial hypertension to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. \n WINREVAIR is a novel therapeutic option that targets a new PAH treatment pathway and is indicated to treat a broad PAH population. This approval marks a significant step towards our goal of transforming the treatment journey for many patients with PAH. WINREVAIR is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency with a decision anticipated in the second half of this year. The Phase III ZENITH and Hyperion studies evaluating patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on in their disease journey, respectively, are ongoing as well as the Phase II cadence trial evaluating WHO Group II pulmonary hypertension, a type of left heart disease.\n Our commitment extends to a broad range of pulmonary hypertension, informed by results from the Phase II cohort of the Phase II/III insignia PAH study evaluating MK-5475, our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator and the STELLAR trial results for WINREVAIR, we have made the decision to focus the development of MK-5475 on WHO Group 3.1 pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD, and not further proceed in PAH. PH-COPD is an area of significant need with no specific therapies currently approved. Our HIV pipeline continues to advance. Last month, presentations at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, reinforce progress in our strategy to develop less frequent dosing regimens for managing and treating HIV.\n We believe these programs have the potential to help address adherence, stigma and other challenges faced by some individuals taking daily antiretroviral pills. In collaboration with Gilead, safety and efficacy findings were presented from a Phase II study evaluating a once-weekly oral combination of islatravir, an investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor and lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor for the treatment of adults living with HIV. At 24 weeks, the trial met its primary endpoint and in a secondary endpoint maintained a high rate of viral suppression. Additional longer-term data will be presented at a later date.\n In addition, safety and tolerability data were presented for MK-8527 a novel oral NRTTI candidates from 2 Phase I trials that evaluated ascending single dose and multiple doses in adults 18 to 55 years old, not infected with HIV. MK-8527 is being investigated as a potential monthly option for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Vaccines remain an important element of our pipeline, and we are making progress across several programs. Findings from multiple Phase III trials of V116, our investigational 21 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were presented at the meeting of the International Society of pneumonia and Pneumococcal Diseases last month. V116 was shown to be immunogenic for all 21 serotypes covered by the vaccine, including a pneumococcal vaccine naive and vaccine experience adults as well as those at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of serotypes that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in adults, ages 65 and older.\n The target action date is June 17. The meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on immunization practices is scheduled shortly thereafter. Since the initial approval of GARDASIL, a steady flow of clinical and real-world evidence has been generated to support the favorable efficacy, effectiveness, safety and long-term durability of protection against certain human papillomavirus-related cancers and diseases in both males and females. Despite the proven public health benefit of HPV vaccination, the latest global cancer statistics from the International Agency for Research on Cancer indicate there is more to do to help increase vaccination rates.\n The latest statistics from 2022 ranked cervical cancer as the fourth most common cancer globally in terms of incidents and mortality in women and the leading cause of cancer death in 37 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia regions. At the Urogen Congress, last month, we disclosed plans to build on the development of GARDASIL with a new clinical program to identify a novel multivalent HPV vaccine candidate with the potential to extend protection against a broader array of HPV types. This includes several types known to disproportionately impact African and Asian populations and individuals of African and Asian descent. First-in-human studies are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of this year.\n In addition, we announced plans to conduct 2 randomized, double-blind multiyear clinical trials in females and males ages 16 to 26 years to examine the short- and long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose of GARDASIL-9 versus the currently approved 3-dose regimen. The goal of these studies is to generate data that clearly demonstrates whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved regimen, while also satisfying the high standards required by regulatory authorities. The clinical trials are anticipated to start enrolling in the fourth quarter.\n In oncology, we continue to focus on our 3-pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting agents. In immuno-oncology, September 2024 will mark a decade since the first approval of KEYTRUDA in metastatic melanoma. KEYTRUDA has since amassed approvals for 39 indication and continues to reinforce its reputation as a foundational therapy for certain types of cancer. Building on the recent FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014, Stage II through IVA cervical cancer, we recently announced that the pivotal KEYNOTE-A18 trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival, potentially providing a new standard of care for these patients. Our commitment to providing better options to prevent and treat cervical cancer remain strong. Also, in women's cancer, the Phase III KEYNOTE-868 trial, known as NRG-GY018 was granted priority review by the FDA for the first-line treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This agency has set a target action date of June 21.\n Outside of the U.S., the European Commission approved KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-671 study. This marks the first approval in Europe for an anti-PD-1 PD-L1 therapy as part of a treatment regimen for the neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on positive overall survival results.\n Next to precision targeting. Building on the success of KEYTRUDA for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, earlier this month, we announced the initiation of the Phase III clinical trial for MK-1084, an investigational oral selective KRAS G12C inhibitor in combination with KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of certain patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The decision to proceed to Phase III was based upon early promising evidence from a Phase I study showing antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile. KRAS is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in human cancers, and G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n In the tissue targeting space, we are moving with speed and rigor to advance a broad pipeline of antibody drug conjugates with multiple planned and ongoing Phase III trials. In just over 6 months, we have made remarkable progress in our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Recently, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase II/III REJOICE OVARIAN01 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational CDH6 directed DXDADC in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We are poised to begin a Phase III study evaluating ifinatamab/deruxtecan, a B7-H3-directed ADC in small cell lung cancer, a notably difficult-to-treat tumor type. New treatment options are desperately needed for these patients where the prognosis remains poor.\n We are pleased to have recently completed the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which provides novel T cell engagers, including MK-6070, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager, also being evaluated in certain types of small cell lung cancer as well as neuroendocrine tumors.\n Finally, please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 3, where we will host an investor event at ASCO in Chicago and provide an update on our diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology, precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents.\n Looking forward, June promises to be a busy month with 3 regulatory action dates, including V116 for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. KEYTRUDA for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma; and patritumab/deruxtecan for advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\n We continue to execute on our strategy with a focus on operational excellence and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year.\n And now I will turn the call back to Peter. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Thank you, Dean. Surely, we're ready to begin Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: This is probably one for Dean. Obviously, you guys have been focused on building out your cardiometabolic franchise now. You have the sotatercept launch underway. You've got an oral PCSK9 in late-stage development. You have a GLP glucagon also moving forward for NASH, I believe. But I guess I'd just be curious how you think about the opportunity in obesity broadly as, on one hand, it seems like it could align with your current footprint. But on the other hand, it seems like Merck has gone more towards specialty markets and away from kind of primary care. So maybe just would love your thoughts there, Dean, as you think about building out. \nDean Li: Well, thank you very much. Yes, we are excited about the build-out that we have in cardiovascular metabolic. You pointed out the programs that have the most visibility right now. But let me assure you, there will be other programs that you will have more visibility over the coming years.\n In relationship to your question about GLP and obesity, I think there's 2 ways to look at it: you can look at it from a GLP angle, and you can look at it from an obesity angle. If you look at it from a GLP angle, there has been really important work showing its impact in diabetes, weight loss, more recently, in cardiovascular outcomes, most recently in sleep apnea.\n And you're right, we're very interested in relationship to MASH. We think that's an also important outcome. And we also think that there will be distinct populations, whether you call it obese or whether you call it NASH or -- within that GLP space. With distinct relations, it will be important to give a benefit of a molecule that really takes care of the primary concern. And that's our play, for example, in NASH, where we think we have a very tolerable drug that has significant reduction in liver fat and also gives a weight loss of 10% to 12%.\n When you look at that, I think these different outcomes may need different molecules. More generally, if you're talking about obesity, I do think that there's important work going on right now. But I think that there could be another wave where people start thinking about orals, how tolerable they are, the accessibility they are, combinations, how do you maintain, how you preserve muscle and also additional outcomes. And it may not be that the same molecule is the best molecule that wins out in every one of those sub populations. And so I would just -- I wonder if there will be some fractionation of the patient population when you say the word, for example, generally, obesity. And we wonder if there's opportunity there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: I wanted to touch on some of your work in lung cancer, specifically with KRAS G12C, echoing Dean's comment. So this space is becoming increasingly crowded. Maybe walk me through what you believe differentiates your assets today from the currently approved one or from the pan-KRAS assets in development. \nDean Li: Yes. So this is one of my more favorite projects. So I appreciate that you actually ask a question about it. When you look at KRAS, as you point out, there is -- it's one of the most important driver mutations in multiple cancers. And if you say more broadly, not KRAS but pan-RAS, that is also true.\n In relationship to KRAS G12C, that's a small percentage of all the KRAS mutations and all the RAS mutations. But where KRAS G12C is especially prominent is in non-small cell lung cancer. It's, depending on the percentage, 12% to 15% in that patient population.\n And I will also emphasize that we have a lot of data in relationship to that patient population in non-small cell lung cancer. It's KEYNOTE-189. It's chemo plus IO. You need a potent compound with a KRAS to move it into first line. That's the game that we're trying to play. So it is crowded. But what you're looking for is a potent compound that has tremendous monotherapy efficacy. But most importantly, when you combine it with, for example, pembro, you maintain the dose, you maintain the ability to not have dose modifications. And that's the data that made us excited about this because I think we reported an ORR of 71% in combination. So that's why we're advancing that.\n The race for us is to get it in first line and then to think about other KRAS indications and IO-sensitive/insensitive and also other molecules that are coming through in the lung cancer space. And some of them are related to antibody drug conjugate. So we are very excited about our KRAS G12C program, 1084, which is moving to Phase III. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. \nChris Shibutani: Maybe focusing on the pipeline on areas that you do not highlight as often, specifically immunology. And then a lot of the discovery work that you talk about in CNS. With immunology with a TL1A, can you just help us understand where we are on the Crohn's study there and also the Pandion acquisition, like in just Phase II.\n And then CNS, you highlight how many folks you have doing discovery research. How do you feel about the distribution of your efforts in CNS there? So just 2 areas not highlighted in the press release, but I think are important to your overall portfolio. \nDean Li: Thank you very much. So I'll first touch immunology and specifically in the TL1A space. So that TL1A, we think that it will be a highly effective -- the higher efficacy, and also not just in terms of efficacy, in terms of tolerability. That ulcerative colitis program Phase III has started already and is recruiting. We are hopeful that we will be announcing the opening of the Phase III and patients coming in for the Crohn's disease over the next few months. So we are very excited about moving TL1A eagerly and appropriately aggressively move it in Phase III to really sort of outline the really differentiated profile that we have seen for TL1A, and specifically, our compound.\n I should also emphasize that we also are looking at TL1A not just within sort of inflammatory bowel disease, but we're also interested in other diseases. And one of the things that's really interesting about TL1A, it is blocking inflammation. But there is reasons to believe that it can have profound effects on fibrosis, and that's our interest in Crohn's disease.\n But there are other diseases, for example, in the lung where fibrosis is a really important component. And we will be interested to see those. We have other assets moving forward both from the Prometheus acquisition that is not the TL1A as well as other internal that are moving forward with Alacrity.\n In relationship to neuroscience, we hope to be getting the readout with MK-8189. We have other programs that are moving and advancing. And we have made some commitments in the early discovery space in a BD standpoint to accelerate some of our works that have been made public.\n I think over the next 1 to 2 years, we'll see readouts Phase IIbs, Phase Is moving to Phase II. But I think at that point, we will be able to speak more fully. But I think the investment in neuroscience, I think, is critically important. From a health care unmet need, you have to list from an economic value to the health care system and population. Especially in the United States, neuro disease continues to be a really important place, and I would say neuro disease not just in terms of degenerative but -- not just classic neuro disease but in the psychiatry arena as well. And you've seen others advance business development in that space. We're interested in continuing in business development there, but also importantly, moving our own internal program, the lead program being MK-8189. \nOperator: Our next question from Daina Graybosch. \nDaina Graybosch: I want to ask some on pneumococcal vaccine. You mentioned several times V116 is customized for adults 65 and older. In the ACIP meeting, they discussed a recommendation in adult 50 or older. And I wonder if you could comment on where you think that ACIP recommendation will end up for V116. And on V117, I wonder if you could talk about how the stack scene, which I believe is now in Phase I is customized for pediatric patients. \nRobert Davis: Yes. Maybe I can start, Daina, and then Dean can add. Obviously, I would just start by saying we were very pleased with the overall tone and tenor of the discussion coming out of the ACIP meeting. And as you look at what we have with V116, we continue to believe -- if you look at the strength of the data behind that, and we've talked about -- Dean mentioned some of the clinical readouts that have come. But recall, we cover 83% of the serotypes-causing disease in adults. That's 30% higher than PCV20. So it's significant, and that was how it was specifically designed, targeting those serotypes which are most prevalent in adult disease.\n As a result of that, we continue to believe the value proposition of V116 is very compelling. If you look at the cost effectiveness, it's going to be a very cost-effective vaccine. And as a result, I think that's why you started to see the ACIP ask questions about the 50 to 65 age cohort as well as the 65-plus.\n So I don't want to get ahead of the ACIP and their recommendation. But I would say our belief and conviction in the value of the data and the value this vaccine will bring for patients in the pneumococcal space is significant. And I would expect overall that we're going to see broad coverage coming out of the ACIP. \nDean Li: Yes. I would just add, again, we want to be respectful of ACIP and the FDA. But you did point out something that I think is something that clearly we took notice. When Rob talks about that 83% versus 50% and 30% more, and the specific question that you're asking about, 50 to 64, I would remind everyone that dropping that age for universal vaccination have been considered previously for other vaccines. And they could not come to a situation where they thought that it would be a good idea based on cost effectiveness and as such. And by increasing it from 50% to 83%, we believe that we changed the calculus, and that made why there is renewed interest in lowering that age based on the broader coverage given for V116. \nRobert Davis: And I think there was a second question you had, Daina, about V117. I'll just maybe give a general answer, which is, obviously, if you look at the strategy of V116, it's the same strategy with V117: How do we develop an investigational PCV vaccine that is targeted specifically to those serotypes that cause disease in children, in peds, without hopefully causing untoward effects. And so it's a model that follows that. We've not given any details to the additional serotypes or our thinking. But just understand that if you look at the model of V116, V117 is the same thing in peds. \nOperator: Our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. \nJames Shin: Firstly, I know Merck does not provide product-level guidance, but given WINREVAIR's importance and investor focus, can you provide any color on WINREVAIR contribution to guidance? And then second one is for Dean on REJOICE-Ovarian and I suppose precision oncology in general. But does the field know how much overlap there is between [indiscernible] FRalpha? And then for patritumab, I know the data for HER3 shows high expression in advanced patients, but there's a lot of development in advanced space. So how does Merck envision patritumab to be positioned or sequenced? \nRobert Davis: Yes. Maybe, James, I'll start. And thank you for the question. The short answer is, unfortunately, we don't provide product-level guidance. So I don't think we want to get into trying to tell you what we see WINREVAIR as being a contributor in 2024.\n But with that said, I think it's important to make a few points just so you understand how we're seeing it. First of all, we're very excited to provide this novel treatment for patients with PAH. As you know, we think this will be a game changer in that space. We were well prepared for the launch. And I can tell you the launch, although very early, is going well so far. We've seen an increasing number of prescriptions being written. We've seen repeat prescriptions, and that's coming both from the COE space, from the Centers of Excellence, which is about 150 in the United States, as well as from non-COEs, which is a good development.\n We've already begun making shipments to patients' homes. And hopefully, we'll have patients being dosed very soon, if not already.\n And then I think the other thing I'd note is the prescribers as well as the locations are both from the Centers of Excellence and also non-COE. So that's something to note. And then finally, from a payer perspective, we're seeing good access. No real limits. In fact, we already have several payers who have established coverage policies. And I think as Caroline pointed out in the prepared comments, very consistent with the label and what we saw in STELLAR. But the fact that we've seen policies enacted giving coverage to patients already this quickly after launch, we see as a good sign. \n It's obviously early. But everything so far looks quite good. So our confidence in a successful launch has not changed. We continue to see this consistent with our expectations. And as we move forward, we'll give you appropriate level of transparency. But I just want to give flavor, even though we can't give the specific guidance you were asking for. \n Dean, I'll let you take the second part of the question. \nDean Li: Yes. So I'll just add a little bit in relationship to WINREVAIR. I think it's important to emphasize that the indication or the label that we have is a broad indication and is based on STELLAR. And there will be potential data flows that will continue to inform and strengthen the field. We have STELLAR and SOTERIA, which is open label. We have ZENITH, which is advanced, and that will look at mortality and morbidity; and HYPERION, which is in more -- earlier in the journey.\n We have the European action that will happen in the second half of 2024. And I would just emphasize that this is something that health care professionals and self-administration is possible. And in relationship to that, there will be a demand for innovation, and we hope to provide that innovation as this becomes even more used in a self-administration standpoint.\n You asked a number of questions and many of the questions related, and some of it got blurred out, but some of it related to ovarian, but more broadly speaking, tissue targeting and ADCs. So I'll just give you an overview. When we look at the field, we look at cancers where there is IO and chemo and that combination. And where will we see that? We ask ourselves, can you combine an IO agent with a chemo agent? And we think about KEYTRUDA, but we also think about next-gen tissue targeting IO agents, such as the recent immune engagers that we have from Harpoon. \n And then on the other hand, we think about chemo, we think of precision targeting like RAS, how can it combine? And we also think in terms of ADCs. And the specific case that you're talking about, you have HER3 patritumab. That's moving along in EGFR non-small cell lung cancer. In B7-H3, there's prominent data that's in small cell lung cancer, maybe in prostate. And for CDH6 itself, that ovarian data is quite interesting, and that's raludotatug. \n At least for us, it's very interesting because the initial data with our partners in Daiichi Sankyo is striking to us. Because in that patient population, it looked like allcomers did extremely well and that in some situations, you think about a biomarker. But for the CDH6, the impact across sort of biomarker subsets was quite impressive. So I hope that gives you a general structure and we're happy to -- and thank you very much for that question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat with Evercore. \nUmer Raffat: I'm just trying to think through your next-gen HPV vaccine. And I guess, how should we think about potential penetration rates with a revaccination opportunity with the new broader-spectrum HPV, especially in patients who have already taken GARDASIL 9. \nDean Li: Revaccination and relationship to HPV, is that what the question is? \nRobert Davis: The new [indiscernible]. \nDean Li: With the G9+. I'm struggling to answer your question because I first got to make a G9+ that works really, really well. And when I get that, that will be great because there are patient populations that I think would be extremely well served. But I would also emphasize that we've just talked about cancer. We talked about early-stage cancer. This is the time that you can really treat and potentially cure, but we're in the business of preventing cancers as well. \n One of the questions that comes to us is that in certain patient populations, you want a vaccine that -- the data, for example, Scandinavia, it's 90-plus reduction -- 90% reduction in cancer incidents. And then the recent American Cancer Society. We are wondering whether if you make a G9+ vaccine, whether you can make the argument, if we're successful with the G9+ and what we hope to aspire for, whether you could fundamentally change how one recommends cancer screening for women in relationship to cervical cancer and also the reduction both in men and women of many other cancers outside of cervical cancer. \nCaroline Litchfield: This is Caroline. I'll just add that as we sit here today, we all know there are many, many people around the world that have not received a vaccine to prevent them against, to help protect them from HPV-related cancers. With the possibility of improving upon G9 with a multivalent vaccine, we're hopeful that we can provide further protection, especially for different population groups. And we will price the vaccine appropriately based on the benefit that it will provide. So we're looking forward to continuing to see growth in GARDASIL and see how the science evolves with our clinical programs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. \nTimothy Anderson: I have a few questions on KEYTRUDA subcu. It may not be scientifically sexy, but of course, it could be quite commercially meaningful. So we'll see that data, I believe, later this year. Any risk whatsoever to that readout? Or can we consider it to be a slam dunk?\n Second question is when the subcu launches in the U.S., presumably next year, will uptake be fast or slow or somewhere in between? And then eventually, how much can a subcu account for the franchise on a volume or a patient basis? \nDean Li: So I'll take the first part of that. I remind myself, nothing is slam dunk once you place innovative drugs in patients. So I'll answer that question. But I think you highlighted really the pembro plus hyaluronidase that we're advancing. I would disagree a little bit. I do kind of think it's sexy in some ways. And that D770, we will be sharing that data by early 2025.\n The reason I think it's really an important innovation is to really increase the access. You've seen the number of early-stage cancer readout that are coming through with pembrolizumab and KEYTRUDA and especially in the earlier stages when we talk about KEYNOTE-671, when we talk about in renal cell carcinoma, where we have OS benefit. I think this is going to be really, really important for patients. It will also be important in patients for treatment, especially in those who have monotherapy and those especially combos with oral agents because it just makes it so much more accessible. So we think this is an important program and that it could have substantial impact on patients and their access to PD-1, where we know the foundational elements of PD-1. And in terms of financial... \nRobert Davis: Yes. Maybe, Tim, I'll just provide some commentary on your questions on uptake and how much of the patient population this can account for. As we think about uptake of this opportunity, I would first point out that we see really -- it starts with the strength of the clinical data underlying the IO agent itself. So it's more about the confidence they have in KEYTRUDA. And then secondarily, it's about the delivery mechanism, which is important as we think about obviously leveraging the data we have and just the breadth of what KEYTRUDA is.\n But I will tell you that as we think about bringing this forward when we do launch, our goal will be the price appropriately with the goal of driving quick adoption. So we do want to see adoption happen, and we do think you will see it. Obviously, if you look at then the size of the patient population where it could be, just to give you a sense, by 2028, if we look at the patients who are on monotherapy with KEYTRUDA who are using combinations with orals and those who are moving into earlier stages of disease through some of our adjuvant and neoadjuvant areas with KEYTRUDA, that represents about 50% of the patient population at that time. So that is really the addressable market for what we see the subcu offering to be.\n And potentially, we're not foreclosing the opportunity to also look into the metastatic setting and people being given care in institutions as well as those moving outside of the institutions. But obviously, the value to the patient is ease of use, ability to use it outside of the hospital setting. The time and share is obviously less if you're getting a subcu versus an IV. And then from a cost to the health care system, the ability to not have a patient sitting in the chair for as long allowing for more patients to move through, we think, actually drives access and improves the providing of care as well. So we see it both beneficial from a patient perspective and from the provider perspective, and that's why we do think you'll see uptake of this important medicine when we bring it forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. \nLouise Chen: I just wanted to ask you for ASCO on June 3. Are there any specific readouts updates that you're very excited about presenting? \nDean Li: I think there's just going to be a stream of data. There's going to be follow-ups and a series of KEYNOTE, whether it be gastric, hepatocellular, biliary, bladder, non-small cell lung cancer. There will be discussions of many of the programs that I think you're beginning to see coming up in the clinical trial website in relationship to a whole series of Phase III related to molecules that you're familiar with, but also molecules that are sort of earlier in our Phase III development, ranging from bomedemstat to the KRAS program, to many of the ADCs and the updates that we've shown in relationship to not just the Daiichi Sankyo ADCs, but the other ADCs, whether it be TROP2 Claudin or [indiscernible]. So you'll have a whole full array of discussions of those compounds, some at the ASCO, but some at the ASCO investor event. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thanks, Louise. I know we have several more people in the queue. We're going to go an extra 5 or 10 minutes to try to get to as many questions as possible. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. \nTrung Huynh: Trung Huynh from UBS. On the WINREVAIR launch, thanks for the comments today on access and coverage. On approval, you noted that 2/3 of your PAH patients would likely Part D and third commercial. Perhaps can you expand on the free assistance program that you're hoping to initiate? And what proportion of those Part D patients do you think could be receiving free product this year? \nRobert Davis: Yes. I appreciate the question. So as you point out, we are very focused on ensuring that patients get access to the medicine. We're very much committed to it. And that's why we do have -- in addition to our normal programs we would run, we do have the access program we run. That program is actually independent of our commercial operations. We don't really report data coming out of that because it's run through a separate foundation and with the goal, frankly, of making sure that patients get medicines there. So that is available. It can be accessed on our website, and we're committed to making sure patients get the medicine. But specifics on that, we're not going to go into. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: Maybe on your personalized cancer vaccine with Moderna, as the Phase III sort of nears completion of enrollment, it of course begs the question around the potential to sort of file based on the existing data you have. Can you maybe just update us on your thoughts there and whether you think you still need Phase III data or manufacturing would preclude an early filing? Any help there would be appreciated. \nDean Li: Yes, I'll take that. I mean I don't want to speak about whether the FDA will take what action or not. But I'll just reemphasize to everyone what is exciting about our I&T program and our excitement working with Moderna. So here, we're inducing and coaxing sort of immunity. And we're mixing it with a drug that's well known that and leases pre-existing immunity, which is KEYTRUDA.\n What we have in our hands is a randomized, early-stage IO sensitive trial, where it is very clear of the contribution of components of the INT, not in immunogenicity, but in clinical benefit. So I just want to highlight that about our data as one looks at the data of others.\n We also have begun to show that we are moving it in Phase III in adjuvant melanoma and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer and our ability to move that with speed and rigor but get patients recruited, which is going well, I think will be very important because you're going to need a Phase III regardless of what the FDA decides on an accelerated approval or not. And so that's what we're focused on.\n We're also focused on looking at other IO-sensitive tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. And I would just emphasize the strength of the data in relationship to durability is being answered. The ability for us to open these trials and successfully advance it is being answered. And we clearly have work to do with our colleagues who we respect deeply for what they've done in relationship to manufacturing.\n Any -- all mRNA vaccine, I mean, they've really pushed the envelope here. Our ability to do that will be important to make this an important treatment. As far as the FDA's decision, the FDA will need to make their decision as to how they consider the opportunity. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Just a couple of GARDASIL questions. You're pointing to a more evenly distributed China sales this year, and it seems like a tougher 2Q comp. But can you just directionally talk about growth for GARDASIL more broadly for the year? I guess the heart of it is still a healthy growth asset for you this year. And the second one on GARDASIL is if we were to move to a single dose of GARDASIL-9, what does that mean commercially and from a sales perspective for the franchise? \nCaroline Litchfield: Chris, it's Caroline. So in terms of the phasing of GARDASIL, as you pointed out, during 2023, we saw in China an acceleration of the shipment from the second half of the year to the first half of the year, specifically to the second quarter. What that's done is it's provided an actual tailwind to revenue growth in the first quarter for China, but it will provide a headwind more significant in the second quarter. And that's what we've called out.\n As we look at overall growth for GARDASIL, given where we are with the level of vaccinations across the world, given the manufacturing that we have been scaling up, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth during 2024. And in 2025, we will see our manufacturing capacity unconstrained so enabling us to further supply and support the market.\n As we've talked in the past, our opportunities for growth are significant as we look to continue to improve on adolescent vaccination rates, as we look to improve upon gender-neutral vaccinations, as we look to really activate the mid-adult segment, but increasingly get to the lower-income and middle-income markets, which will come at a different price point.\n As we sit here today, continue to be confident in the outlook for GARDASIL over both the near and the long term. As we look at the possibility of a single dose of GARDASIL, the study that we are conducting will be a comprehensive study and will take some time to unfold. What we're seeing in the marketplace currently is where certain low-income markets are implementing a single-dose regimen, they are also increasing the numbers of people they are vaccinating by broadening the age cohort or also opting to vaccinate males at this stage. We'll have to be long term how the data plays out with regards to a single dose to ensure that we will price our vaccine based on the benefit that we're bringing and we vaccinate as many people in the world that we can. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. \nLuisa Hector: I also have questions on the WINREVAIR launch. I just wanted to check how straightforward the subcutaneous administration is and when you might expect to launch an auto-injector. Also, should we actually expect the Part D access to come online at a similar pace as commercial? I'm just not sure whether that's something that's maybe sitting more into next year.\n And if I can, just another question on that with Part D is that you price for the Part D restructure next year. How do you expect payers to behave when this happens. I can see that the payer will take on a greater burden for higher-priced oral therapies. Do you expect some pushback within the actual drug that you would have higher rebates at that point? Or do you think that incremental burden for the payers might be spread more broadly across all products? It's a kind of bigger-picture question that WINREVAIR brings it into focus. \nDean Li: So this is Dean. I'll answer your questions in terms of delivery of WINREVAIR. We have it in a vial, and we have it in a situation where both a health care provider or self-administration is both feasible, possible and will be used. We believe that the vast majority with time that people will use it as self-administration. This is a patient population that's quite used to doing injection. So we think that, that will be able to navigate and that the patients will get access.\n But as you point out, further innovation will be demanded for, and an auto-injector will be critically important. We are doing the studies right now to evaluate how do we provide such an option, and we hope to have those options and those plans more public in the near future. But we agree with you totally in the fact that a future auto-injector will be important. \nCaroline Litchfield: And Luisa, this is Caroline. At this stage, we are seeing a real acceptance of the value proposition of WINREVAIR in the United States. We're seeing policy for coverage equally across both the Medicare and Medicaid patient population as well as the commercial segment. So as we move forward, we'll look forward to just helping as many patients as we can across all of those segments, irrelevant of their coverage. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. \nSeamus Fernandez: Wanted to ask actually about your RSV-targeted antibody, how you're thinking about that, the optionality for it and the market size and Merck's potential participation in this market as it relates to the competitors' global supply constraints at this point in time. It seems like coming to market more aggressively or as aggressively as possible could actually make for a meaningful market opportunity for Merck.\n And then just a follow-up. Rob, I wanted to just get your sort of qualitative view 3 years, 4 years in thinking about the evolution of the business. 2028-2029 still represents a meaningful challenge with KEYTRUDA. But as you look forward to the rest of this year and heading into 2025, how important is business development to Merck from here in terms of the size and type of acquisitions I think investors have certainly applauded what Merck has executed on in the last year for sort of mid- to later-stage assets. \nDean Li: Yes. So I'll take the RSV question. So clesrovimab, we're excited about it. As many of the people know, it's a monoclonal antibody and it's a way to get passive immunity to infants. We think it's really important as we have seen recently. And ours is a single fixed dose and has the durability in terms of covering a whole RSV season, I think, is critically important. And the ability to give this to an infant any time and -- versus, for example, alternative strategies, which is maternal vaccination.\n And then also, we believe that this will be a distinguished monoclonal antibody and it's high barrier to resistance. So we're excited about moving and -- seeing that data and moving with both speed and rigor to get this to the market because we think it will be an important contributor, especially given what we've seen in the RSV season just this past season.\n I do want to just take this one moment to just say it's not just the RSV vaccine that we're very excited. We're also very excited because it's very much in the lay press in our dengue V181, which is a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. And we're moving with equal eagerness to move that forward into Phase III, as we've already seen data from our colleagues in Institute Butantan about the effectiveness and efficacy of this vaccine.\n But I'll turn it back to Rob. \nRobert Davis: Yes. No. Thanks for the question. And so if I would just kind of, I guess, think a little bit about where we've been in over the last 3 years, a few points I would want to raise. One, I think we've made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, and I give all credit to Dean, to our R&D colleagues for what they've been able to do, how they have been able to really move just flawlessly products through our pipeline. It's amazing you think of it now 3 years in, we haven't had really any major failures. The one maybe hiccup with islatravir, but that's coming back. And so I feel very proud of what our colleagues in R&D have been able to do.\n And then I think about from a commercial perspective, from a manufacturing perspective, we're pulling the products through, we're showing value. The fact that we're ready for the launch with WINREVAIR shows how we can build capability very quickly. We did it in KEYTRUDA, we did it in JANUVIA and now we're doing it in WINREVAIR, and we'll do it in new spaces coming forward. So we feel very good about that. So across all elements, R&D, commercial, manufacturing, the business is delivering.\n And so as we sit here today, if our clinical success continues, I think you're going to see us with a more diversified set of growth drivers over time than, frankly, we've had in many years, if ever. And that's very important. And it all is really what leads to the confidence you've heard me express in other settings, that I'm increasingly less focused on 2028. And I would remind you, by the way, it's a staggered LOE. So it's 2028 in the U.S.; in China, it's 2031; in Europe, in 2032 and in Japan. So it's not a one-moment event. It actually happens over time.\n But that being said, as you've heard me say, I see it is more of a hill than a cliff. And my confidence that we're going to come back with fast growth after that is very high. And we're very focused on the sustainable engine from 2030 to 2040 at this point. So I feel good about where we are, but I just want to reinforce it's a team effort, and I've been left with a great team. \nPeter Dannenbaum: Great. Thank you, Seamus, and thank you all for your time and your interest today. I'm hoping to see many of you at our ASCO event on June 3 or at a few of the conferences that we'll be attending this quarter. So thank you all very much. \nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Dean Li",
            "content": "Thank you, Caroline. In the first quarter, we continued to make progress with a steady cadence of clinical regulatory milestones across our pipeline. Today, I will provide updates from our cardiometabolic disease portfolio, HIV and vaccine programs and close with advances in our oncology pipeline. As Rob and Caroline noted, late last month, we received approval from the FDA for WINREVAIR, our first-in-class active and signaling inhibitor for the treatment of dose living with pulmonary arterial hypertension to increase exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and reduce the risk of clinical worsening events. \n WINREVAIR is a novel therapeutic option that targets a new PAH treatment pathway and is indicated to treat a broad PAH population. This approval marks a significant step towards our goal of transforming the treatment journey for many patients with PAH. WINREVAIR is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency with a decision anticipated in the second half of this year. The Phase III ZENITH and Hyperion studies evaluating patients with more advanced disease and those earlier on in their disease journey, respectively, are ongoing as well as the Phase II cadence trial evaluating WHO Group II pulmonary hypertension, a type of left heart disease.\n Our commitment extends to a broad range of pulmonary hypertension, informed by results from the Phase II cohort of the Phase II/III insignia PAH study evaluating MK-5475, our inhaled soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator and the STELLAR trial results for WINREVAIR, we have made the decision to focus the development of MK-5475 on WHO Group 3.1 pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD, and not further proceed in PAH. PH-COPD is an area of significant need with no specific therapies currently approved. Our HIV pipeline continues to advance. Last month, presentations at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections, reinforce progress in our strategy to develop less frequent dosing regimens for managing and treating HIV.\n We believe these programs have the potential to help address adherence, stigma and other challenges faced by some individuals taking daily antiretroviral pills. In collaboration with Gilead, safety and efficacy findings were presented from a Phase II study evaluating a once-weekly oral combination of islatravir, an investigation on nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor and lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor for the treatment of adults living with HIV. At 24 weeks, the trial met its primary endpoint and in a secondary endpoint maintained a high rate of viral suppression. Additional longer-term data will be presented at a later date.\n In addition, safety and tolerability data were presented for MK-8527 a novel oral NRTTI candidates from 2 Phase I trials that evaluated ascending single dose and multiple doses in adults 18 to 55 years old, not infected with HIV. MK-8527 is being investigated as a potential monthly option for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Vaccines remain an important element of our pipeline, and we are making progress across several programs. Findings from multiple Phase III trials of V116, our investigational 21 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were presented at the meeting of the International Society of pneumonia and Pneumococcal Diseases last month. V116 was shown to be immunogenic for all 21 serotypes covered by the vaccine, including a pneumococcal vaccine naive and vaccine experience adults as well as those at increased risk for pneumococcal disease. If approved, V116 would be the first vaccine specifically designed to address the majority of serotypes that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in adults, ages 65 and older.\n The target action date is June 17. The meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on immunization practices is scheduled shortly thereafter. Since the initial approval of GARDASIL, a steady flow of clinical and real-world evidence has been generated to support the favorable efficacy, effectiveness, safety and long-term durability of protection against certain human papillomavirus-related cancers and diseases in both males and females. Despite the proven public health benefit of HPV vaccination, the latest global cancer statistics from the International Agency for Research on Cancer indicate there is more to do to help increase vaccination rates.\n The latest statistics from 2022 ranked cervical cancer as the fourth most common cancer globally in terms of incidents and mortality in women and the leading cause of cancer death in 37 countries, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and Southeast Asia regions. At the Urogen Congress, last month, we disclosed plans to build on the development of GARDASIL with a new clinical program to identify a novel multivalent HPV vaccine candidate with the potential to extend protection against a broader array of HPV types. This includes several types known to disproportionately impact African and Asian populations and individuals of African and Asian descent. First-in-human studies are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter of this year.\n In addition, we announced plans to conduct 2 randomized, double-blind multiyear clinical trials in females and males ages 16 to 26 years to examine the short- and long-term efficacy and immunogenicity of a single dose of GARDASIL-9 versus the currently approved 3-dose regimen. The goal of these studies is to generate data that clearly demonstrates whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved regimen, while also satisfying the high standards required by regulatory authorities. The clinical trials are anticipated to start enrolling in the fourth quarter.\n In oncology, we continue to focus on our 3-pillared strategy comprised of immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting agents. In immuno-oncology, September 2024 will mark a decade since the first approval of KEYTRUDA in metastatic melanoma. KEYTRUDA has since amassed approvals for 39 indication and continues to reinforce its reputation as a foundational therapy for certain types of cancer. Building on the recent FDA approval for KEYTRUDA in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of FIGO 2014, Stage II through IVA cervical cancer, we recently announced that the pivotal KEYNOTE-A18 trial met its primary endpoint of overall survival, potentially providing a new standard of care for these patients. Our commitment to providing better options to prevent and treat cervical cancer remain strong. Also, in women's cancer, the Phase III KEYNOTE-868 trial, known as NRG-GY018 was granted priority review by the FDA for the first-line treatment of patients with primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. This agency has set a target action date of June 21.\n Outside of the U.S., the European Commission approved KEYTRUDA in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy followed by adjuvant KEYTRUDA in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer at high risk of recurrence based on the Phase III KEYNOTE-671 study. This marks the first approval in Europe for an anti-PD-1 PD-L1 therapy as part of a treatment regimen for the neoadjuvant followed by adjuvant treatment of resectable non-small cell lung cancer based on positive overall survival results.\n Next to precision targeting. Building on the success of KEYTRUDA for certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer, earlier this month, we announced the initiation of the Phase III clinical trial for MK-1084, an investigational oral selective KRAS G12C inhibitor in combination with KEYTRUDA for the first-line treatment of certain patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. The decision to proceed to Phase III was based upon early promising evidence from a Phase I study showing antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile. KRAS is one of the most prevalent oncogenes in human cancers, and G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\n In the tissue targeting space, we are moving with speed and rigor to advance a broad pipeline of antibody drug conjugates with multiple planned and ongoing Phase III trials. In just over 6 months, we have made remarkable progress in our collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. Recently, we announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase II/III REJOICE OVARIAN01 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of raludotatug deruxtecan, an investigational CDH6 directed DXDADC in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We are poised to begin a Phase III study evaluating ifinatamab/deruxtecan, a B7-H3-directed ADC in small cell lung cancer, a notably difficult-to-treat tumor type. New treatment options are desperately needed for these patients where the prognosis remains poor.\n We are pleased to have recently completed the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics, which provides novel T cell engagers, including MK-6070, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 targeting T cell engager, also being evaluated in certain types of small cell lung cancer as well as neuroendocrine tumors.\n Finally, please mark your calendars for the evening of Monday, June 3, where we will host an investor event at ASCO in Chicago and provide an update on our diverse portfolio of immuno-oncology, precision molecular and tissue-targeting agents.\n Looking forward, June promises to be a busy month with 3 regulatory action dates, including V116 for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults. KEYTRUDA for primary advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma; and patritumab/deruxtecan for advanced EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\n We continue to execute on our strategy with a focus on operational excellence and look forward to providing further updates on our progress throughout the year.\n And now I will turn the call back to Peter. Well, thank you very much. Yes, we are excited about the build-out that we have in cardiovascular metabolic. You pointed out the programs that have the most visibility right now. But let me assure you, there will be other programs that you will have more visibility over the coming years.\n In relationship to your question about GLP and obesity, I think there's 2 ways to look at it: you can look at it from a GLP angle, and you can look at it from an obesity angle. If you look at it from a GLP angle, there has been really important work showing its impact in diabetes, weight loss, more recently, in cardiovascular outcomes, most recently in sleep apnea.\n And you're right, we're very interested in relationship to MASH. We think that's an also important outcome. And we also think that there will be distinct populations, whether you call it obese or whether you call it NASH or -- within that GLP space. With distinct relations, it will be important to give a benefit of a molecule that really takes care of the primary concern. And that's our play, for example, in NASH, where we think we have a very tolerable drug that has significant reduction in liver fat and also gives a weight loss of 10% to 12%.\n When you look at that, I think these different outcomes may need different molecules. More generally, if you're talking about obesity, I do think that there's important work going on right now. But I think that there could be another wave where people start thinking about orals, how tolerable they are, the accessibility they are, combinations, how do you maintain, how you preserve muscle and also additional outcomes. And it may not be that the same molecule is the best molecule that wins out in every one of those sub populations. And so I would just -- I wonder if there will be some fractionation of the patient population when you say the word, for example, generally, obesity. And we wonder if there's opportunity there. Yes. So this is one of my more favorite projects. So I appreciate that you actually ask a question about it. When you look at KRAS, as you point out, there is -- it's one of the most important driver mutations in multiple cancers. And if you say more broadly, not KRAS but pan-RAS, that is also true.\n In relationship to KRAS G12C, that's a small percentage of all the KRAS mutations and all the RAS mutations. But where KRAS G12C is especially prominent is in non-small cell lung cancer. It's, depending on the percentage, 12% to 15% in that patient population.\n And I will also emphasize that we have a lot of data in relationship to that patient population in non-small cell lung cancer. It's KEYNOTE-189. It's chemo plus IO. You need a potent compound with a KRAS to move it into first line. That's the game that we're trying to play. So it is crowded. But what you're looking for is a potent compound that has tremendous monotherapy efficacy. But most importantly, when you combine it with, for example, pembro, you maintain the dose, you maintain the ability to not have dose modifications. And that's the data that made us excited about this because I think we reported an ORR of 71% in combination. So that's why we're advancing that.\n The race for us is to get it in first line and then to think about other KRAS indications and IO-sensitive/insensitive and also other molecules that are coming through in the lung cancer space. And some of them are related to antibody drug conjugate. So we are very excited about our KRAS G12C program, 1084, which is moving to Phase III. Thank you very much. So I'll first touch immunology and specifically in the TL1A space. So that TL1A, we think that it will be a highly effective -- the higher efficacy, and also not just in terms of efficacy, in terms of tolerability. That ulcerative colitis program Phase III has started already and is recruiting. We are hopeful that we will be announcing the opening of the Phase III and patients coming in for the Crohn's disease over the next few months. So we are very excited about moving TL1A eagerly and appropriately aggressively move it in Phase III to really sort of outline the really differentiated profile that we have seen for TL1A, and specifically, our compound.\n I should also emphasize that we also are looking at TL1A not just within sort of inflammatory bowel disease, but we're also interested in other diseases. And one of the things that's really interesting about TL1A, it is blocking inflammation. But there is reasons to believe that it can have profound effects on fibrosis, and that's our interest in Crohn's disease.\n But there are other diseases, for example, in the lung where fibrosis is a really important component. And we will be interested to see those. We have other assets moving forward both from the Prometheus acquisition that is not the TL1A as well as other internal that are moving forward with Alacrity.\n In relationship to neuroscience, we hope to be getting the readout with MK-8189. We have other programs that are moving and advancing. And we have made some commitments in the early discovery space in a BD standpoint to accelerate some of our works that have been made public.\n I think over the next 1 to 2 years, we'll see readouts Phase IIbs, Phase Is moving to Phase II. But I think at that point, we will be able to speak more fully. But I think the investment in neuroscience, I think, is critically important. From a health care unmet need, you have to list from an economic value to the health care system and population. Especially in the United States, neuro disease continues to be a really important place, and I would say neuro disease not just in terms of degenerative but -- not just classic neuro disease but in the psychiatry arena as well. And you've seen others advance business development in that space. We're interested in continuing in business development there, but also importantly, moving our own internal program, the lead program being MK-8189. Yes. I would just add, again, we want to be respectful of ACIP and the FDA. But you did point out something that I think is something that clearly we took notice. When Rob talks about that 83% versus 50% and 30% more, and the specific question that you're asking about, 50 to 64, I would remind everyone that dropping that age for universal vaccination have been considered previously for other vaccines. And they could not come to a situation where they thought that it would be a good idea based on cost effectiveness and as such. And by increasing it from 50% to 83%, we believe that we changed the calculus, and that made why there is renewed interest in lowering that age based on the broader coverage given for V116. Yes. So I'll just add a little bit in relationship to WINREVAIR. I think it's important to emphasize that the indication or the label that we have is a broad indication and is based on STELLAR. And there will be potential data flows that will continue to inform and strengthen the field. We have STELLAR and SOTERIA, which is open label. We have ZENITH, which is advanced, and that will look at mortality and morbidity; and HYPERION, which is in more -- earlier in the journey.\n We have the European action that will happen in the second half of 2024. And I would just emphasize that this is something that health care professionals and self-administration is possible. And in relationship to that, there will be a demand for innovation, and we hope to provide that innovation as this becomes even more used in a self-administration standpoint.\n You asked a number of questions and many of the questions related, and some of it got blurred out, but some of it related to ovarian, but more broadly speaking, tissue targeting and ADCs. So I'll just give you an overview. When we look at the field, we look at cancers where there is IO and chemo and that combination. And where will we see that? We ask ourselves, can you combine an IO agent with a chemo agent? And we think about KEYTRUDA, but we also think about next-gen tissue targeting IO agents, such as the recent immune engagers that we have from Harpoon. \n And then on the other hand, we think about chemo, we think of precision targeting like RAS, how can it combine? And we also think in terms of ADCs. And the specific case that you're talking about, you have HER3 patritumab. That's moving along in EGFR non-small cell lung cancer. In B7-H3, there's prominent data that's in small cell lung cancer, maybe in prostate. And for CDH6 itself, that ovarian data is quite interesting, and that's raludotatug. \n At least for us, it's very interesting because the initial data with our partners in Daiichi Sankyo is striking to us. Because in that patient population, it looked like allcomers did extremely well and that in some situations, you think about a biomarker. But for the CDH6, the impact across sort of biomarker subsets was quite impressive. So I hope that gives you a general structure and we're happy to -- and thank you very much for that question. Revaccination and relationship to HPV, is that what the question is? With the G9+. I'm struggling to answer your question because I first got to make a G9+ that works really, really well. And when I get that, that will be great because there are patient populations that I think would be extremely well served. But I would also emphasize that we've just talked about cancer. We talked about early-stage cancer. This is the time that you can really treat and potentially cure, but we're in the business of preventing cancers as well. \n One of the questions that comes to us is that in certain patient populations, you want a vaccine that -- the data, for example, Scandinavia, it's 90-plus reduction -- 90% reduction in cancer incidents. And then the recent American Cancer Society. We are wondering whether if you make a G9+ vaccine, whether you can make the argument, if we're successful with the G9+ and what we hope to aspire for, whether you could fundamentally change how one recommends cancer screening for women in relationship to cervical cancer and also the reduction both in men and women of many other cancers outside of cervical cancer. So I'll take the first part of that. I remind myself, nothing is slam dunk once you place innovative drugs in patients. So I'll answer that question. But I think you highlighted really the pembro plus hyaluronidase that we're advancing. I would disagree a little bit. I do kind of think it's sexy in some ways. And that D770, we will be sharing that data by early 2025.\n The reason I think it's really an important innovation is to really increase the access. You've seen the number of early-stage cancer readout that are coming through with pembrolizumab and KEYTRUDA and especially in the earlier stages when we talk about KEYNOTE-671, when we talk about in renal cell carcinoma, where we have OS benefit. I think this is going to be really, really important for patients. It will also be important in patients for treatment, especially in those who have monotherapy and those especially combos with oral agents because it just makes it so much more accessible. So we think this is an important program and that it could have substantial impact on patients and their access to PD-1, where we know the foundational elements of PD-1. And in terms of financial... I think there's just going to be a stream of data. There's going to be follow-ups and a series of KEYNOTE, whether it be gastric, hepatocellular, biliary, bladder, non-small cell lung cancer. There will be discussions of many of the programs that I think you're beginning to see coming up in the clinical trial website in relationship to a whole series of Phase III related to molecules that you're familiar with, but also molecules that are sort of earlier in our Phase III development, ranging from bomedemstat to the KRAS program, to many of the ADCs and the updates that we've shown in relationship to not just the Daiichi Sankyo ADCs, but the other ADCs, whether it be TROP2 Claudin or [indiscernible]. So you'll have a whole full array of discussions of those compounds, some at the ASCO, but some at the ASCO investor event. Yes, I'll take that. I mean I don't want to speak about whether the FDA will take what action or not. But I'll just reemphasize to everyone what is exciting about our I&T program and our excitement working with Moderna. So here, we're inducing and coaxing sort of immunity. And we're mixing it with a drug that's well known that and leases pre-existing immunity, which is KEYTRUDA.\n What we have in our hands is a randomized, early-stage IO sensitive trial, where it is very clear of the contribution of components of the INT, not in immunogenicity, but in clinical benefit. So I just want to highlight that about our data as one looks at the data of others.\n We also have begun to show that we are moving it in Phase III in adjuvant melanoma and adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer and our ability to move that with speed and rigor but get patients recruited, which is going well, I think will be very important because you're going to need a Phase III regardless of what the FDA decides on an accelerated approval or not. And so that's what we're focused on.\n We're also focused on looking at other IO-sensitive tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. And I would just emphasize the strength of the data in relationship to durability is being answered. The ability for us to open these trials and successfully advance it is being answered. And we clearly have work to do with our colleagues who we respect deeply for what they've done in relationship to manufacturing.\n Any -- all mRNA vaccine, I mean, they've really pushed the envelope here. Our ability to do that will be important to make this an important treatment. As far as the FDA's decision, the FDA will need to make their decision as to how they consider the opportunity. So this is Dean. I'll answer your questions in terms of delivery of WINREVAIR. We have it in a vial, and we have it in a situation where both a health care provider or self-administration is both feasible, possible and will be used. We believe that the vast majority with time that people will use it as self-administration. This is a patient population that's quite used to doing injection. So we think that, that will be able to navigate and that the patients will get access.\n But as you point out, further innovation will be demanded for, and an auto-injector will be critically important. We are doing the studies right now to evaluate how do we provide such an option, and we hope to have those options and those plans more public in the near future. But we agree with you totally in the fact that a future auto-injector will be important. Yes. So I'll take the RSV question. So clesrovimab, we're excited about it. As many of the people know, it's a monoclonal antibody and it's a way to get passive immunity to infants. We think it's really important as we have seen recently. And ours is a single fixed dose and has the durability in terms of covering a whole RSV season, I think, is critically important. And the ability to give this to an infant any time and -- versus, for example, alternative strategies, which is maternal vaccination.\n And then also, we believe that this will be a distinguished monoclonal antibody and it's high barrier to resistance. So we're excited about moving and -- seeing that data and moving with both speed and rigor to get this to the market because we think it will be an important contributor, especially given what we've seen in the RSV season just this past season.\n I do want to just take this one moment to just say it's not just the RSV vaccine that we're very excited. We're also very excited because it's very much in the lay press in our dengue V181, which is a live attenuated tetravalent vaccine. And we're moving with equal eagerness to move that forward into Phase III, as we've already seen data from our colleagues in Institute Butantan about the effectiveness and efficacy of this vaccine.\n But I'll turn it back to Rob."

            "name": "Caroline Litchfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Rob. Good morning. As Rob noted, we have had a strong start to the year with robust growth across our business, which reinforces the confidence we have in our outlook. We are also making strategic investments to leverage leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world, positioning us to continue to deliver long-term value for patients, customers and shareholders. Now turning to our first quarter results. Total company revenues were $15.8 billion, an increase of 9% or 12% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The impact from exchange is primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice. \n The following revenue comments will be on an ex-exchange basis. Our human health business continued its momentum with double-digit growth of 13%, driven by oncology and vaccines. Sales in our Animal Health business increased 4% across both companion animal and livestock products. Turning to the performance of our key brands. In oncology, sales of KEYTRUDA grew 24% to $6.9 billion, driven by increased uptake from earlier-stage cancers and continued strong demand from metastatic indications. In the U.S., KEYTRUDA grew across a broad range of tumors. In earlier-stage cancers, the increase was largely attributable to non-small cell lung cancer following the launches of KEYNOTE-671 and KEYNOTE-091.\n In the metastatic setting, we saw strong uptake from the recent launch of KEYNOTE A39 in first-line advanced urothelial cancer. Outside the U.S., KEYTRUDA growth was driven by continued uptake in earlier stage cancers, including high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma as well as continued strong demand from patients with metastatic disease. Inflation-related price increases consistent with market practice in Argentina also contributed to growth. Alliance revenue from Lynparza and Lenvima grew 7% and 10%, respectively. WELIREG sales more than doubled to $85 million, driven by the additional indication following FDA approval of LITESPARK-005 for certain patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma as well as by increased uptake in certain VHL disease-associated tumors.\n Our vaccines portfolio delivered strong growth, led by GARDASIL, which increased 17% to $2.2 billion, driven by global demand. Sales also benefited from the timing of shipments in China and CDC purchasing patterns in the U.S. VAXNEUVANCE sales grew to $219 million, driven by continued uptake of the pediatric indication in the U.S. and ongoing launches in international markets, particularly in Europe. In the U.S., VAXNEUVANCE sales also benefited from CDC purchasing patterns. Sales in our Animal Health business grew 4%. Livestock sales growth was driven by price actions as well as demand for swine and poultry products. Companion animal growth reflects price actions.\n I will now walk you through the remainder of our P&L, and my comments will be on a non-GAAP basis. Gross margin was 81.2%, an increase of 4.3 percentage points driven by reduced royalty rates for KEYTRUDA and GARDASIL, which went into effect at the beginning of this year as well as favorable product mix. Operating expenses decreased 4% to $6.4 billion, a charge of $656 million related to the acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics this quarter was lower than the $1.4 billion of charges a year ago for certain business development transactions. Excluding these charges, operating expenses grew 8%.\n We remain committed to investing appropriately to realize the promise of our expensive early and late phase pipeline and support the promotion of our key growth drivers. Other expense was $87 million. Our tax rate was 16.1%, including the impact from the Harpoon transaction for which no tax benefit was recorded. Taken together, earnings per share were $2.07, which includes a $0.26 negative impact from the charge related to Harpoon.\n Now turning to our 2024 non-GAAP guidance. The operational strength of our business has enabled us to raise and narrow our full year revenue guidance. We now expect revenue to be between $63.1 million and $64.3 billion, reflecting strong year-over-year revenue growth of 5% to 7%, including the negative impact from foreign exchange. At the midpoint of this range, operational strength in our business of approximately $600 million is partially offset by an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $400 million using mid-April rates resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately 3%.\n Our gross margin assumption is now expected to be approximately 81%. Our estimated range of operating expenses is between $25.2 million and $26.1 billion, which does not assume additional significant potential business development transactions. Other expense is expected to be approximately $250 million. Our full year tax rate is unchanged between 14.5% and 15.5%. We assume approximately 2.55 billion shares outstanding. Taken together, we are increasing and narrowing our expected EPS range to $8.53 to $8.65. This is a $0.07 increase at the midpoint despite an incremental headwind from foreign exchange of approximately $0.05 using mid-April rates, resulting in a full year negative impact from foreign exchange of more than $0.30.\n As you consider your models, there are a few items to keep in mind. The increase in our sales guidance is driven by the strong performance across our current product portfolio, led by KEYTRUDA, which continues to experience growth from additional indications and patient demand. For GARDASIL, second quarter ex U.S. growth will be adversely impacted by shipment timing to China. This year, we expect more evenly distributed quarterly shipments to China. Recall, in 2023, we accelerated shipments from the second half to the first half of the year, which primarily impacted the second quarter. Over the near and long term, we remain confident in our ability to protect many more people from HPV-related cancers and drive growth of GARDASIL.\n Sales of LAGEVRIO in the first quarter were driven by an extended wave of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific markets. LAGEVRIO continues to be an important treatment option for certain patients with COVID-19. So we continue to anticipate full year sales to be lower than last year. We are excited to provide a novel treatment option for adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, following the recent FDA approval of WINREVAIR. We are seeing high interest from patient groups and a range of relevant prescribers. We are also making good progress in enabling access.\n Several payers have already established coverage policies consistent with the label and STELLAR study criteria, while others are in the process of developing their policies. As we go forward, we intend to provide an appropriate level of transparency to enable insight into the impact we are having on patients, including prescription data and revenues. In summary, we are confident in a successful launch of WINREVAIR, consistent with our prior expectations and look forward to providing updates on our progress. \n Now turning to capital allocation, where our strategy remains unchanged. We will prioritize investments in our business to drive near- and long-term growth. We will continue to invest in our innovative pipeline, including the initiation of many new late-stage clinical trials across multiple novel candidates, each of which has the potential to meaningfully address important unmet medical needs. We remain committed to our dividend and plan to increase it over time. Adding compelling science to our pipeline through business development remains a high priority. We maintain ample capacity given our strong investment-grade credit rating and cash flow to pursue additional science-driven value-enhancing transactions. We will continue to execute a modest level of share repurchases.\n To conclude, we remain confident in the near- and long-term outlook of our business, driven by the global demand for our innovative medicines and vaccines as well as our exceptional pipeline. Our unwavering commitment to use the power of cutting-edge science to improve the lives of the patients we serve has put us in a position of financial and operational strength. Our excellent execution and continued investments in innovation will enable us to deliver value to patients, customers and shareholders now and well into the future. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Dean. This is Caroline. I'll just add that as we sit here today, we all know there are many, many people around the world that have not received a vaccine to prevent them against, to help protect them from HPV-related cancers. With the possibility of improving upon G9 with a multivalent vaccine, we're hopeful that we can provide further protection, especially for different population groups. And we will price the vaccine appropriately based on the benefit that it will provide. So we're looking forward to continuing to see growth in GARDASIL and see how the science evolves with our clinical programs. Chris, it's Caroline. So in terms of the phasing of GARDASIL, as you pointed out, during 2023, we saw in China an acceleration of the shipment from the second half of the year to the first half of the year, specifically to the second quarter. What that's done is it's provided an actual tailwind to revenue growth in the first quarter for China, but it will provide a headwind more significant in the second quarter. And that's what we've called out.\n As we look at overall growth for GARDASIL, given where we are with the level of vaccinations across the world, given the manufacturing that we have been scaling up, we're confident in our ability to continue to drive growth during 2024. And in 2025, we will see our manufacturing capacity unconstrained so enabling us to further supply and support the market.\n As we've talked in the past, our opportunities for growth are significant as we look to continue to improve on adolescent vaccination rates, as we look to improve upon gender-neutral vaccinations, as we look to really activate the mid-adult segment, but increasingly get to the lower-income and middle-income markets, which will come at a different price point.\n As we sit here today, continue to be confident in the outlook for GARDASIL over both the near and the long term. As we look at the possibility of a single dose of GARDASIL, the study that we are conducting will be a comprehensive study and will take some time to unfold. What we're seeing in the marketplace currently is where certain low-income markets are implementing a single-dose regimen, they are also increasing the numbers of people they are vaccinating by broadening the age cohort or also opting to vaccinate males at this stage. We'll have to be long term how the data plays out with regards to a single dose to ensure that we will price our vaccine based on the benefit that we're bringing and we vaccinate as many people in the world that we can. And Luisa, this is Caroline. At this stage, we are seeing a real acceptance of the value proposition of WINREVAIR in the United States. We're seeing policy for coverage equally across both the Medicare and Medicaid patient population as well as the commercial segment. So as we move forward, we'll look forward to just helping as many patients as we can across all of those segments, irrelevant of their coverage."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Robert Davis",
            "content": "Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We've begun 2024 with continuing momentum in our business. We're harnessing the power of innovation to advance our deep pipeline and are maximizing the impact of our broad commercial portfolio for the benefit of patients. We drove strong growth across key therapeutic areas, executed strategic business development and are now launching a significant new product in the cardiometabolic space while also preparing for the potential approval and launch of 2 additional important candidates in vaccines in oncology. We have significant opportunities ahead of us across all areas of our business, and we're highly focused on realizing them. \n I continue to be inspired by the dedication of our talented global team, which is working tirelessly to bring differentiated medicines and vaccines to patients through seamless scientific, commercial and operational execution. In March, we received FDA approval for WINREVAIR, a first-in-class treatment for adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare progressive and ultimately life-threatening disease. This marks the achievement of a significant milestone for our company. It exemplifies the value of our strategic priorities and demonstrates how our enduring commitment to our purpose is resulting in tangible benefits for patients. \n Just over 2 years since adding WINREVAIR to our pipeline, our attention now turns to the execution of a strong commercial launch where we have already seen prescriptions being written. We see a tremendous opportunity to positively impact the lives of people living with PAH. And further, the importance of this therapy to patients provides us with increased confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Strategic business development focused on the best external science remains an important priority for our company. We've demonstrated that we can leverage our deep discovery prowess to identify important acquisition targets and then add significant value through our powerful clinical research engine, our regulatory expertise and our commercial scale, which together can serve to accelerate development and enable broad global access to important medical discoveries for patients in need. \n Turning to our first quarter results. We achieved strong growth, reflecting robust demand for our innovative portfolio. We're pleased to reflect this momentum in our updated full year guidance, which Caroline will speak to in a moment. Turning to our broader research efforts. We're focused on advancing our expansive and diverse pipeline of leading-edge programs for the benefit of patients. In vaccines, we continue to pioneer new approaches to optimize disease prevention. In HPV, we're building on the foundation set by GARDASIL to further reduce the global burden of certain HPV-related cancers and disease by potentially providing broader protection with a new multivalent HPV vaccine and by generating data to clearly demonstrate whether or not a single dose of GARDASIL-9 provides comparable long-term protection to the approved 3-dose regimen in males and females ages 16 to 26. \n In pneumococcal, we presented additional compelling data for V116, a vaccine that is specifically designed to help protect against the majority of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults ages 65 and older and look forward to its potential approval in June. Each of these programs are platforms where we can provide meaningful protection to broad populations on a global scale. In HIV, in partnership with Gilead, we shared promising data from our revitalized program for a once-weekly combination of islatravir and lenacapavir in the treatment setting. We're actively progressing our comprehensive clinical program, which is focused on both treatment and prevention strategies to meet the evolving needs of the HIV community. \n And in oncology, we initiated several late-stage programs of novel candidates from our diverse pipeline as we work to expand our impact for patients and reinforce our leadership position over the long term. Finally, across our deep pipeline, we have significant clinical momentum in a range of therapeutic areas. Cutting-edge science is at the core of who we are, and I'm confident that Merck is well positioned to deliver the next wave of important innovations and value to patients, shareholders and to all of our stakeholders.\n In summary, our science-led strategy is delivering compelling proof points that we are creating a sustainable innovation engine that with continued clinical success will lead to a more diversified portfolio of growth drivers over the next decade and beyond. I again want to recognize the enormous efforts across our global organization. My confidence is strong and growing, that we are well positioned to build on this momentum and drive patient impact and value creation this year and well into the future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Caroline. Yes. Maybe I can start, Daina, and then Dean can add. Obviously, I would just start by saying we were very pleased with the overall tone and tenor of the discussion coming out of the ACIP meeting. And as you look at what we have with V116, we continue to believe -- if you look at the strength of the data behind that, and we've talked about -- Dean mentioned some of the clinical readouts that have come. But recall, we cover 83% of the serotypes-causing disease in adults. That's 30% higher than PCV20. So it's significant, and that was how it was specifically designed, targeting those serotypes which are most prevalent in adult disease.\n As a result of that, we continue to believe the value proposition of V116 is very compelling. If you look at the cost effectiveness, it's going to be a very cost-effective vaccine. And as a result, I think that's why you started to see the ACIP ask questions about the 50 to 65 age cohort as well as the 65-plus.\n So I don't want to get ahead of the ACIP and their recommendation. But I would say our belief and conviction in the value of the data and the value this vaccine will bring for patients in the pneumococcal space is significant. And I would expect overall that we're going to see broad coverage coming out of the ACIP. And I think there was a second question you had, Daina, about V117. I'll just maybe give a general answer, which is, obviously, if you look at the strategy of V116, it's the same strategy with V117: How do we develop an investigational PCV vaccine that is targeted specifically to those serotypes that cause disease in children, in peds, without hopefully causing untoward effects. And so it's a model that follows that. We've not given any details to the additional serotypes or our thinking. But just understand that if you look at the model of V116, V117 is the same thing in peds. Yes. Maybe, James, I'll start. And thank you for the question. The short answer is, unfortunately, we don't provide product-level guidance. So I don't think we want to get into trying to tell you what we see WINREVAIR as being a contributor in 2024.\n But with that said, I think it's important to make a few points just so you understand how we're seeing it. First of all, we're very excited to provide this novel treatment for patients with PAH. As you know, we think this will be a game changer in that space. We were well prepared for the launch. And I can tell you the launch, although very early, is going well so far. We've seen an increasing number of prescriptions being written. We've seen repeat prescriptions, and that's coming both from the COE space, from the Centers of Excellence, which is about 150 in the United States, as well as from non-COEs, which is a good development.\n We've already begun making shipments to patients' homes. And hopefully, we'll have patients being dosed very soon, if not already.\n And then I think the other thing I'd note is the prescribers as well as the locations are both from the Centers of Excellence and also non-COE. So that's something to note. And then finally, from a payer perspective, we're seeing good access. No real limits. In fact, we already have several payers who have established coverage policies. And I think as Caroline pointed out in the prepared comments, very consistent with the label and what we saw in STELLAR. But the fact that we've seen policies enacted giving coverage to patients already this quickly after launch, we see as a good sign. \n It's obviously early. But everything so far looks quite good. So our confidence in a successful launch has not changed. We continue to see this consistent with our expectations. And as we move forward, we'll give you appropriate level of transparency. But I just want to give flavor, even though we can't give the specific guidance you were asking for. \n Dean, I'll let you take the second part of the question. The new [indiscernible]. Yes. Maybe, Tim, I'll just provide some commentary on your questions on uptake and how much of the patient population this can account for. As we think about uptake of this opportunity, I would first point out that we see really -- it starts with the strength of the clinical data underlying the IO agent itself. So it's more about the confidence they have in KEYTRUDA. And then secondarily, it's about the delivery mechanism, which is important as we think about obviously leveraging the data we have and just the breadth of what KEYTRUDA is.\n But I will tell you that as we think about bringing this forward when we do launch, our goal will be the price appropriately with the goal of driving quick adoption. So we do want to see adoption happen, and we do think you will see it. Obviously, if you look at then the size of the patient population where it could be, just to give you a sense, by 2028, if we look at the patients who are on monotherapy with KEYTRUDA who are using combinations with orals and those who are moving into earlier stages of disease through some of our adjuvant and neoadjuvant areas with KEYTRUDA, that represents about 50% of the patient population at that time. So that is really the addressable market for what we see the subcu offering to be.\n And potentially, we're not foreclosing the opportunity to also look into the metastatic setting and people being given care in institutions as well as those moving outside of the institutions. But obviously, the value to the patient is ease of use, ability to use it outside of the hospital setting. The time and share is obviously less if you're getting a subcu versus an IV. And then from a cost to the health care system, the ability to not have a patient sitting in the chair for as long allowing for more patients to move through, we think, actually drives access and improves the providing of care as well. So we see it both beneficial from a patient perspective and from the provider perspective, and that's why we do think you'll see uptake of this important medicine when we bring it forward. Yes. I appreciate the question. So as you point out, we are very focused on ensuring that patients get access to the medicine. We're very much committed to it. And that's why we do have -- in addition to our normal programs we would run, we do have the access program we run. That program is actually independent of our commercial operations. We don't really report data coming out of that because it's run through a separate foundation and with the goal, frankly, of making sure that patients get medicines there. So that is available. It can be accessed on our website, and we're committed to making sure patients get the medicine. But specifics on that, we're not going to go into. Yes. No. Thanks for the question. And so if I would just kind of, I guess, think a little bit about where we've been in over the last 3 years, a few points I would want to raise. One, I think we've made tremendous progress in a relatively short period of time, and I give all credit to Dean, to our R&D colleagues for what they've been able to do, how they have been able to really move just flawlessly products through our pipeline. It's amazing you think of it now 3 years in, we haven't had really any major failures. The one maybe hiccup with islatravir, but that's coming back. And so I feel very proud of what our colleagues in R&D have been able to do.\n And then I think about from a commercial perspective, from a manufacturing perspective, we're pulling the products through, we're showing value. The fact that we're ready for the launch with WINREVAIR shows how we can build capability very quickly. We did it in KEYTRUDA, we did it in JANUVIA and now we're doing it in WINREVAIR, and we'll do it in new spaces coming forward. So we feel very good about that. So across all elements, R&D, commercial, manufacturing, the business is delivering.\n And so as we sit here today, if our clinical success continues, I think you're going to see us with a more diversified set of growth drivers over time than, frankly, we've had in many years, if ever. And that's very important. And it all is really what leads to the confidence you've heard me express in other settings, that I'm increasingly less focused on 2028. And I would remind you, by the way, it's a staggered LOE. So it's 2028 in the U.S.; in China, it's 2031; in Europe, in 2032 and in Japan. So it's not a one-moment event. It actually happens over time.\n But that being said, as you've heard me say, I see it is more of a hill than a cliff. And my confidence that we're going to come back with fast growth after that is very high. And we're very focused on the sustainable engine from 2030 to 2040 at this point. So I feel good about where we are, but I just want to reinforce it's a team effort, and I've been left with a great team."
