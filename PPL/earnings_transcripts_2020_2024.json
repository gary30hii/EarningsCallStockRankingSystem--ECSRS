[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. Our presentation and earnings release, which we will discuss during today\u2019s call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some - of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our 2020 year-end earnings call today. With me as usual are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility Business; and Phil Swift who heads up our U.K. utility business. Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of our 2020 performance as we overcame the difficult challenges of COVID-19. I'll also share a few updates on regulatory and ESG matters. Later Joe will provide a more detailed overview of year-end and fourth quarter financial results. I'll then share some closing thoughts on our key focus areas for 2021 and as always we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. Turning to Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of how people performed in 2020. A year unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes. It was a year that tested our resolve our resilience and our ability to adapt very quickly to dynamic conditions. Importantly we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10.5 million customers when it mattered the most. This included the hospital workers and the first responders who were on the front line. And it included customers whose homes became offices whose kitchens and bedrooms became classrooms and who are counting on us to deliver without fail. We're extremely honored that our continued operational excellence resulted in further recognition from these very same customers in 2020. In the U.S., we earned three new J.D. Power Awards for customer satisfaction bringing our total to 54 since J.D. Power surveys began. This included topping all large utilities in the east for the ninth straight year for residential customer satisfaction and in all midsize utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction. In the U.K. at the end of 2020, we again finished with scores of over 9 out of 10 in all four of our DNO and are on track to receive the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem\u2019s Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction. We also received the U.K.\u2019s Customer Service Excellence Award for the 28th time since 1992. As we focused on our commitment to provide a superior customer experience, we also recognize the need to support our local community and assist customers struggling with COVID-19. With that in mind, we continue to offer payment assistance programs, flexible payment options and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills. Shifting to our financial performance, we achieved financial results that are within our original earnings guidance range despite the challenges of COVID-19. This achievement included overcoming a $0.12 per share unfavorable impact in COVID due primarily to low sales volumes in the U.K. and lower commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky, as well as a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact due to mild weather compared to normal conditions. We were able to offset some of the impact through effective cost management and several other factors without negatively impacting the long-term strength of the business. And as we\u2019ve discussed previously the U.K. regulatory construct provides recovery for any under collected revenues from lower sales volumes, which was a significant portion of the 2020 impact. We also maintained a strong financial position and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareowners, something PPL has done each quarter for 75 consecutive years. Turning to Slide 5, as we dealt with the challenges of COVID-19 during the year we also remained very focused on the future. Building on the $27 billion we had invested over the prior decade to improve service to our customers, during 2020 we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in line with the original expectations we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. The vast majority of this investment nearly 90% was focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy. Shifting to a few sustainability highlights, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020. At the outset of the year we set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal and throughout the remainder of the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and a large scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future. In Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100 megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy solutions. We also continue to expand customer participation in our solar share program to carrying full subscription for two additional phases of solar share construction that will begin this spring. In addition our Safari Energy business also added more than 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio increasing its own capacity to 110 megawatt. This new capacity is all contracted be a long-term power purchase agreements. And in August we joined a five-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low carbon energy technology and advance affordable pathways to economy wide decarbonization. We recognize that going even further faster than the goals that we've set to address climate change requires new ideas, technology and systems that can be delivered safely, reliably and affordably. That's why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new low carbon resources Initiative. As part of our sustainability efforts we also remained focused on advancing a culture of diversity equity and inclusion across PPL in supporting meaningful change and progress in the communities we serve. To build on PPL\u2019s prior momentum in this area, the company adopted a new enterprise wide DEI strategy with five supporting DEI commitments. In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in 2020 PPL led focused discussions with our employees and in our communities on race and social justice that will continue to guide our efforts moving forward. In addition, we provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program that aims to award a $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles. As a reflection of PPL\u2019s continuous focus on embracing diversity inclusion and advancing equity for all, we were named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation once again earning a perfect score. Lastly on this slide, I would note that we continue to enhance our ESG disclosures in 2020, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transparency and to keeping stakeholders informed. This included our disclosures around political spending in area in which the Center for Political Accountability and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research, today PPL their trendsetter ranking on the CPA Zicklin Index. Turning to Slide 6 for some regulatory updates. In November we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investments that benefit our customers. LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25th seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates. The requested increases will support continued modernization of a grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&Es natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. In addition, we are seeking approval for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, faster electric vehicle charging stations, and an updated net metering tariff. If approved by the commission, LG&Es and KU\u2019s requested revenue increases would take effect July 1, 2021. Given the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval of $53 million economic release or credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022. In addition, we have proposed to implement AMI in a manner which based on current projections will not require an increase in the combined revenue of LG&E and KU in this rate case or in the future as operating cost savings are projected to more than offset the incremental capital cost of the project. Additionally, pending the outcome of the proceeding it's our goal not to request another base rate adjustment for several years. A detailed procedural schedule for the rate case is available in the appendix of today's presentation. In other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7th issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of a 1,000 megawatts of coal fired generation during this decade. LG&E and KU\u2019s Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024, while Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. We've also included in the appendix a slide that details the projected economic lives of our Baseload generation plant. Utilities are seeking 300 megawatts to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025to 2028. And additionally we're asking for proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage. Proposals are due March 31 and we anticipate making a decision by mid-2021 and potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022. Lastly in the U.K., Ofgem issued its RIIO-ED2 sector specific methodology decision in mid-December. The decision was largely in line with our expectations and underscores the vital role DNOs will play in supporting decarbonization in U.K. to achieve a net zero economy. In January, WPD became the first DNO to issue a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2. That draft plan proposes \u00a36 billion in new investments to support decarbonization digitalization and enhance network utilization. Turning to Slide 7 and the 2021 to 2025 capital plan we've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued monetization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future. This forecast spending represents a $1 billion of incremental CapEx from 2021 to 2024 compared to our prior plan. Those increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of its advanced metering infrastructure $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization smart grid technology and the customer experience. And $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19 additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan. At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. PPL delivered fourth quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Weather in the quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to 2019 as our Kentucky segment experienced slightly milder temperatures. The estimated impact of COVID on our fourth quarter results was about $0.02 per share, $0.01 to the lower U.K. sales volumes and $0.01 driven by lower demand in Kentucky. We continue to experience improvement in this area as C&I demand steadily improves across our service territories. These headwinds were more than offset by positive impacts from returns on additional capital investments lower O&M expenses that are domestic utilities and a higher realized foreign currency exchange rate in the U.K. Overall these results were in line with our expectations. Moving to our full-year 2020 earnings results on Slide 10, we achieved 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year ago. As Vince mentioned earlier our 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19. During 2020, we also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019 primarily in Kentucky. In terms of dilution for the year we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019. Moving to the segment drivers excluding impacts from weather and dilution our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period with 2020 average rates of a $1.47 per pound compared to a $1.32 per pound in 2019. In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and other factors that were not individually significant. Turning to our Kentucky segment we earned $0.57 per share in 2020, a $0.03 increase over comparable results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to a higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019 and lower operation and maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these items were lower commercial industrial demand revenue primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher depreciation expense. Results of Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other primarily included lower overall corporate expenses and other factors not individually significant. Turning to Slide 11, we outlined the trends we observed in weather normalized sales for each segment by customer class since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, lower demand in the C&I sectors continue to be partially offset by higher residential loan in each of our service territories. We also experienced a steady recovery in the C&I space as certain restrictions were eased during the year. In Pennsylvania, residential usage steadily declined following the sharp spike we experienced at the onset of COVID it remains up about 3.5% compared to last year, signaling strong demand from customers still working from home. As for the C&I sector, we saw incremental recovery from the lows experienced in the second quarter and by year end we're tracking less than 3% behind prior year levels. The largest declines remain primarily in the retail trade and services industry, which we expect will remain depressed until restrictions are lifted. In Kentucky, residential usage was up about 70% in Q4 compared to last year consistent with what we experienced in Q3. We continue to experience a moderate recovery in the C&I sectors in Kentucky up substantially from the second quarter. C&I volumes were down 3.5% from last year's usage in Q4 which was an improvement from the 7% decline observed during Q3. Similar to Pennsylvania, the largest declines in the C&I sector continue to be seen in the services industry. However sales to the manufacturing sector returned closer to the 2019 levels in Q4. Finally in the U.K., residential usage also remained higher with volumes being up about 6% compared to last year. Recovery in the U.K. C&I sectors has lagged our domestic jurisdictions overall, but has continued to make a strong comeback down about 9% versus the prior year. A substantial improvement from the second quarter lows of over 20%. Well additional incremental lockdowns were put in place during the fourth quarter. These impacts did not restrict the construction and housing industries and we have not seen a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors. And as a reminder any revenue shortfall in the 2020-2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022-2023 regulatory year adjusted for inflation. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. Before I briefly highlight our 2021 strategic priorities, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of what we were able to achieve in 2020 under truly remarkable circumstances. Operationally, we didn't miss a beat delivering very strong results. Financially, we overcame stiff headwinds to achieve our earnings guidance and return the capital to shareowners. Internally, I saw our businesses collaborate like never before as we work to keep each other safe and tackle COVID-19. And at the end of the day I truly believe we made a positive impact on society and that's the common purpose that really unites employees at all levels across PPL. In 2020, we demonstrated PPL\u2019s tremendous resilience and agility. And as I've shared with our employees, I truly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before. With that in mind, our clear focus moving forward is on delivering long-term value for our customers and our shareowners. In 2021, that includes completing the process to sell our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S. focused utility company. I'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD remains on track and we continue to expect to announce the transaction in the first half of this year. As we shared previously, we believe a sale of the U.K. business will simplify our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance the company's long-term earnings growth rate. In addition, we believe it will give the company greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions. Another top priority of ours this year is as always delivering electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably. No job we do is more important than that. And this year we will remain focused on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking and best practice sharing as we seek to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide a superior customer experience. Other notable priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL\u2019s carbon footprint further enhancing the DEI culture I spoke about earlier and building strong communities through philanthropy, volunteerism and customer assistance. In conclusion, as we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity we have to reposition PPL for future success, and I'm confident we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers, our share owners and the communities we serve. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thanks so much for the time, a couple of things. First question let me pick up where you just left that conversation off. How do you think about strategic opportunities in terms of the size, right? Realistically we've seen some developments today and otherwise so how do you think about the scale of the transformation that you guys were thinking about in reusing those proceeds, right? Could they exceed the size of those proceeds just to kind of put some perhaps parameters or additional parameters around that and then I got a more detailed follow-up?\nVince Sorgi: Yes Julien on that point I really don\u2019t want to speculate on potential M&A scenarios or hypothetical M&A type scenarios. So just don't think it's appropriate to get into that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right, but maybe - I\u2019ll simplify this. It doesn't need to be limited by the use of - use of cash proceeds here right? There is a lot of things you'll look at et cetera.\nVince Sorgi: I mean again I don't want to talk about any specific\u2026\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, fair enough.\nVince Sorgi: I was - okay.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes sorry. It felt evident to ask you. Secondly, if I can you guys described a number of potential opportunities here tied to developments in Kentucky. I just wanted to clarify. How do you think about ownership of those investments right just the process assumptions et cetera? Can you walk through that a little bit I know that the process is underway, but can you speak to your sense of confidence?\nVince Sorgi: Yes Julien, just to clarify which assets are you referring to\u2026\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just the opportunities that emerge out of the co-retirements in Kentucky?\nVince Sorgi: Yes and I'll ask Paul to maybe comment on kind of what we're thinking there. Certainly the - as we're looking at what's happening at the federal level and with the Biden administration, right it's still early yet in terms of you know anything specific coming out of the Biden administration. But I think it's clear that they intend to make policy addressing climate change right a priority. And so, we will certainly continue to remain engaged with the administration on their goals to advance some of those policies. Obviously rejoining the Paris agreement will certainly lead to more aggressive U.S. carbon reduction commitments either 2030/2035 remains to be seen there. That - the targets that are being discussed there certainly would require advancements in technology to be able to achieve those as it's really not feasible today from our industry to really be net zero by 2035 which is what they're talking about. So we'll continue to discuss these challenges with the administration as we're engaging with EI and every and other industry groups. And we'll continue to do that to support what we think is the most efficient way to accomplish those goals. As the industry has been supportive of the overall goals, we don't quite have agreement on how to get there and the ability of the industry to meet those aggressive targets. But Paul, do you want to talk about maybe how we're kind of thinking about things in Kentucky recognizing that it's pretty early in the game.\nPaul Thompson: Sure. I think I would point out as you may know, but point out that what we will need to be doing as we have in the past is whatever actions we would be proposing that we would need to demonstrate - that it's the lowest most reasonable cost initiative. And so, in that to your question, we will certainly be looking at the bill versus the buy opportunities that we have. And it will be incumbent upon us then to put forward a good case to the public service commission on actions moving forward. So I think in that construct of demonstrating the lowest most reasonable cost that\u2019s the way we'll have to operate and we've done that well in the past. And I expect that to happen again here in the future.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So in summary - it\u2019s a little early on this update.\nPaul Thompson: Absolutely, as Vince indicated it's the first quarter - end of the first quarter where we'll get responses back as you may have seen our information put out on coal retirements was the latter part of the decade. So yes, we're still early on for sure.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Durgesh, I think your line is muted.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just - one quick clarification, did the Pennsylvania rate base growth is that lower versus your previous disclosure and if so, why?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, Durgesh in terms of the overall investment in the PA business as we've indicated we are - we have added on a like-for-like basis additional capital in the plan. I think what you might be seeing is the effect of 2021\u2019s capital plan versus 2025\u2019s capital plan. And so we were at $3.2 billion of spend this year and the current plan has about $2.7 billion in 2025. So you'll see a little bit of an impact on the growth rate likely as a result of that. But plan-over-plan as we've talked about we only include known projects in our capital budgets and as we've said historically as we execute the plan we tend to find additional capital and overall including the U.K. we added about a $1 billion of incremental capital plan-over-plan. So specific to your growth question it could be just the larger number dropping off versus the 2025 number coming in.\nDurgesh Chopra: So I guess essentially it's allocating more capital towards Kentucky and Pennsylvania is a larger base, right. Is that - sort of what I heard, like your starting point in Pennsylvania is a larger base and then - going forward there's higher share of capital towards Kentucky?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, I think that's right.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay perfect, thank you. And then you did say there are additional opportunities that you identify as you sort of firm up the plans. So that's clear. Just any color wins on the U.K. sale process. I mean are you still in discussion phases? Is that is that fair to assume here or just any sort of update since the last call we had?\nVince Sorgi: Yes no real updates Durgesh. I would just say that as you can appreciate, this is a very competitive and confidential process. So not really in a position to provide additional details regarding the specific process as I indicated in my opening remarks. The process is continuing to progress as we would have expected and again we continue to expect to announce something in the first half of this year.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fleishman: Vince, couple questions maybe at least one of them you can answer. Just on the - you first talked about selling the U.K. business you did talk about the idea of - despite just selling it for cash. The potential may be like asset swaps being part of it. Is that still on the table potentially or is that less likely now?\nVince Sorgi: Well I would just - unfortunately I don't think that's what one I may be able to get into a lot of detail on Steve\u2026\nSteven Fleishman: Okay.\nVince Sorgi: Just given where we are in the process, I just don't think\u2026.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay.\nVince Sorgi: It's appropriate at this stage to get into any details certainly on what - potential buyers are bidding yes.\nSteven Fleishman: Second question that I think you might be able to answer. So at some point you are going to announce an outcome of this.\nVince Sorgi: Right.\nSteven Fleishman: Can you just remind us - expected timing for like how long from announcement to closing to know to actually get the money if you're getting money? My recollection is you've talked about it being pretty fast in the U.K. but can you just maybe give us a little sense of that process after - once you have announced whatever you're announcing?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, it\u2019s certainly quicker in the U.K. than it is in the U.S. We do have a few required approvals that we will need to get as part of this process that we didn\u2019t need to get when we acquired Central Network. So I think I had indicated in the past that we had closed that transaction from announcement to signing in about 30 days. I wouldn\u2019t expect us to be able to close this transaction that quickly, but it will still be within just a few months. It\u2019s not going to be significantly beyond that.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay.\nVince Sorgi: We wouldn't expect it to be anyway.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then I guess just in thinking about in terms of use of proceeds, I guess, the - you\u2019re going to suddenly have in theory if its cash, a lot of cash to use just is there. Are you willing to just sit on cash for a while if you need to or just how are you thinking about timing of putting money to work?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, so let me just reiterate kind of the four main areas that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of deploying the use of proceeds and then I'll ask Joe maybe to talk about timing. But the first of those which we've been pretty clear about is strengthening the balance sheet and again that would be geared towards targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt metric out of the gate and then you know having our Holdco debt below 30% of our total debt position. The second is really directly supporting future rate based growth whether that's via organic with our current utilities or through other investment opportunities in rate regulated assets here in the U.S. The third is potentially investing in renewables as our tax position could change post sale. We've talked about that as well. So the renewable position could be in a better competitive spot post sale. And then the fourth is really potentially returning capital to our shareholders. But in terms of sitting on the cash, Joe why don\u2019t you talk about kind of how we think about timing of executing those? And again those are - Steve, those are all levers that we can pull. We really won't know which of those and how much of any of those we would actually execute on until we know what the quantum of proceeds are and then ultimately what the use of proceeds will be, but Joe anything you want to add on that?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, I think that's right. The only thing I would add Steve is that we'll have to look at from a timing perspective on the opportunities in each of those areas that Vince highlighted. And then certainly we want to be disciplined and efficient in whichever - which one, every one of those we're pursuing. So, I don't have a perfect answer for you on the time required, but certainly efficiency on our part and as always our disciplined approach to these things will be drivers of that timing.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Good morning, Vince. Good morning Joe. If I can just follow-up on maybe Steve\u2019s question. If I think about year from now the 4Q 2021 earnings call slide deck, do you think PPL has fully completed the transition by then or do you think that - the 2022 was a transition year for PPL?\nVince Sorgi: Well, I really don't want to speculate on that at this point Anthony like certainly we will be looking to maximize the use of proceeds to really maximize the shareholder value there, right. And whether that entails something on the buy side here in the U.S. or renewables or efficiently deploying it to the balance sheet that all remains to be seen. So I think it's really hard for us to indicate today what that 12/31/2021 deck is going to look like. But we will probably have a better sense of that when we get closer to execution of the deal. But at this point I think - visibility into that not quite clear.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And I guess just one last follow-up and I apologize if you hit this before. Just I believe you're mentioning is it $400 million of AMI investment in Kentucky. I guess is that included in your CapEx. And I think previously maybe AMI and maybe my jurisdictions wrong was very challenging in Kentucky. Has that been resolved?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, so of the $400 million increase in the capital plan that we have for Kentucky, $325 million of that is for the AMI investment. So yes the AMI is in our updated capital plan. We are taking a slightly different approach to the CPCN for this project. Paul, do you want to maybe just touch upon how we're thinking about deploying AMI?\nPaul Thompson: Sure, first of all I would say that yes a few years ago we were denied the AMI application for CPCN that we put forward with the commission allowing us to and asking us to do some more piloting and then suggesting that we can come back in. We have done all that. We have built what we believe to be a pretty solid business case for providing opportunities and cost benefit to customers. To Vince's point the approach that we're taking on this is. As part of the rate case and the CPCN not having that capital go into the rate base, but rather have a AFUDC treatment so that over time the O&M savings that we're projecting to the customers are effectively paying for that capital. So the basics though of the case that we think - that we are putting forward. We think it's very strong and so we're very hopeful that the commission will rule in the positive on that case.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great, just want to thank everybody for joining the call today and stay safe out there with this winter weather depending on where you are. Thanks everyone for joining.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our 2020 year-end earnings call today. With me as usual are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility Business; and Phil Swift who heads up our U.K. utility business. Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of our 2020 performance as we overcame the difficult challenges of COVID-19. I'll also share a few updates on regulatory and ESG matters. Later Joe will provide a more detailed overview of year-end and fourth quarter financial results. I'll then share some closing thoughts on our key focus areas for 2021 and as always we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. Turning to Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of how people performed in 2020. A year unlike any we've seen in our lifetimes. It was a year that tested our resolve our resilience and our ability to adapt very quickly to dynamic conditions. Importantly we provided electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to more than 10.5 million customers when it mattered the most. This included the hospital workers and the first responders who were on the front line. And it included customers whose homes became offices whose kitchens and bedrooms became classrooms and who are counting on us to deliver without fail. We're extremely honored that our continued operational excellence resulted in further recognition from these very same customers in 2020. In the U.S., we earned three new J.D. Power Awards for customer satisfaction bringing our total to 54 since J.D. Power surveys began. This included topping all large utilities in the east for the ninth straight year for residential customer satisfaction and in all midsize utilities in the Midwest for both residential and business customer satisfaction. In the U.K. at the end of 2020, we again finished with scores of over 9 out of 10 in all four of our DNO and are on track to receive the maximum incentive reward under Ofgem's Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction. We also received the U.K.'s Customer Service Excellence Award for the 28th time since 1992. As we focused on our commitment to provide a superior customer experience, we also recognize the need to support our local community and assist customers struggling with COVID-19. With that in mind, we continue to offer payment assistance programs, flexible payment options and referral services to help customers manage their energy bills. Shifting to our financial performance, we achieved financial results that are within our original earnings guidance range despite the challenges of COVID-19. This achievement included overcoming a $0.12 per share unfavorable impact in COVID due primarily to low sales volumes in the U.K. and lower commercial and industrial demand in Kentucky, as well as a $0.05 per share unfavorable impact due to mild weather compared to normal conditions. We were able to offset some of the impact through effective cost management and several other factors without negatively impacting the long-term strength of the business. And as we've discussed previously the U.K. regulatory construct provides recovery for any under collected revenues from lower sales volumes, which was a significant portion of the 2020 impact. We also maintained a strong financial position and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareowners, something PPL has done each quarter for 75 consecutive years. Turning to Slide 5, as we dealt with the challenges of COVID-19 during the year we also remained very focused on the future. Building on the $27 billion we had invested over the prior decade to improve service to our customers, during 2020 we completed more than $3 billion in infrastructure improvements in line with the original expectations we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. The vast majority of this investment nearly 90% was focused on transmission and distribution infrastructure to strengthen grid resilience, incorporate new technology and advance our clean energy strategy. Shifting to a few sustainability highlights, we continue to advance our clean energy strategy in 2020. At the outset of the year we set a more aggressive carbon reduction goal and throughout the remainder of the year, we invested in our networks to enable increased electrification and a large scale additions of distributed energy resources in the future. In Kentucky, we secured regulatory approval for a 100 megawatt solar power purchase agreement to meet increasing customer demand for clean energy solutions. We also continue to expand customer participation in our solar share program to carrying full subscription for two additional phases of solar share construction that will begin this spring. In addition our Safari Energy business also added more than 90 megawatts of solar capacity to its portfolio increasing its own capacity to 110 megawatt. This new capacity is all contracted be a long-term power purchase agreements. And in August we joined a five-year industry initiative to accelerate the development of low carbon energy technology and advance affordable pathways to economy wide decarbonization. We recognize that going even further faster than the goals that we've set to address climate change requires new ideas, technology and systems that can be delivered safely, reliably and affordably. That's why we're partnering with EPRI and GTI on their new low carbon resources Initiative. As part of our sustainability efforts we also remained focused on advancing a culture of diversity equity and inclusion across PPL in supporting meaningful change and progress in the communities we serve. To build on PPL's prior momentum in this area, the company adopted a new enterprise wide DEI strategy with five supporting DEI commitments. In the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others in 2020 PPL led focused discussions with our employees and in our communities on race and social justice that will continue to guide our efforts moving forward. In addition, we provided initial contributions to support local organizations focused on DEI initiatives and launched a new scholarship program that aims to award a $1 million over the next decade to support minorities and females pursuing careers in engineering, IT, technical and trade roles. As a reflection of PPL's continuous focus on embracing diversity inclusion and advancing equity for all, we were named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation once again earning a perfect score. Lastly on this slide, I would note that we continue to enhance our ESG disclosures in 2020, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to transparency and to keeping stakeholders informed. This included our disclosures around political spending in area in which the Center for Political Accountability and the Zicklin Center for Business Ethics Research, today PPL their trendsetter ranking on the CPA Zicklin Index. Turning to Slide 6 for some regulatory updates. In November we took steps at our Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky utilities businesses to support continued infrastructure investments that benefit our customers. LG&E and KU filed rate requests with the Kentucky Public Service Commission on November 25th seeking approval for a combined revenue increase of about $331 million in electricity and gas base rates. The requested increases will support continued modernization of a grid to strengthen grid resilience as well as upgrades to LG&Es natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability. In addition, we are seeking approval for full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, faster electric vehicle charging stations, and an updated net metering tariff. If approved by the commission, LG&Es and KU's requested revenue increases would take effect July 1, 2021. Given the COVID pandemic and in an effort to reduce the near-term impact of the rate adjustment for our customers, we sought to minimize the size of the requested increase and have included in our request for approval of $53 million economic release or credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustment until mid-2022. In addition, we have proposed to implement AMI in a manner which based on current projections will not require an increase in the combined revenue of LG&E and KU in this rate case or in the future as operating cost savings are projected to more than offset the incremental capital cost of the project. Additionally, pending the outcome of the proceeding it's our goal not to request another base rate adjustment for several years. A detailed procedural schedule for the rate case is available in the appendix of today's presentation. In other notable Kentucky updates, LG&E and KU on January 7th issued a request for proposal for generation capacity to meet a potential energy shortfall that may be created by the anticipated retirements of a 1,000 megawatts of coal fired generation during this decade. LG&E and KU's Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024, while Mill Creek Unit 2 and EW Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired by 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. We've also included in the appendix a slide that details the projected economic lives of our Baseload generation plant. Utilities are seeking 300 megawatts to 900 megawatts of capacity beginning in 2025to 2028. And additionally we're asking for proposals for at least 100 megawatts of battery storage. Proposals are due March 31 and we anticipate making a decision by mid-2021 and potentially filing for regulatory approvals in early 2022. Lastly in the U.K., Ofgem issued its RIIO-ED2 sector specific methodology decision in mid-December. The decision was largely in line with our expectations and underscores the vital role DNOs will play in supporting decarbonization in U.K. to achieve a net zero economy. In January, WPD became the first DNO to issue a draft business plan for RIIO-ED2. That draft plan proposes \u00a36 billion in new investments to support decarbonization digitalization and enhance network utilization. Turning to Slide 7 and the 2021 to 2025 capital plan we've outlined more than $14 billion from 2021 to 2025 to support continued monetization of our transmission and distribution networks and to advance a cleaner energy future. This forecast spending represents a $1 billion of incremental CapEx from 2021 to 2024 compared to our prior plan. Those increases include $400 million in Kentucky to support full deployment of its advanced metering infrastructure $300 million in Pennsylvania for additional transmission investments as well as incremental funding for IT initiatives focused on digital transformation investments in work optimization smart grid technology and the customer experience. And $200 million in the U.K. due to a shift of certain investments from 2020 to 2021 as a result of COVID-19 additional funding for telecommunications projects and updates to our RIIO-ED2 capital plan. At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed review of our fourth quarter and year-end financial results. Joe? Thank you, Joe. Before I briefly highlight our 2021 strategic priorities, I just want to reiterate how proud I am of what we were able to achieve in 2020 under truly remarkable circumstances. Operationally, we didn't miss a beat delivering very strong results. Financially, we overcame stiff headwinds to achieve our earnings guidance and return the capital to shareowners. Internally, I saw our businesses collaborate like never before as we work to keep each other safe and tackle COVID-19. And at the end of the day I truly believe we made a positive impact on society and that's the common purpose that really unites employees at all levels across PPL. In 2020, we demonstrated PPL's tremendous resilience and agility. And as I've shared with our employees, I truly believe we will emerge from this pandemic stronger and more united than ever before. With that in mind, our clear focus moving forward is on delivering long-term value for our customers and our shareowners. In 2021, that includes completing the process to sell our U.K. utility business and repositioning PPL as a purely U.S. focused utility company. I'm pleased to report that the process to sell WPD remains on track and we continue to expect to announce the transaction in the first half of this year. As we shared previously, we believe a sale of the U.K. business will simplify our business mix, strengthen our balance sheet and enhance the company's long-term earnings growth rate. In addition, we believe it will give the company greater financial flexibility to invest in sustainable energy solutions. Another top priority of ours this year is as always delivering electricity and natural gas safely, reliably and affordably. No job we do is more important than that. And this year we will remain focused on continuous improvement, innovation, benchmarking and best practice sharing as we seek to once again deliver industry-leading operational performance and provide a superior customer experience. Other notable priorities for 2021 include advancing our clean energy strategy and reducing PPL's carbon footprint further enhancing the DEI culture I spoke about earlier and building strong communities through philanthropy, volunteerism and customer assistance. In conclusion, as we look to 2021 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunity we have to reposition PPL for future success, and I'm confident we will continue to deliver long-term value for our customers, our share owners and the communities we serve. With that, operator, let's open the call for questions. Yes Julien on that point I really don't want to speculate on potential M&A scenarios or hypothetical M&A type scenarios. So just don't think it's appropriate to get into that. I mean again I don't want to talk about any specific... I was - okay. Yes Julien, just to clarify which assets are you referring to... Yes and I'll ask Paul to maybe comment on kind of what we're thinking there. Certainly the - as we're looking at what's happening at the federal level and with the Biden administration, right it's still early yet in terms of you know anything specific coming out of the Biden administration. But I think it's clear that they intend to make policy addressing climate change right a priority. And so, we will certainly continue to remain engaged with the administration on their goals to advance some of those policies. Obviously rejoining the Paris agreement will certainly lead to more aggressive U.S. carbon reduction commitments either 2030/2035 remains to be seen there. That - the targets that are being discussed there certainly would require advancements in technology to be able to achieve those as it's really not feasible today from our industry to really be net zero by 2035 which is what they're talking about. So we'll continue to discuss these challenges with the administration as we're engaging with EI and every and other industry groups. And we'll continue to do that to support what we think is the most efficient way to accomplish those goals. As the industry has been supportive of the overall goals, we don't quite have agreement on how to get there and the ability of the industry to meet those aggressive targets. But Paul, do you want to talk about maybe how we're kind of thinking about things in Kentucky recognizing that it's pretty early in the game. Yes no real updates Durgesh. I would just say that as you can appreciate, this is a very competitive and confidential process. So not really in a position to provide additional details regarding the specific process as I indicated in my opening remarks. The process is continuing to progress as we would have expected and again we continue to expect to announce something in the first half of this year. Well I would just - unfortunately I don't think that's what one I may be able to get into a lot of detail on Steve... Just given where we are in the process, I just don't think.... It's appropriate at this stage to get into any details certainly on what - potential buyers are bidding yes. Right. Yes, it's certainly quicker in the U.K. than it is in the U.S. We do have a few required approvals that we will need to get as part of this process that we didn't need to get when we acquired Central Network. So I think I had indicated in the past that we had closed that transaction from announcement to signing in about 30 days. I wouldn't expect us to be able to close this transaction that quickly, but it will still be within just a few months. It's not going to be significantly beyond that. We wouldn't expect it to be anyway. Yes, so let me just reiterate kind of the four main areas that we've talked about in terms of deploying the use of proceeds and then I'll ask Joe maybe to talk about timing. But the first of those which we've been pretty clear about is strengthening the balance sheet and again that would be geared towards targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt metric out of the gate and then you know having our Holdco debt below 30% of our total debt position. The second is really directly supporting future rate based growth whether that's via organic with our current utilities or through other investment opportunities in rate regulated assets here in the U.S. The third is potentially investing in renewables as our tax position could change post sale. We've talked about that as well. So the renewable position could be in a better competitive spot post sale. And then the fourth is really potentially returning capital to our shareholders. But in terms of sitting on the cash, Joe why don't you talk about kind of how we think about timing of executing those? And again those are - Steve, those are all levers that we can pull. We really won't know which of those and how much of any of those we would actually execute on until we know what the quantum of proceeds are and then ultimately what the use of proceeds will be, but Joe anything you want to add on that? Well, I really don't want to speculate on that at this point Anthony like certainly we will be looking to maximize the use of proceeds to really maximize the shareholder value there, right. And whether that entails something on the buy side here in the U.S. or renewables or efficiently deploying it to the balance sheet that all remains to be seen. So I think it's really hard for us to indicate today what that 12/31/2021 deck is going to look like. But we will probably have a better sense of that when we get closer to execution of the deal. But at this point I think - visibility into that not quite clear. Great, just want to thank everybody for joining the call today and stay safe out there with this winter weather depending on where you are. Thanks everyone for joining."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of our fourth quarter results on Slide 9. PPL delivered fourth quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.59 per share compared to $0.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2019. Weather in the quarter was about $0.01 unfavorable compared to 2019 as our Kentucky segment experienced slightly milder temperatures. The estimated impact of COVID on our fourth quarter results was about $0.02 per share, $0.01 to the lower U.K. sales volumes and $0.01 driven by lower demand in Kentucky. We continue to experience improvement in this area as C&I demand steadily improves across our service territories. These headwinds were more than offset by positive impacts from returns on additional capital investments lower O&M expenses that are domestic utilities and a higher realized foreign currency exchange rate in the U.K. Overall these results were in line with our expectations. Moving to our full-year 2020 earnings results on Slide 10, we achieved 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $2.40 per share compared to $2.45 per share a year ago. As Vince mentioned earlier our 2020 financial results reflect an estimated $0.12 unfavorable variance due to COVID-19. During 2020, we also experienced a $0.06 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to 2019 primarily in Kentucky. In terms of dilution for the year we experienced $0.11 per share of dilution year-over-year primarily reflecting the impact of the equity forward settlement in late 2019. Moving to the segment drivers excluding impacts from weather and dilution our U.K. Regulated segment earned $1.33 per share, a $0.01 year-over-year. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins driven by lower sales volumes primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, lower other income due to lower pension income, higher operation and maintenance expense and higher depreciation expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period with 2020 average rates of a $1.47 per pound compared to a $1.32 per pound in 2019. In Pennsylvania, we earned $0.65 per share which was $0.07 higher than our results in 2019. Our Pennsylvania results were primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower operation and maintenance expense. These increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense and other factors that were not individually significant. Turning to our Kentucky segment we earned $0.57 per share in 2020, a $0.03 increase over comparable results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to a higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019 and lower operation and maintenance expense. Partially offsetting these items were lower commercial industrial demand revenue primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher depreciation expense. Results of Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other primarily included lower overall corporate expenses and other factors not individually significant. Turning to Slide 11, we outlined the trends we observed in weather normalized sales for each segment by customer class since the beginning of the pandemic. Overall, lower demand in the C&I sectors continue to be partially offset by higher residential loan in each of our service territories. We also experienced a steady recovery in the C&I space as certain restrictions were eased during the year. In Pennsylvania, residential usage steadily declined following the sharp spike we experienced at the onset of COVID it remains up about 3.5% compared to last year, signaling strong demand from customers still working from home. As for the C&I sector, we saw incremental recovery from the lows experienced in the second quarter and by year end we're tracking less than 3% behind prior year levels. The largest declines remain primarily in the retail trade and services industry, which we expect will remain depressed until restrictions are lifted. In Kentucky, residential usage was up about 70% in Q4 compared to last year consistent with what we experienced in Q3. We continue to experience a moderate recovery in the C&I sectors in Kentucky up substantially from the second quarter. C&I volumes were down 3.5% from last year's usage in Q4 which was an improvement from the 7% decline observed during Q3. Similar to Pennsylvania, the largest declines in the C&I sector continue to be seen in the services industry. However sales to the manufacturing sector returned closer to the 2019 levels in Q4. Finally in the U.K., residential usage also remained higher with volumes being up about 6% compared to last year. Recovery in the U.K. C&I sectors has lagged our domestic jurisdictions overall, but has continued to make a strong comeback down about 9% versus the prior year. A substantial improvement from the second quarter lows of over 20%. Well additional incremental lockdowns were put in place during the fourth quarter. These impacts did not restrict the construction and housing industries and we have not seen a slowdown in operational activity in these sectors. And as a reminder any revenue shortfall in the 2020-2021 regulatory year will be recovered by WPD in the 2022-2023 regulatory year adjusted for inflation. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yes, Durgesh in terms of the overall investment in the PA business as we've indicated we are - we have added on a like-for-like basis additional capital in the plan. I think what you might be seeing is the effect of 2021's capital plan versus 2025's capital plan. And so we were at $3.2 billion of spend this year and the current plan has about $2.7 billion in 2025. So you'll see a little bit of an impact on the growth rate likely as a result of that. But plan-over-plan as we've talked about we only include known projects in our capital budgets and as we've said historically as we execute the plan we tend to find additional capital and overall including the U.K. we added about a $1 billion of incremental capital plan-over-plan. So specific to your growth question it could be just the larger number dropping off versus the 2025 number coming in. Yes, I think that's right. Yes, I think that's right. The only thing I would add Steve is that we'll have to look at from a timing perspective on the opportunities in each of those areas that Vince highlighted. And then certainly we want to be disciplined and efficient in whichever - which one, every one of those we're pursuing. So, I don't have a perfect answer for you on the time required, but certainly efficiency on our part and as always our disciplined approach to these things will be drivers of that timing. Yes, so of the $400 million increase in the capital plan that we have for Kentucky, $325 million of that is for the AMI investment. So yes the AMI is in our updated capital plan. We are taking a slightly different approach to the CPCN for this project. Paul, do you want to maybe just touch upon how we're thinking about deploying AMI?"
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Thompson",
            "content": "Sure. I think I would point out as you may know, but point out that what we will need to be doing as we have in the past is whatever actions we would be proposing that we would need to demonstrate - that it's the lowest most reasonable cost initiative. And so, in that to your question, we will certainly be looking at the bill versus the buy opportunities that we have. And it will be incumbent upon us then to put forward a good case to the public service commission on actions moving forward. So I think in that construct of demonstrating the lowest most reasonable cost that's the way we'll have to operate and we've done that well in the past. And I expect that to happen again here in the future. Absolutely, as Vince indicated it's the first quarter - end of the first quarter where we'll get responses back as you may have seen our information put out on coal retirements was the latter part of the decade. So yes, we're still early on for sure. Sure, first of all I would say that yes a few years ago we were denied the AMI application for CPCN that we put forward with the commission allowing us to and asking us to do some more piloting and then suggesting that we can come back in. We have done all that. We have built what we believe to be a pretty solid business case for providing opportunities and cost benefit to customers. To Vince's point the approach that we're taking on this is. As part of the rate case and the CPCN not having that capital go into the rate base, but rather have a AFUDC treatment so that over time the O&M savings that we're projecting to the customers are effectively paying for that capital. So the basics though of the case that we think - that we are putting forward. We think it's very strong and so we're very hopeful that the commission will rule in the positive on that case."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter 2020 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the investors section of our website. Our presentation and earnings release, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation. I'll now turn the call over to Vince Sorgi, PPL's President and CEO.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter earnings call. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility Business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility Business; and Phil Swift, the Head of our U.K. Electric Distribution Business. Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with brief highlights on third quarter earnings results and our continued strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll share a few updates on regulatory and ESG related matters. And Joe will then provide a more detailed overview of the third-quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, primarily a deferred tax adjustment in the U.K. based on the 2020 Finance Act and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.61 per share a year ago. At a high level, results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. I'll note that the lower earnings compared to last year include $0.02 of lower volumes in the U.K., which will recover in future periods, and $0.01 due to the timing of our estimated federal income tax computation, which will reverse in Q4. Joe will cover the financial results in more detail in his section. Regarding a COVID update, throughout the quarter we continued to deliver strong operational performance, providing outstanding customer service and reliability. At the same time, we've remained focused on innovation and building for the future. In September, we launched the new digitalization strategy in the U.K. The strategy focuses on transforming the way we develop and operate the network, to empower customers, drive greater efficiency and deliver faster decarbonization. And in Pennsylvania, during Q3, we reached the $1 million mark for customer outages avoided as a result of our investments in automated power restoration technology. Regarding customer sales during the quarter, residential load continued to be strong than our weather-normalized forecast, driven by sustained work-from-home measures in all of our service territories. Conversely, C&I demand remained lower in all three business units, albeit less pronounced in Q3 than it had been earlier in the pandemic. From a financial perspective, we are well-positioned to weather the continued economic downturn. We've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts remain steady and our capital plans remain largely intact. And as the moratoria are starting to lift across our U.S. service territories, we will comply with all state utility commission requirements and continue to work with our customers to maintain uninterrupted electricity and gas service. This means offering flexible payment plans, connecting our customers with agencies and programs that can provide assistance and working with them to address overdue balances before they become unmanageable. Service terminations are always a last resort. Overall, we continue to believe the full-year impact of COVID-19 will be manageable as we close out the year. As a result, we've narrowed our forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We continue to expect to track toward the lower end of this guidance range due to the impacts of COVID-19 and warmer than normal weather during the first quarter. Lastly, on the slide, I would note that the U.K. sale process remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of 2021. Moving to Slide 5, and starting with key regulatory developments. On October 1st, WPD responded to Ofgem's RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology consultation, advocating for the continuation of a strong incentive-based regulatory regime that supports the best outcomes for our customers in terms of low prices and high-quality service. We believe RIIO-ED1 largely achieved this balance and that the basic structure of the RIIO-ED1 regime should broadly remain intact under ED2. WPD's response to the consultation focused on several areas, where we believe Ofgem should reconsider its position and the robustness of its supporting evidence before making its methodology decision. In the end, we continue to believe that Ofgem has made it clear that DNOs will be critical to supporting decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. Based on our discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for electric distribution companies. And we expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and beyond. Moving forward, WPD will remain very focused and engaged with its stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure it delivers a plan that will achieve the U.K.'s ambitious carbon reduction goals. Ofgem is expected to issue its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in December. In other U.K. developments, the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA issued a recent provisional ruling that supports more stable returns for regulated utilities in the U.K. to incentivize appropriate levels of investment. The CMA ruling concluded that the water sector regulator, Ofwat, went too far in its efforts to sharply reduce returns for water utilities. We expect the provisional ruling will be one that Ofgem studies closely as it nears its decision on the RIIO-2 final determinations for the gas and electric transmission sectors and ultimately for the electric distribution sector. Turning to the U.S., the FERC on October 15 issued an order in a complaint filed by a third-party challenging PPL Electric Utilities based return on equity for transmission. The FERC order sent the complaint to settlement procedures. If no settlement can be reached, the case will go to public hearing. We continue to believe that PPL Electric Utilities current transmission return on equity is just and reasonable, and that complaint is without merit and based on flawed assumptions and calculations. Also in the U.S. on October 23rd, LG&E and KU notified the KPSC of the company's intent to file a rate request later this month. As part of the rate case, we will be applying for approval to deploy advanced metering to further enhance grid automation and reliability in the state. Assuming the maximum suspension period for such a proceeding, the resulting base rate changes would be effective July 1, 2021. Shifting gears to a few notable highlights related to our sustainability efforts and governance updates. In August, we announced that we joined an exciting new initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon technology. The low carbon resources initiative led by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Gas Technology Institute focuses on identifying, developing and demonstrating affordable pathways to economy-wide de-carbonization. PPL is an anchor sponsor for the five-year program, which supports our clean energy strategy. At a high level, that strategy is focused on de-carbonizing PPL's own generation, de-carbonizing our non-generation operations, enabling third-party de-carbonization and advancing research and development into clean energy technologies. As we've shared previously, PPL has set a goal to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050. We're confident this goal is achievable with today's technology. At the same time, we recognize that going further and faster, we'll require new ideas, new technology and new systems that can be delivered at scale safely, reliably and affordably for those we serve. We also remain squarely focused on diversity, equity and inclusion as part of our long-term corporate strategy. I'm pleased to share that PPL has been named a best place to work for people with disabilities. In July, the company earned a top score of 100% on the 2020 Disability Equality Index, the nation's most comprehensive annual benchmarking tool for disability inclusion. PPL's top score is the result of policies and practices that we've put in place to promote the success of those with disability. And it's just the latest recognition of PPL policies focused on ensuring all employees have the opportunity to succeed. Earlier this year, for example, PPL was named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by The Human Rights Campaign after achieving a perfect score on their corporate equality index. Moving forward, we will continue to work with employee-led affinity groups to better enable all employees to reach their full potential. In other updates, PPL recently earned a trend-setter ranking by the CPA-Zicklin Index, which benchmarks political disclosure and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. We believe it's important to be transparent on these matters, highlighting one of our core values of integrity and openness and our overall compliance and ethics commitment that is supported by robust internal controls. Lastly, PPL's Board of Directors appointed Ar Beattie as a new Director effective October 1st. Ar brings to the Board a wealth of knowledge and experience with regulated utilities and the energy industry and we're certainly glad to have him onboard as we strategically reposition PPL for the future. With that, I'll now turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our third quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I would like to highlight that the estimated impact of COVID on our third quarter results was about $0.04 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. This is less than the $0.06 impact we experienced during the second quarter, primarily due to the improving electricity demand that Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. As a reminder, the majority of this impact is recoverable via the U.K. decoupling mechanism, which adjusts revenues on a two-year lag. Turning to the quarterly walk, starting with the Q3 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first separate the impact of weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the third quarter, we experienced a $0.02 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky. We experienced substantially higher degree days in Kentucky during the third quarter of 2019 that led to a favorable variance last year. Weather in the third quarter of 2020 was about $0.01 favorable overall compared to plan, primarily due to stronger load in Pennsylvania versus normal due to the warmer conditions in July. In terms of dilution, during the third quarter, we continued to recognize the impact of the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts, which resulted in dilution of about $0.03 per share for the quarter. Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K.-regulated segment earnings increased by $0.01 per share compared to a year ago. Factors driving the U.K. earnings results include higher foreign currency exchange rates, compared to the prior period, with Q3 2020 average rates of $1.54 per pound, compared to $1.26 per pound in Q3 2019, and lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest on index-linked debt. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19; lower other income due to lower pension income and higher income taxes. Moving to Pennsylvania. Segment earnings were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q3 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. And as we saw in Q2, our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19 as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment. Results were flat to the comparable results one-year ago. Factors impacting the results include lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 offset by factors that were individually not significant. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 7. We again outlined the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter. And like Q2, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. Demand in the C&I sector was still lower than last year has been steadily recovering as certain COVID restrictions have been lifted. In Pennsylvania, demand improved from about an 11% decline in C&I load in the second quarter to a 4% decline during Q3 compared to a year ago. C&I declines in Pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing, respectively. Our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-COVID operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time. Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky segment reported about a 7% C&I load decline during Q3, compared to the greater than 14% decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year. And like Pennsylvania, the services industry such as restaurants, retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in Kentucky. Much of the improvement we experienced during Q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in Q2. Specifically, industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-COVID levels. Coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected. Finally, in the U.K., C&I load improved to about a 14% decline in the third quarter, compared to a 20% decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago as government restrictions put in place in late March were further eased throughout the month of July. The primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened, albeit not quite the pre-COVID levels. It's clear on this slide that the U.K. demand has not recovered as sharply as our U.S. service territories, which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there. We remain encouraged by the recovery we've observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter, but we'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months, including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns should they arise, such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in England and Wales. At this time, the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options. In addition, strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower C&I demand. Now I know I just stated a lot of percentages. So let me take a moment to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing results in 2020. We experienced a $0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter. 70% of that relates to lower U.K. sales volumes that will be recovered through the U.K. decoupling mechanism. The remaining $0.03 is primarily from lower demand in Kentucky, and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management. Overall, we believe our strong regulatory constructs, balanced rate structures and customer mix, positions PPL well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Joe. In closing, I remain very proud of how our teams across PPL have risen to the challenge of COVID-19. We continue to deliver electricity and gas safely and reliably to our customers. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on innovation and continuous improvement as we position the company for future success. With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Today's first question comes from Ryan Greenwald at BofA. Please go ahead.\nRyan Greenwald: Good morning. I appreciate the time.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning.\nRyan Greenwald: Can you guys just talk about your confidence and conviction levels and how that kind of evolved over the last few months around being able to reach constructive deal terms between the CMA findings and what you're seeing internally? And how are you thinking about additional upcoming Ofgem data points in terms of ability to really further improve sentiment and drive renewed interest?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So as you can appreciate, we are in the middle of a competitive process. So I don't think it's appropriate to get into too much detail in terms of the process that we are currently \u2013 is currently under way. But to your point, I think the CMA decision for the water company, that provisional decision was certainly positive as we think about overall returns in the U.K.-regulated utility sector. I think it should play well into what we would expect for gas and transmission coming here in about a month or so, that should be coming out early December. We also have the government's white paper on decarbonization. That should be coming out. They said autumn, so that could be this month or early December as well. And then, the CMA final decision. So I think to your point, things seem to be progressing in a positive light in the U.K. regulatory construct. And I would expect that to translate positively in our process, but I don't want to get into a lot of detail in terms of where we are with potential bidders.\nRyan Greenwald: Got it. Fair enough. And how are you guys thinking about your hedging strategy ahead of any transaction, corresponding cash proceeds, just given the latest backdrop? I'm curious if you can kind of frame your thoughts around any internal forecast you guys have on the currency over the next several months?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. Joe, you want to talk about that a little bit?\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah. Well, as far as hedging the proceeds of the transaction that is something that we're considering at this time. Nothing really to update at this point, but if and when appropriate, we'll provide an update then. I think how the pound moves here could depend on \u2013 would depend, we think, on our U.S. collection results and which way that goes. So certainly watching the pound closely and giving consideration to hedging.\nRyan Greenwald: Got it. Appreciate the time.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi, team. Good morning. Who do you think is going to win the election? I'm just kidding. Maybe just can you talk about \u2013 you mentioned asset swaps or asset exchange events in the past and Joe \u2013 so maybe just talk about where that stands? And then, in light of that, I do have a follow-up question, but maybe just address that and then I have a follow-up as it relates to sort of possible future M&A.\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Durgesh, I don't think it's appropriate to get into. We're kind of getting into the process now with potential buyers. So just not appropriate to get into any kind of detail around the process.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. That's fair, Vince. Totally understandable. And then, maybe can you talk about just maybe there's \u2013 the reason why I ask is there's, obviously, Center Point earlier today talked about putting one to two gas LDCs in their infrastructure \u2013 in their asset base on market next year. NiSource is another \u2013 one of your peers, has made that commentary. Maybe can you talk about the M&A growth opportunities in the U.S. outside of this whole deal with the U.K.? Just how do you think about potential consolidation opportunities, your views on electric versus gas and geographies that you might be interested in, anything that you can sort of speak to that?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So overall, I would say we are interested in acquiring regulated utilities. We do have a preference toward electric, but electric and gas utilities are also attractive to us. In terms of geography, I'm not sure that that contiguous service territories or anything like that is necessarily something that we put a high emphasis on. So at this point, I would say, we are pretty open to opportunities that may come-up in the market. Again, where \u2013 our base case is fix the balance sheet, not really fix the balance sheet, but improve the balance sheet from where we are to kind of the mid-teens and then share buybacks, right? It would be the kind of the base case as that we would look at M&A as potential to improving value above that. Renewables is also another area that I think we're seriously considering. We did acquire Safari Energy back in 2018, hasn't been a significant component of the PPL earnings profile to date. However, when we come out of the WPD sale we could possibly be a cash taxpayer at that time, which, obviously, would put us in a good position around the renewables business. So I think we have opportunity to organically grow that business given kind of how we've positioned the DER business that we acquired a couple of years ago, but also there could be possibility or potential to do some M&A there as well.\nDurgesh Chopra: Great. Super helpful, Vince. So I'll let others to ask. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Today's next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hi, good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Paul.\nJoe Bergstein: Good morning.\nPaul Patterson: I appreciate you guys are in the middle of the process. And obviously, if \u2013 you can share only what you can share. But can you give us any flavor, I mean, as to sort of the level of interest? I mean, in other words, have there been a lot of people who have been showing interest in the property? And are you \u2013 I mean, you mentioned these regulatory events in the U.K. Are these things that people are looking to see, I guess, before they do \u2013 before they show interest? Or can you give us any flavor as to \u2013 or at least how optimistic you feel about what you've encountered so far?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. I would \u2013 so Paul, I would say that the process and the level of interest is progressing as we would have expected. I did talk about in August when we made the announcement that I did expect there to be quite a bit of interest in WPD, given the quality of the assets, the quality of the management team. And again, we think electric distribution is the premier sector in the utility industry in the U.K. given its role in where it's going to play in the decarbonization efforts to get to net zero in the U.K. So at this point, I would say, nothing that I'm seeing would kind of alter that view. And things are progressing as we had expected.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Hi, good morning. So as the sale process continues to move forward, is there any more color you're able to share around the tax attributes of the portfolio for sale?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. No update at this point. But Joe, I don't know if you want to mention anything on \u2013 thoughts on tax strategy.\nJoe Bergstein: No. Nothing. Nothing to update at this time or any additional details at this time, Ryan. We'll give an update on that when appropriate, but I don't think it's appropriate to do so now given where we are in the process.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then, to follow-up on the comments about being open to gas utility deals, curious about your long-term ESG strategy and your views on decarbonization?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So our stated goals are try to reduce our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, 70% \u2013 at least 70% by 2040. As of 12/31/2019, so as of the end of last year, we've already delivered about a 56% reduction, compared to 2010, and that compares to about a 45% reduction for the sector. So we're feeling very, very good about our transition strategy and the glide path that we're on to achieve that at least 70% by 2040 and at least 80% by 2050. Our reduction targets are, we think they're comparable to our industry peers, even some of those peers that have indicated a net-zero target by 2050, they've indicated that they see a pretty clear path to 80% reduction, but would require incremental technological improvements to get the remaining 20%. And that's very consistent with how we are seeing things as well. It's one of the reasons why we joined the EPRI, GTI, LCRI R&D project over the next five years to really try to identify that technology to actually get to net zero by 2050. Again, as we're thinking about the declining costs of renewable energy, we think there'll be continued opportunity to accelerate decarbonization, even in Kentucky, even without retiring coal plants to the extent that the LCOE of solar continues to come down, it could end up being cheaper than the variable cost of generating in Kentucky. But again, a long-term carbon reduction goals for us is around the retirement of the coal fleet. But we will continue to do that in a very balanced way. We're focused on working with the commission making sure that the power that we continue to generate in the state is affordable and reliable for our customers that is critical. Relatively cheap electric in the State of Kentucky is an important component of their economic development strategy. So again, as we think about our carbon reduction strategy, it's in a very balanced way to make sure that we're keeping our customers and our regulators in mind. And again, we think we are in a good position to balance all of those things. If technology were to improve or the cost curves continue to come down significantly, what we've noticed and experienced in Kentucky is that the commission has been very supportive of coal retirements when it makes economic sense to do so. They are not supportive when it does not make economic sense. Just to remind everybody, we've retired over 1,200 megawatts of coal fire generation since 2010, and that was all based on economics. So we think again, the regulatory construct is supportive down there, but it's all based on economics and as \u2013 right now, the economics are not quite there to accelerate the retirement. But as that continues to progress, certainly, our team in Kentucky is looking at that. We think the commission will continue to be supportive of things like that as well. I think just the key there is to ensure that the generation is reliable and affordable. And again, I think we're in a good position to balance all of those factors.\nRyan Levine: But just a follow-up, I mean, how does adding or potentially adding a gas utility to your portfolio fit within that framework?\nVinceSorgi: Well, I don't want to specifically indicate whether or not we would be interested in just a gas LDC on its own. My preference would be in electric and gas utility. Again, I think over time, gas will be deemphasized as we think about a longer-term carbon transition strategy for the U.S. And so that's why I like electric and gas a little better because you can build in that direct edge for electrification there. But I wouldn't say today that we wouldn't take a look at that.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for the final remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today, and we'll see you all at EEI virtually next week. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Well, thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter earnings call. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility Business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility Business; and Phil Swift, the Head of our U.K. Electric Distribution Business. Moving to Slide 3. I'll begin this morning with brief highlights on third quarter earnings results and our continued strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. I'll share a few updates on regulatory and ESG related matters. And Joe will then provide a more detailed overview of the third-quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, primarily a deferred tax adjustment in the U.K. based on the 2020 Finance Act and unrealized losses on foreign currency economic hedges. Third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.58 per share compared with $0.61 per share a year ago. At a high level, results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. I'll note that the lower earnings compared to last year include $0.02 of lower volumes in the U.K., which will recover in future periods, and $0.01 due to the timing of our estimated federal income tax computation, which will reverse in Q4. Joe will cover the financial results in more detail in his section. Regarding a COVID update, throughout the quarter we continued to deliver strong operational performance, providing outstanding customer service and reliability. At the same time, we've remained focused on innovation and building for the future. In September, we launched the new digitalization strategy in the U.K. The strategy focuses on transforming the way we develop and operate the network, to empower customers, drive greater efficiency and deliver faster decarbonization. And in Pennsylvania, during Q3, we reached the $1 million mark for customer outages avoided as a result of our investments in automated power restoration technology. Regarding customer sales during the quarter, residential load continued to be strong than our weather-normalized forecast, driven by sustained work-from-home measures in all of our service territories. Conversely, C&I demand remained lower in all three business units, albeit less pronounced in Q3 than it had been earlier in the pandemic. From a financial perspective, we are well-positioned to weather the continued economic downturn. We've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion. Our cash receipts remain steady and our capital plans remain largely intact. And as the moratoria are starting to lift across our U.S. service territories, we will comply with all state utility commission requirements and continue to work with our customers to maintain uninterrupted electricity and gas service. This means offering flexible payment plans, connecting our customers with agencies and programs that can provide assistance and working with them to address overdue balances before they become unmanageable. Service terminations are always a last resort. Overall, we continue to believe the full-year impact of COVID-19 will be manageable as we close out the year. As a result, we've narrowed our forecast range to $2.40 to $2.50 per share from the prior range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. We continue to expect to track toward the lower end of this guidance range due to the impacts of COVID-19 and warmer than normal weather during the first quarter. Lastly, on the slide, I would note that the U.K. sale process remains on track, and we continue to expect to announce a transaction in the first half of 2021. Moving to Slide 5, and starting with key regulatory developments. On October 1st, WPD responded to Ofgem's RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology consultation, advocating for the continuation of a strong incentive-based regulatory regime that supports the best outcomes for our customers in terms of low prices and high-quality service. We believe RIIO-ED1 largely achieved this balance and that the basic structure of the RIIO-ED1 regime should broadly remain intact under ED2. WPD's response to the consultation focused on several areas, where we believe Ofgem should reconsider its position and the robustness of its supporting evidence before making its methodology decision. In the end, we continue to believe that Ofgem has made it clear that DNOs will be critical to supporting decarbonization efforts in the U.K. to deliver a net-zero economy. Based on our discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for electric distribution companies. And we expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and beyond. Moving forward, WPD will remain very focused and engaged with its stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure it delivers a plan that will achieve the U.K.'s ambitious carbon reduction goals. Ofgem is expected to issue its RIIO-ED2 sector-specific methodology decision in December. In other U.K. developments, the Competition and Markets Authority or CMA issued a recent provisional ruling that supports more stable returns for regulated utilities in the U.K. to incentivize appropriate levels of investment. The CMA ruling concluded that the water sector regulator, Ofwat, went too far in its efforts to sharply reduce returns for water utilities. We expect the provisional ruling will be one that Ofgem studies closely as it nears its decision on the RIIO-2 final determinations for the gas and electric transmission sectors and ultimately for the electric distribution sector. Turning to the U.S., the FERC on October 15 issued an order in a complaint filed by a third-party challenging PPL Electric Utilities based return on equity for transmission. The FERC order sent the complaint to settlement procedures. If no settlement can be reached, the case will go to public hearing. We continue to believe that PPL Electric Utilities current transmission return on equity is just and reasonable, and that complaint is without merit and based on flawed assumptions and calculations. Also in the U.S. on October 23rd, LG&E and KU notified the KPSC of the company's intent to file a rate request later this month. As part of the rate case, we will be applying for approval to deploy advanced metering to further enhance grid automation and reliability in the state. Assuming the maximum suspension period for such a proceeding, the resulting base rate changes would be effective July 1, 2021. Shifting gears to a few notable highlights related to our sustainability efforts and governance updates. In August, we announced that we joined an exciting new initiative to accelerate the development of low-carbon technology. The low carbon resources initiative led by the Electric Power Research Institute and the Gas Technology Institute focuses on identifying, developing and demonstrating affordable pathways to economy-wide de-carbonization. PPL is an anchor sponsor for the five-year program, which supports our clean energy strategy. At a high level, that strategy is focused on de-carbonizing PPL's own generation, de-carbonizing our non-generation operations, enabling third-party de-carbonization and advancing research and development into clean energy technologies. As we've shared previously, PPL has set a goal to reduce its carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050. We're confident this goal is achievable with today's technology. At the same time, we recognize that going further and faster, we'll require new ideas, new technology and new systems that can be delivered at scale safely, reliably and affordably for those we serve. We also remain squarely focused on diversity, equity and inclusion as part of our long-term corporate strategy. I'm pleased to share that PPL has been named a best place to work for people with disabilities. In July, the company earned a top score of 100% on the 2020 Disability Equality Index, the nation's most comprehensive annual benchmarking tool for disability inclusion. PPL's top score is the result of policies and practices that we've put in place to promote the success of those with disability. And it's just the latest recognition of PPL policies focused on ensuring all employees have the opportunity to succeed. Earlier this year, for example, PPL was named the best place to work for LGBTQ equality by The Human Rights Campaign after achieving a perfect score on their corporate equality index. Moving forward, we will continue to work with employee-led affinity groups to better enable all employees to reach their full potential. In other updates, PPL recently earned a trend-setter ranking by the CPA-Zicklin Index, which benchmarks political disclosure and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. We believe it's important to be transparent on these matters, highlighting one of our core values of integrity and openness and our overall compliance and ethics commitment that is supported by robust internal controls. Lastly, PPL's Board of Directors appointed Ar Beattie as a new Director effective October 1st. Ar brings to the Board a wealth of knowledge and experience with regulated utilities and the energy industry and we're certainly glad to have him onboard as we strategically reposition PPL for the future. With that, I'll now turn it over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe? Thanks, Joe. In closing, I remain very proud of how our teams across PPL have risen to the challenge of COVID-19. We continue to deliver electricity and gas safely and reliably to our customers. At the same time, we remain as focused as ever on innovation and continuous improvement as we position the company for future success. With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A. Good morning. Sure. So as you can appreciate, we are in the middle of a competitive process. So I don't think it's appropriate to get into too much detail in terms of the process that we are currently \u2013 is currently under way. But to your point, I think the CMA decision for the water company, that provisional decision was certainly positive as we think about overall returns in the U.K.-regulated utility sector. I think it should play well into what we would expect for gas and transmission coming here in about a month or so, that should be coming out early December. We also have the government's white paper on decarbonization. That should be coming out. They said autumn, so that could be this month or early December as well. And then, the CMA final decision. So I think to your point, things seem to be progressing in a positive light in the U.K. regulatory construct. And I would expect that to translate positively in our process, but I don't want to get into a lot of detail in terms of where we are with potential bidders. Sure. Joe, you want to talk about that a little bit? Thanks, Ryan. Yes, Durgesh, I don't think it's appropriate to get into. We're kind of getting into the process now with potential buyers. So just not appropriate to get into any kind of detail around the process. Sure. So overall, I would say we are interested in acquiring regulated utilities. We do have a preference toward electric, but electric and gas utilities are also attractive to us. In terms of geography, I'm not sure that that contiguous service territories or anything like that is necessarily something that we put a high emphasis on. So at this point, I would say, we are pretty open to opportunities that may come-up in the market. Again, where \u2013 our base case is fix the balance sheet, not really fix the balance sheet, but improve the balance sheet from where we are to kind of the mid-teens and then share buybacks, right? It would be the kind of the base case as that we would look at M&A as potential to improving value above that. Renewables is also another area that I think we're seriously considering. We did acquire Safari Energy back in 2018, hasn't been a significant component of the PPL earnings profile to date. However, when we come out of the WPD sale we could possibly be a cash taxpayer at that time, which, obviously, would put us in a good position around the renewables business. So I think we have opportunity to organically grow that business given kind of how we've positioned the DER business that we acquired a couple of years ago, but also there could be possibility or potential to do some M&A there as well. Thanks, Durgesh. Good morning, Paul. Yes. I would \u2013 so Paul, I would say that the process and the level of interest is progressing as we would have expected. I did talk about in August when we made the announcement that I did expect there to be quite a bit of interest in WPD, given the quality of the assets, the quality of the management team. And again, we think electric distribution is the premier sector in the utility industry in the U.K. given its role in where it's going to play in the decarbonization efforts to get to net zero in the U.K. So at this point, I would say, nothing that I'm seeing would kind of alter that view. And things are progressing as we had expected. Yes. No update at this point. But Joe, I don't know if you want to mention anything on \u2013 thoughts on tax strategy. Sure. So our stated goals are try to reduce our carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, 70% \u2013 at least 70% by 2040. As of 12/31/2019, so as of the end of last year, we've already delivered about a 56% reduction, compared to 2010, and that compares to about a 45% reduction for the sector. So we're feeling very, very good about our transition strategy and the glide path that we're on to achieve that at least 70% by 2040 and at least 80% by 2050. Our reduction targets are, we think they're comparable to our industry peers, even some of those peers that have indicated a net-zero target by 2050, they've indicated that they see a pretty clear path to 80% reduction, but would require incremental technological improvements to get the remaining 20%. And that's very consistent with how we are seeing things as well. It's one of the reasons why we joined the EPRI, GTI, LCRI R&D project over the next five years to really try to identify that technology to actually get to net zero by 2050. Again, as we're thinking about the declining costs of renewable energy, we think there'll be continued opportunity to accelerate decarbonization, even in Kentucky, even without retiring coal plants to the extent that the LCOE of solar continues to come down, it could end up being cheaper than the variable cost of generating in Kentucky. But again, a long-term carbon reduction goals for us is around the retirement of the coal fleet. But we will continue to do that in a very balanced way. We're focused on working with the commission making sure that the power that we continue to generate in the state is affordable and reliable for our customers that is critical. Relatively cheap electric in the State of Kentucky is an important component of their economic development strategy. So again, as we think about our carbon reduction strategy, it's in a very balanced way to make sure that we're keeping our customers and our regulators in mind. And again, we think we are in a good position to balance all of those things. If technology were to improve or the cost curves continue to come down significantly, what we've noticed and experienced in Kentucky is that the commission has been very supportive of coal retirements when it makes economic sense to do so. They are not supportive when it does not make economic sense. Just to remind everybody, we've retired over 1,200 megawatts of coal fire generation since 2010, and that was all based on economics. So we think again, the regulatory construct is supportive down there, but it's all based on economics and as \u2013 right now, the economics are not quite there to accelerate the retirement. But as that continues to progress, certainly, our team in Kentucky is looking at that. We think the commission will continue to be supportive of things like that as well. I think just the key there is to ensure that the generation is reliable and affordable. And again, I think we're in a good position to balance all of those factors. Well, I don't want to specifically indicate whether or not we would be interested in just a gas LDC on its own. My preference would be in electric and gas utility. Again, I think over time, gas will be deemphasized as we think about a longer-term carbon transition strategy for the U.S. And so that's why I like electric and gas a little better because you can build in that direct edge for electrification there. But I wouldn't say today that we wouldn't take a look at that. Great. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call today, and we'll see you all at EEI virtually next week. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our third quarter segment results on Slide 6. First, I would like to highlight that the estimated impact of COVID on our third quarter results was about $0.04 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the U.K. and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. This is less than the $0.06 impact we experienced during the second quarter, primarily due to the improving electricity demand that Vince mentioned earlier in his remarks. As a reminder, the majority of this impact is recoverable via the U.K. decoupling mechanism, which adjusts revenues on a two-year lag. Turning to the quarterly walk, starting with the Q3 2019 ongoing results on the left, we first separate the impact of weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the third quarter, we experienced a $0.02 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to the third quarter of 2019, primarily in Kentucky. We experienced substantially higher degree days in Kentucky during the third quarter of 2019 that led to a favorable variance last year. Weather in the third quarter of 2020 was about $0.01 favorable overall compared to plan, primarily due to stronger load in Pennsylvania versus normal due to the warmer conditions in July. In terms of dilution, during the third quarter, we continued to recognize the impact of the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts, which resulted in dilution of about $0.03 per share for the quarter. Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K.-regulated segment earnings increased by $0.01 per share compared to a year ago. Factors driving the U.K. earnings results include higher foreign currency exchange rates, compared to the prior period, with Q3 2020 average rates of $1.54 per pound, compared to $1.26 per pound in Q3 2019, and lower interest expense, primarily due to lower interest on index-linked debt. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19; lower other income due to lower pension income and higher income taxes. Moving to Pennsylvania. Segment earnings were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q3 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. And as we saw in Q2, our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19 as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. Turning to our Kentucky-regulated segment. Results were flat to the comparable results one-year ago. Factors impacting the results include lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 offset by factors that were individually not significant. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing, which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 7. We again outlined the changes in weather-normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter. And like Q2, we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors, partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories. Demand in the C&I sector was still lower than last year has been steadily recovering as certain COVID restrictions have been lifted. In Pennsylvania, demand improved from about an 11% decline in C&I load in the second quarter to a 4% decline during Q3 compared to a year ago. C&I declines in Pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing, respectively. Our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-COVID operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time. Moving to Kentucky. Our Kentucky segment reported about a 7% C&I load decline during Q3, compared to the greater than 14% decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year. And like Pennsylvania, the services industry such as restaurants, retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in Kentucky. Much of the improvement we experienced during Q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in Q2. Specifically, industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-COVID levels. Coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected. Finally, in the U.K., C&I load improved to about a 14% decline in the third quarter, compared to a 20% decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago as government restrictions put in place in late March were further eased throughout the month of July. The primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened, albeit not quite the pre-COVID levels. It's clear on this slide that the U.K. demand has not recovered as sharply as our U.S. service territories, which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there. We remain encouraged by the recovery we've observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter, but we'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months, including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns should they arise, such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in England and Wales. At this time, the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options. In addition, strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower C&I demand. Now I know I just stated a lot of percentages. So let me take a moment to summarize the impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing results in 2020. We experienced a $0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter. 70% of that relates to lower U.K. sales volumes that will be recovered through the U.K. decoupling mechanism. The remaining $0.03 is primarily from lower demand in Kentucky, and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management. Overall, we believe our strong regulatory constructs, balanced rate structures and customer mix, positions PPL well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yeah. Well, as far as hedging the proceeds of the transaction that is something that we're considering at this time. Nothing really to update at this point, but if and when appropriate, we'll provide an update then. I think how the pound moves here could depend on \u2013 would depend, we think, on our U.S. collection results and which way that goes. So certainly watching the pound closely and giving consideration to hedging. Good morning. No. Nothing. Nothing to update at this time or any additional details at this time, Ryan. We'll give an update on that when appropriate, but I don't think it's appropriate to do so now given where we are in the process."

Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC Durgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Paul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC Ryan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOperator: Good day and welcome to the PPL Corporation Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig - PPL Corp.: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter 2020 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued earlier today on the Investors section of our website. Our remarks this morning may contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events, including today's announcement to launch a process to sell PPL's UK business. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of our presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements. During the call, we will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations, a non-GAAP measure. For reconciliations to the appropriate GAAP measure, please refer to the appendix of this presentation and our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the UK. Moving to slide 3, I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the UK. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic, and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update, and as always we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. So turning to slide 4, today we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors that we are going to initiate a process to sell our UK business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale which strategically repositions PPL as a purely US utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate regulated assets in the US, and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our long-term earnings growth which could include supporting US asset acquisitions and returning capital to share owners. We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price net of any cash will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post-sale, targeting mid-teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our US utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another US utility we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners. We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high performing management team in the best energy subsector in the UK, i.e. electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the UK will flow through electric distribution. And significant investment will be required in that sector if the UK is going to achieve its net-zero goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business, in fact it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past two decades and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future. And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD in our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the UK and across broader Europe that support our position. Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and US utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD is part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the US, and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company, with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction. Now, let me make some high level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to slide 5, today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share; adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago. Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19, I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably, as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce, or more than 4,500 employees to work from home and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. With health and safety our top priority, these steps remain in place today even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what re-entry to the workplace will look like for those now at home we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations. While the most recent Tropical Storm Isaias impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing again little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. Further, we remain well-positioned from a supply chain perspective and our capital plans remain on track as we've experienced minimal delay, apart from the early lockdown phase in the UK. Finally from a financial perspective we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion, our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt. Turning to a UK regulatory update, we've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about three things in there RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the UK's net zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution. Not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunities for some of that investment to be accrued in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors. WPD is in the fortunate position however to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid-next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful. The sector specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical, to supporting the de-carbonization efforts in the UK, to deliver a net zero economy. And we continue to agree that we're best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement and will continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year. While many other parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net zero related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2. And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year. In a positive sign we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work from home measures, and while C&I is still below plan in all three business units it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be. Regarding 2021 we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the UK business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe?\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our second quarter segment results on slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the UK and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about two-thirds of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the UK decoupling mechanism on a two-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments. Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left. We first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019 primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about a $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the UK and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period of Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we did not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021. Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.10 per share, a $0.03 decrease from our results one year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. Turning to slide 7 we outlined the changes in weather normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed primarily in June substantially reduced the impact on load. For example in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April from more modest declines of 8% and 2% respectively for the month of June. In the UK, we saw some positive momentum as the UK government downgraded its alert level mid-month, although the recovery was more modest with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the UK aligns with our financial statement presentation on a one month's lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we're encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter will remain as good guides as we move through the balance of the year. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thanks, Joe. Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning is one step in that direction. I'm sure our decision to launch the sale process for WPD doesn't come as a surprise to investors given PPL stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate, and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040 and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining costs of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate the carbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers. In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate. With that operator, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today will come from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nUnknown Speaker: Hey, guys. This is (00:21:32) for Shar. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Good morning.\nUnknown Speaker: I guess just sort of following on your comments through, Vince, if we could start at a high level on the sale process, I mean, what gave you and the Board the sense that this is really the time to do this? Kind of why now, is it the internal management, is it external factors like post-Brexit pre-RIIO-ED2 kind of, what were the factors that went into decision?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Sure. So, I think, there's been quite a bit of change actually, right, we've been very transparent with the market and our investors that while we constantly review strategic options to maximize value that we would not engage in M&A unless we thought, right, that it would create value for our shareowners. And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing the sale of WPD will in fact create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up going forward for longer term growth with a stronger balance sheet. In terms of the market backdrop right last year, we had the general election in the UK, (00:22:48) election they failed, renationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO2 process primarily for electric distribution which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to zero kind of flowing through that subsector, so we've got some clarity on all that. Unfortunately that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level you would have expected and in fact the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the UK, electric distribution in the UK and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the UK business and the management team and again the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in the share price.\nUnknown Speaker: Got you. Thanks. And then I guess could you give us a sense of whether there are any market power concerns in the UK, would that preclude some of your neighbors from potentially acquiring the systems and then are you open to selling the WPD regions piecemeal or is it really just a single sale?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. I don't want to get into necessarily specifics on who the names that might be interested or the structures. I think, what we've done today with the announcement has created maximum flexibility around that. So I think you're going to see some creativity on the part of buyers, whether it's cash, a combination of cash and perhaps assets in the US that certainly we will entertain as those they start coming in and we work with JPMorgan on all of that stuff. So at this point, I don't know that that market power would be a top concern, but certainly we'll deal with that if appropriate.\nUnknown Speaker: Got you. Thanks. And then just one quick one state side. Can you give us any updates on Project Compass, is there any movement there?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: No, that's \u2013 we pretty much stopped working actively on Compass.\nUnknown Speaker: Cool. That's good to hear. Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the announcement and thanks for taking my questions.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from the Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, team. Congrats on the potential transactions with that.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. Thank you.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I wanted to follow up here with a couple of considerations here. Just wanted to elaborate on your commentary in the script \u2013 on the script around dividend and just re-observation therein, I know today you guys obviously are but just considerations. And then secondly you have some very interesting wording around cash and/or assets and US utility assets to that. To the extent to which you are not necessarily successful gaining a asset swap or what have you, how do you see this leading potentially to a second stage US utility combination as well. Just one step versus two steps, I'd love to hear your train of (00:26:23) thoughts?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Sure. So, on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, let me \u2013 maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking about that. I kind of put it into four main buckets, right. The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet, better position us moving power, and again I think targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our discussions with the agencies, we think that maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings, where we are currently coming out of this, with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of the company moving forward. So that's the kind of the bucket number one. The second which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets, as we think about the operating model that we deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model, we think we can acquire some US utility assets, whether as part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. Obviously with PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish, since 2011 we've grown our rate base CAGR in NPA (00:27:53) by about 12%, at the same time our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power by about 20%, and of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpin that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments and including the advanced smart grid technology and grid automation, of course looking at better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management systems, so the software side of that as well. And then moving to digital technologies, on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about, and so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated, and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power. So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so, again if we are able to acquire an asset in the US either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value again both for shareholders and customers. Kind of the third bucket...\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Let me...\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: ...given the \u2013 go ahead.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: No, no, no. Go, go.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: The third bucket just given the strengthening of the balance sheet, we could think about renewables a bit differently than we do today, which will have a direct impact on reducing our carbon footprint and enhancing the growth profile quite frankly just given the credit metrics that we have today that hasn't really been a lever that we've been able to pull in any significant way. And then return of capital to shareholders would be kind of that fourth bucket although I would say our strong preference is to redeploy the proceeds into US growth assets, as it comes to return on capital.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: If I can clarify your US utility, (00:30:21) from an acquisition, I mean, could this be a sale and/or a merger of equals, I just want to understand a little bit your philosophy maybe at the end of the day, what's your philosophy in terms of EPS accretion of any deal just to give you guys the opportunity to clarify?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. Look, I don't think it's appropriate to speculate on the buy side M&A at this point since we're just launching the process on the sell side for WPD. And maybe I'll just comment, Julien, take a big step back and make a couple comments that I recognize that announcing the launch of the process today as opposed to making this announcement when we have a deal, we recognize that we're not going to have all the answers to your questions. Right. And a lot of your questions may depend on what the actual transaction is, the proceeds and then the use of those proceeds. But given the amount of questions that we've gotten from investors and from sell side over the years specifically regarding strategic alternatives for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announce the process. It also has benefits in terms of the process itself, it is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting and so we believe the buyer universe will be those that \u2013 or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more akin to what they're accustomed to, we think will help with the process itself. So we think we just maximize the flexibility, we think there'll be a lot of interest and it just improves the probability that we'll be able to execute it. So just wanted to just make a general comment on that, but recognizing that we really don't have specifics on the transaction or the proceeds, or the use of those proceeds. I think it's a bit premature to speculate on the buy side, use of those proceeds, to your question.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Congrats again. Excellent. Look forward to it. Thank you.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah, hey, good morning. So...\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Hi, Steve.\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, Vince. So just I guess in the event that you're able to find a transaction that includes US assets, utility assets from a buyer, could that potentially be like a like kind exchange treatment for that portion, where you could defer tax or not clear?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Not likely that we would get like kind exchange treatment, Steve, but we \u2013 one of the issues we discussed in the past was just tax leakage on a transaction and maybe I'll let Joe talk a little bit about kind of our views on that. So we do think we...\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Yeah. That would be helpful.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: We've identified with ways to minimize that burden, but I don't think like kind exchange would be the way to do it, but go ahead, Joe.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. So, tax has been one of those limiting factors for us previously and as we've said many times this is an area that we would continue to focus on, but as a result of some changes that came about from the TCJA we believe that there are some transaction structures that allow us to offset a significant portion of the tax burden. So those changes along with our NOL balance we believe we're in much better position today than we were previously.\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Oh, that's good. Okay. Okay. So to the degree, assets might be involved it would just be because you like the value of that, it wouldn't have any other real rationale versus cash, I guess? And I guess it's a directory investment too, so limits dilution risk?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. I mean, look we're going to look at various different structures and look at maximizing shareowner return, and whether that's all cash or combination of cash and assets, way too early to tell, but at the end of the day we are \u2013 the goal here is to maximize shareowner value, but it's also to set the company up for long-term growth and value for investors as well. So we'll factor all that in. I think if you look at our track record of M&A, whether it was acquiring Kentucky in 2010 and the Midlands acquisitions in 2011, and then (00:35:12) off the Genco in 2015, right, all of those created significant shareholder value at the time we did them. So, we'll deal with this in a very thoughtful way with the Board and our advisors and ultimately pick the best structure that optimizes long-term growth and value.\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. And then just, on the dividend, could you just be maybe a little more clear on the dividend post this whole transaction, kind of how you're thinking about that, is it just something where you'll assess all the pieces at the time and determine what to do with it or just is there any more color you could just give on that to fill out the picture?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. Look, I just think it's too early Steve to get into any specifics on if there would be an adjustment if any to the dividend. To your point, we'll take a look at all of this at the time we announce the transaction and then the Board will assess the dividend at that time. But as a result of the announcement today, we are not adjusting the dividend at all. And that will continue to remain an important part of our overall TSR, which is \u2013 has always been the case for PPL and will continue. Just think it's too early to get into really any specific scenarios around the dividend.\nSteven I. Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Hey. Good morning, Vince and Joe.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Good morning, Durgesh.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Maybe just Joe can you go back to the tax basis issue, I \u2013 sort of, I remember this sort of being a hurdle to get the deal done. So what exactly, so with TCJA you're actually in a much favorable position and then I heard you say NOLs perhaps were bigger than they were when you evaluated this perhaps maybe 12, 16, 24 months ago, but just can you elaborate any more color on what change with TCJA?\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Yeah, sure. So, first of all, the NOL balance really hasn't changed. It's just I think we would \u2013 with NOL like, we would be utilizing that NOL balance in the transaction, but we'll have to see ultimately what the transaction is. As far as the TCJA changes go, as you can appreciate, as with most things tax related it's complicated, it's also very technical and the reality is, it's transaction specific. So given the flexibility that we're creating and talking about today around the potential transaction, we're not going to get into specifics on any of the details at this time. I would just say though that these, these are very low risk strategies that we found and so we feel comfortable with our ability to utilize them.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Understood.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: But...\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: This is Vince. I would just say that the tax component of it, that Joe talked about, is just one component. I think at the end of the day, when we think about the current market for these types of assets in Europe and even in the UK, we just think that the after-tax proceeds that we would expect today are quite higher than we would have 18 months to 24 months ago when the nationalization risk within the middle of the all the discussion, and (00:38:51) was in the middle of it all. So, I think, that, while the tax component is certainly helping, it's the total net after-tax proceeds that we'd just think is much stronger now than it was.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Understood. But just to be clear, you still expect the tax leakage, you just think from a tax to specifically tax perspective, you're better now versus let's say 24 months ago and you also think the UK assets would fetch you better value here than perhaps 24 months \u2013 16 to 24 months ago?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Correct on both points.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. And then maybe just one last follow up, Vince, the timing first half of 2021 is there \u2013 are you \u2013 did you just officially kick start the process or have you been actively talking to parties? It just seems like you're pretty confident in that first half of 2021 schedule, am I reading too much into it?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Well, the regulatory process in the UK is much shorter than in the US. So getting from announcement to a deal to close could take as little as 30 to 60 days as opposed to what we're accustomed to here in the US. So all we're doing with that kind of first half or 2021 commentary is providing enough time, so we are launching the process today. So we need to do all of the activities that go into actually launching the process and then likely a couple rounds of bids and then a couple of months of allotment for approval time should \u2013 we should be able to get that done, between now and the middle of next year.\nDurgesh Chopra - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. That's great, Vince. And congratulations on your first earnings call as CEO and good luck.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Hey, good morning.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Just to sort of clarify the tax situation. For the most part, it sounds like you plan on offsetting through \u2013 in terms of structuring the transaction and NOLs that there really won't be any significant tax leakage, is that right?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Joe, you want to?\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Yeah, certainly through the transaction structuring of the NOL, we think we can offset a significant portion of merely what the resulting tax will be, I think, we'll just have to wait and see what the transaction is, and what \u2013 given that we're open to a variety of transaction structures, that we'll want to see (00:41:33) where we end up at the end of the day.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then just you're launching the formal process, was there an informal process, have you put any feelers out or anything else to sort of or is this pretty much just you're really just starting the process in general here, where there's no \u2013 you haven't had any preliminary discussions or anything?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: No, just between us and our advisors, no outreach to.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay. And then finally the credit rating for the new entity assuming the transaction happens and everything and how should we think about how you guys want to be if there's any particularly changing credit rating metric or credit rating itself, goals or anything, has that changed?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. Go ahead Joe.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Yeah. No, no changes to those objectives, Paul. We would as Vince mentioned in his remarks, we would expect to target FFO to debt in the mid-teens and certainly lowering our (00:42:34) to total debt percentage as part of that. So, maintaining our current credit ratings and improving the credit metrics is one of the objectives.\nPaul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Just curious can you remind us what's the size of the NOLs currently, I'm just trying to think about the ramifications of an all cash deal?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Sure. It's \u2013 at the end of 2019, it was about $1.5 billion.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. And when you think about it or just the timeline of this, how do you think about from the time you make a deal announcement to the time of an actual close, like what have you seen in the UK in terms of just process-wise from announced deals or closing time?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. So when we announced the acquisition of Midlands, Michael, it was 38 (43:27).\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So you expect a relatively quick close for a buyer, so a potential buyer couldn't have to go 6 to 9 months or so like you often see in the US, if not longer, before being able to close and therefore have a role in the real process?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. I think that depends on who the buyer is, but either way I don't think you're looking at the length of the process that we're seeing in the US.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. And then last on Kentucky, I've asked this \u2013 on this a bit in prior earnings call, how do you look at your Kentucky fleet right now? How much of the coal generating capacity there, what percent roughly, do you think comprise \u2013 it's made up of smaller, less kind of uneconomic unit that lack economy, really lack economy of scale of the coal fleet?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. So I mean, Paul, I think you're on. I don't know if you have specifics on some of the smaller parts of the fleet. I mean, I think for the most part with the 1,200 megawatts that we retired, Michael, those are pretty well out of the fleet. But, Paul, any thoughts on that.\nPaul W. Thompson - PPL Corp.: Right. I would say, Michael, that the fleet that we have today is larger, more economic. By and large, as Vince just indicated, over the last few years we have retired smaller older units and so what we have today on the margin is very efficient and effective, all in compliance, but obviously there is a progression of smaller units existing to larger and as some of the regulations and economics may change, we'll continue to look at retiring those at the appropriate time and with the appropriate approvals, but I guess I would leave you with the thought that today the fossil fleet is a pretty efficient one.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And how about the regulatory politics of retiring existing coal units in what is still somewhat of a coal state like Kentucky and replacing them with either gas or wind?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah. The economics are going to drive that. We \u2013 again we've done 1,200 megawatts over the last five years. And I have no \u2013 I've had no issues dealing with the commission and the state on that. But economics is what drove that. So, as we think about, this is kind of a follow on to Paul's comment as we look at renewables or if there are \u2013 if Biden wins the election and the Senate flips to Democrats, Biden's plan is calling for net carbon neutral from the power sector by 2035 so that would likely require a more aggressive coal retirement strategy than what we're currently working under current regulation and legislation. So, I think a lot of things could factor into that, Michael, but for the most part that the commission has been \u2013 again if there's a regulatory requirement to do it, then we have to do it after that it's economics. So Paul, I don't know if you have any additional thoughts on that.\nPaul W. Thompson - PPL Corp.: No, I would just reiterate what you're saying. We've had a good process on everything that we've done heretofore and so I would expect that to continue as the conditions change for whatever reasons.\nMichael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Paul Freemont with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Thank you very much and congratulations on the announcement. I was hoping you could be a maybe a little bit more specific on the FFO to debt. We have you I think in the 14% to 15% range. Are you looking \u2013 when you say mid-teens, are you looking to maintain that or are you looking for that to go up and if it's going up by roughly \u2013 by how much?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah, Joe, I'll let you take that.\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Yeah, Paul, I think, it's too early to say. I think the point that we want to make today is that we would target FFO to debt metric in the mid-teens and we look to maintain our current credit ratings. Our ratings have been and will continue to be important to us and we've taken the necessary steps to maintaining those ratings, and this transaction would be no different. So I think our current credit ratings, we're happy with where they are and we'd be willing just to maintain them and that may include improving our current metric a bit to do so, but we'll have to see what the transaction looks like at the end before we get into more details.\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: And is that because one of the rating agencies at least looks at the UK business as having lower business risk than the US utilities?\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Both of the agencies view the UK favorably in our credit rating. So selling the UK, how they view the standalone business, I think we have to have discussions with them about that and of course what assets could potentially come along with the transaction would be another factor there. So I just \u2013 I think at this point it's really too early to get into details around the specific credit metric other than to say that we want to maintain our current credit ratings.\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: And then can you provide what would you consider to be sort of comps, you mentioned sort of generically what's \u2013 what some of the recent comps look like, but can you \u2013 what transactions would you consider to be similar to yours?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Well, like I said you have the gas distribution networks that National Grid sold a couple years ago, E&W sold within the last couple years. There's been some other electric distribution networks that have sold in other parts of Europe, actually more recently than that. So those are kind of the assets that we're talking about, the businesses, the comps that we're talking about.\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: And then last question from me, I guess, what would you consider to be an appropriate payout on sort of a US regulated electric?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Sorry, are you referring to a dividend payout?\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Yes.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: I mean, I think, where you see sector right is kind of a net 60% to 70% range. Somewhere 65% to 70%, somewhere 60% to 65%. But kind of in that, in the 60s range is kind of right average for our sector.\nPaul Fremont - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. To the extent you're looking to return capital to shareholders as a result of this transaction, can you comment on preliminary thoughts around efficient ways to return capital to shareholders, buyback or special dividends given where the assets are held?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Yeah, Joe, do you want to take that?\nJoseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Ryan. I think, again, it's too early to say how that would play out, although I think today I'd say the preference would be on buybacks rather than a special dividend, but we'll have to again see what it looks like when we get there.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. And then what's the regulatory process differences that there would be if the UK business was transacted in pieces versus the whole, and is there anything that would prevent PPL from keeping a smaller part of the UK business longer-term?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: I mean, I would just say that our intention in launching the process is a full exit of the business, so I don't know that there is anything that would preclude us from owning a part of WPD going forward other than our intention. We think the \u2013 again, we think the interest level in this business will be high, the market is hot right now for infrastructure assets, so we think these assets will be in demand and we do recognize this will be a large equity check given the size of the WPD business, but that's where potentially including US assets as consideration improves the probability of getting it done because it reduces the amount of cash that's required. So, again, we think just maximum flexibility in kicking this process off just improves the probability of getting to the end result that we're shooting for, which is a full exit of the business.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Appreciate that. And just wanted to follow-up to the extent that your intent to sell the entire business, are there any tax advantages if you were to sell part as opposed to the whole, given the NOLs and your legacy assets?\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.: Not really. I mean there could be tax advantage or cash tax advantage if you don't sell the whole thing, but from a taxable perspective, it's whether you sell one or four, just pro rata.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn over to management for any closing remarks.\nVincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.:  Great. Thanks. I just want to close out the call thanking everybody for your time in joining us today. I just want to reiterate that today's announcement was part of a broader strategic repositioning for the company following strategic review that we conducted with the Board and again reinforcing that we believe this will create shareholder value not only in the near-term for our shareowners, but set the company up for the long-term as well with stronger balance sheet, better earnings growth, and more opportunity to deploy capital, whether that's in the clean energy sector or within our utilities, so really looking forward to getting going on this process and providing more details if and when appropriate. I'm just really excited about the future of the company, so appreciate everybody's time and thank you. Operator, we can close out the call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vincent Sorgi - PPL Corp.",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be leading my first earnings call as CEO, as we certainly have a lot to talk about this morning. With me today are Joe Bergstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Greg Dudkin, the Head of our Pennsylvania Utility business; Paul Thompson, the Head of our Kentucky Utility business; and Phil Swift, who leads WPD, our electric distribution business in the UK. Moving to slide 3, I'll begin this morning's call with comments on today's announcement to initiate a process to sell our operations in the UK. Then I'll discuss some quarterly highlights and operational updates including our continued strong performance during COVID-19 pandemic, and some thoughts around Ofgem's latest publications on the RIIO-2 process. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of the second quarter financial update, and as always we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. So turning to slide 4, today we announced after completing a comprehensive strategic review with our Board of Directors that we are going to initiate a process to sell our UK business, WPD. We've engaged JPMorgan to lead that process for us. The sale which strategically repositions PPL as a purely US utility holding company, sharpening our focus on rate regulated assets in the US, and improving our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. We expect the proceeds from the sale would be used to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our long-term earnings growth which could include supporting US asset acquisitions and returning capital to share owners. We believe there are multiple ways in which this transaction will create shareowner value. First, we strongly believe the sale price net of any cash will be higher than the sum of the parts value currently embedded in PPL stock price. Second, we believe we will have a much stronger balance sheet post-sale, targeting mid-teens FFO to debt metric. Third, we believe we can target an EPS growth rate more in line with our US utility peers. And finally, assuming we acquire another US utility we believe we can leverage our operational excellence and efficient business model to create even more value for both customers and shareowners. We've been very transparent with investors that while we constantly analyze strategic alternatives, we would not engage in M&A unless we could do it in a way that would create shareholder value. We firmly believe that the sale of WPD at this time will unlock value for our shareowners. As we've been saying for a number of years, we believe WPD represents the premier asset group with an extremely high performing management team in the best energy subsector in the UK, i.e. electric distribution. We are more confident than ever that the road to net-zero carbon emissions in the UK will flow through electric distribution. And significant investment will be required in that sector if the UK is going to achieve its net-zero goals, which Ofgem reaffirmed over a week ago in the electric distribution subsector consultation. I expect that WPD will have the opportunity to earn reasonable returns and invest significant amounts of capital during RIIO-ED2 and well beyond that. As such, the decision to sell WPD is in no way a negative reflection on our WPD team or the WPD business, in fact it's quite the opposite. We are extremely proud of the financial and operational results that WPD has achieved over the past two decades and we are confident they will continue to deliver in the future. And while we believe the public market continues to discount the value of WPD in our share price, we firmly expect that a wide range of strategic and financial buyers will demonstrate significant interest in this highly attractive asset. There are several recent precedent transactions of regulated networks in the UK and across broader Europe that support our position. Given the relative attractiveness of electric distribution and the superior quality of the WPD business, we would expect WPD to attract a premium valuation. We expect to evaluate a variety of offers for the purchase of WPD, including all cash or a combination of cash and US utility assets. Regarding timing, we would intend to announce a transaction within the first half of next year. Let me just end by saying the plan to sell WPD is part of a broader strategic repositioning of the company, which we believe will result in a new PPL with a stronger balance sheet, a more focused growth strategy in the US, and an improved position to reduce its carbon footprint. We believe this will lead to a stronger outlook for the company, with a competitive TSR and compelling growth prospects. The dividend has been and will remain an important part of total shareowner return for PPL investors. There's no change in the dividend as a result of the announcement this morning. The Board will assess the dividend at the appropriate time in connection with the resulting transaction. Now, let me make some high level comments on the quarterly results before turning it over to Joe for the more detailed quarterly review. Turning to slide 5, today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.45 per share; adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.55 per share compared with $0.58 per share a year ago. Turning to a brief update on the impacts of COVID-19, I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably, as our customers navigate the challenges of this pandemic. As we highlighted on our first quarter call, we acted swiftly and aggressively to implement social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus within our company. This included shifting about 35% to 40% of our workforce, or more than 4,500 employees to work from home and creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their jobs. With health and safety our top priority, these steps remain in place today even as restrictions have begun to ease in the regions in which we operate. And while we continue to plan for what re-entry to the workplace will look like for those now at home we plan to move very cautiously and continue to follow guidance from the CDC and state and local health departments. As a result of the measures we've taken, we've been very effective in minimizing the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and our operations. While the most recent Tropical Storm Isaias impacted about 70,000 of our customers in Pennsylvania, we were able to restore power to most of them within 24 hours and all of them within 48 hours, reinforcing again little to no impact from COVID-19 on our ability to serve our customers even in the worst of conditions. Further, we remain well-positioned from a supply chain perspective and our capital plans remain on track as we've experienced minimal delay, apart from the early lockdown phase in the UK. Finally from a financial perspective we've maintained a strong liquidity position of over $4 billion, our cash receipts have remained steady and minimal impact on our allowance for bad debt. Turning to a UK regulatory update, we've seen some recent developments pertaining to the next price control period RIIO-2. First, we were not surprised at all by the recent outcomes of the draft determinations for gas and transmission published in early July. Ofgem has been very clear about three things in there RIIO-2 messaging. They are going to incentivize investment that supports the UK's net zero carbon ambitions, they will ensure customer bills remain affordable, and there will be significant investment required in electric distribution over at least the next decade. We've said all along that Ofgem was going to deemphasize the gas and transmission sectors in favor of electric distribution. Not because they are picking winners and losers, but because they fundamentally know the electric distribution networks will require significant investment going forward. In order for customers to afford that level of investment, they need to build headroom into customer bills with lower returns and lower investment levels in gas and transmission. We believe that is why Ofgem has been so critical of the investment plans of both the gas and transmission subsectors. On average, Ofgem cut the gas investment plans by about 20% and cut the transmission plans by about 45%. While Ofgem indicated there would be potential opportunities for some of that investment to be accrued in the final determinations, which will come out later this year, I don't believe Ofgem is going to make it easy on these sectors. WPD is in the fortunate position however to be able to follow the gas and transmission process through to the end, prior to us having to submit our business plans mid-next year. Therefore, we are expecting that the RIIO-ED2 process for WPD will be much smoother and more successful. The sector specific methodology consultation on electric distribution that was released just over a week ago was also largely in line with our expectations. Ofgem made it clear that the DNOs were going to be critical, to supporting the de-carbonization efforts in the UK, to deliver a net zero economy. And we continue to agree that we're best positioned to deliver on those objectives. While we are still in the early stages of this process, WPD is very focused and engaged with our stakeholders and Ofgem to ensure we deliver a plan that will achieve these goals. We've led the way in RIIO-1 in terms of stakeholder engagement and will continue to lead in this area as we begin our business planning process towards the end of this year. While many other parameters are still being developed, let me talk a little bit about our expectations for the electric distribution incentive package. Based on our recent discussions with Ofgem, we expect the incentive scheme for ED2 to continue to play a significant role in the overall returns for the electric distribution sector, much more significant compared to gas and transmission. In addition to the reliability and customer incentives we're accustomed to, I would expect to see significant output measures for low carbon initiatives, promoting flexibility of the network and other net zero related outputs. So while incentives are not a significant component of the gas and transmission subsector reviews, we absolutely continue to expect it to be meaningful for ED2. And finally, regarding our 2020 earnings forecast, while COVID-19 has had an impact on our year-to-date financial results and we expect it to negatively impact the remainder of the year as well, we continue to believe the full year impact will be manageable. Therefore we reiterated our earnings guidance range for 2020 of $2.40 to $2.60 per share with results expected to track towards the lower end of our forecast range given COVID and unfavorable weather in the first half of the year. In a positive sign we began to see a gradual easing of restrictions later in the quarter that dampened some of the impact we were seeing in April from strict lockdown measures. Residential load continues to be stronger than planned as a result of the continued work from home measures, and while C&I is still below plan in all three business units it is not as bad as we were originally expecting it to be. Regarding 2021 we are withdrawing our prior 2021 forecast as a result of today's announcement regarding the potential sale of the UK business, and we will provide an updated 2021 forecast at the conclusion of the process which we expect to occur in the first half of 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a more detailed financial update. Joe? Thanks, Joe. Let me conclude today's remarks with an outline of some of my key areas of focus for the company and my excitement for PPL's bright future. As I've mentioned to many of you over the past few months, I'm extremely proud of our operational excellence at PPL which is core to our mission of delivering safe and reliable service at an affordable price. This has been and will continue to be a priority for the company as it has led to continuous innovation and operational improvements that are driving our premier customer service and satisfaction levels. One of my goals is to take this culture of operational excellence and find ways to leverage it to drive additional value for our customers and shareowners. Another one of my goals is to improve our overall TSR performance and the strategic repositioning announced this morning is one step in that direction. I'm sure our decision to launch the sale process for WPD doesn't come as a surprise to investors given PPL stock performance over the past few years. We believe today's announcement creates the best path forward to improve our TSR by simplifying the business mix, reducing our leverage, improving our earnings growth rate, and enhancing our ability to invest in sustainable energy solutions. Another key area of focus will be to reduce the carbon footprint of the company. We've already communicated our targets of reducing CO2 emissions by at least 70% by 2040 and at least 80% by 2050. With the declining costs of renewable energy, we believe there will be a real opportunity to accelerate the carbonization of our Kentucky fleet under regulatory oversight and with economic benefit for our customers. In closing, I'm very excited for the future of PPL. I firmly believe that the company's organic growth opportunities and strengthened financial flexibility expected from today's announced strategic repositioning best position PPL to deliver long-term value to both our shareowners and our customers. We look forward to providing further updates at the conclusion of the process or as appropriate. With that operator, let's open the call for questions. Good morning. Sure. So, I think, there's been quite a bit of change actually, right, we've been very transparent with the market and our investors that while we constantly review strategic options to maximize value that we would not engage in M&A unless we thought, right, that it would create value for our shareowners. And as I said in my prepared remarks, at this point, we believe that the market has shifted and that executing the sale of WPD will in fact create not only immediate value for shareowners, but will set the company up going forward for longer term growth with a stronger balance sheet. In terms of the market backdrop right last year, we had the general election in the UK, (00:22:48) election they failed, renationalization risk is in the rearview mirror. We believe there's been additional clarity around the RIIO2 process primarily for electric distribution which supports what we've been saying from the beginning in terms of supporting electric distribution and the road to zero kind of flowing through that subsector, so we've got some clarity on all that. Unfortunately that additional clarity really has not improved our stock price performance, certainly not to the level you would have expected and in fact the discount has widened compared to our peers. So again, the market also on the buy side for these types of assets is pretty strong right now in Europe. There has been a number of comps that we saw starting with gas distribution in the UK, electric distribution in the UK and then some other electric assets in broader Europe that have yielded some very strong results. So we think given the quality of the UK business and the management team and again the subsector that we're dealing with, we firmly believe that the process will be successful and will garner a greater value for WPD and a sale process then will be recognized in the share price. Yeah. I don't want to get into necessarily specifics on who the names that might be interested or the structures. I think, what we've done today with the announcement has created maximum flexibility around that. So I think you're going to see some creativity on the part of buyers, whether it's cash, a combination of cash and perhaps assets in the US that certainly we will entertain as those they start coming in and we work with JPMorgan on all of that stuff. So at this point, I don't know that that market power would be a top concern, but certainly we'll deal with that if appropriate. No, that's \u2013 we pretty much stopped working actively on Compass. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Sure. So, on the generic use of proceeds, Julien, let me \u2013 maybe let me just talk about how we're kind of thinking about that. I kind of put it into four main buckets, right. The first will be to strengthen the balance sheet, better position us moving power, and again I think targeting a mid-teens FFO to debt based on our discussions with the agencies, we think that maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings, where we are currently coming out of this, with a lot more flexibility and levers to pull as we think about future growth of the company moving forward. So that's the kind of the bucket number one. The second which is kind of to your point, looking at future long-term earnings growth with investments in regulated utility assets, as we think about the operating model that we deployed at PPL and the efficiency of that model, we think we can acquire some US utility assets, whether as part of the consideration coming from the deal or to your point a potential follow-on and create significant shareholder and customer value. Obviously with PPL Electric Utilities here in Pennsylvania as an example of what we've been able to accomplish, since 2011 we've grown our rate base CAGR in NPA (00:27:53) by about 12%, at the same time our O&M has grown less than 1%. And our average PPL Electric utility rate is about 25% less than the average in the Mid-Atlantic region. We've improved our customer satisfaction scores from J.D. Power by about 20%, and of course, improved reliability at the same time by about 30%. So the kind of the strategy that underpin that was a clear focus on hardening our system as we were making these investments and including the advanced smart grid technology and grid automation, of course looking at better integration of distributed energy resources, including distributed energy resource management systems, so the software side of that as well. And then moving to digital technologies, on the IT front has done a lot to actually reduce the O&M and drive that less than 1% CAGR that I talked about, and so all of that kind of results in our ability to become more efficient, deploy that capital into the network and bring the network into a state that's more flexible, more automated, and more friendly to distributed energy resources and green sources of power. So we think at this point that we've gotten that model that to a point where we could replicate that. And so, again if we are able to acquire an asset in the US either through the consideration or a follow-on, we think that would be another opportunity to create long-term value again both for shareholders and customers. Kind of the third bucket... ...given the \u2013 go ahead. The third bucket just given the strengthening of the balance sheet, we could think about renewables a bit differently than we do today, which will have a direct impact on reducing our carbon footprint and enhancing the growth profile quite frankly just given the credit metrics that we have today that hasn't really been a lever that we've been able to pull in any significant way. And then return of capital to shareholders would be kind of that fourth bucket although I would say our strong preference is to redeploy the proceeds into US growth assets, as it comes to return on capital. Yeah. Look, I don't think it's appropriate to speculate on the buy side M&A at this point since we're just launching the process on the sell side for WPD. And maybe I'll just comment, Julien, take a big step back and make a couple comments that I recognize that announcing the launch of the process today as opposed to making this announcement when we have a deal, we recognize that we're not going to have all the answers to your questions. Right. And a lot of your questions may depend on what the actual transaction is, the proceeds and then the use of those proceeds. But given the amount of questions that we've gotten from investors and from sell side over the years specifically regarding strategic alternatives for WPD. We just wanted to be transparent with the market and announce the process. It also has benefits in terms of the process itself, it is common in Europe to announce these types of sale processes at the time you launch it as opposed to waiting and so we believe the buyer universe will be those that \u2013 or will include those that have played in that European market. So having a process that's more akin to what they're accustomed to, we think will help with the process itself. So we think we just maximize the flexibility, we think there'll be a lot of interest and it just improves the probability that we'll be able to execute it. So just wanted to just make a general comment on that, but recognizing that we really don't have specifics on the transaction or the proceeds, or the use of those proceeds. I think it's a bit premature to speculate on the buy side, use of those proceeds, to your question. Thanks, Julien. Hi, Steve. Not likely that we would get like kind exchange treatment, Steve, but we \u2013 one of the issues we discussed in the past was just tax leakage on a transaction and maybe I'll let Joe talk a little bit about kind of our views on that. So we do think we... We've identified with ways to minimize that burden, but I don't think like kind exchange would be the way to do it, but go ahead, Joe. Yeah. I mean, look we're going to look at various different structures and look at maximizing shareowner return, and whether that's all cash or combination of cash and assets, way too early to tell, but at the end of the day we are \u2013 the goal here is to maximize shareowner value, but it's also to set the company up for long-term growth and value for investors as well. So we'll factor all that in. I think if you look at our track record of M&A, whether it was acquiring Kentucky in 2010 and the Midlands acquisitions in 2011, and then (00:35:12) off the Genco in 2015, right, all of those created significant shareholder value at the time we did them. So, we'll deal with this in a very thoughtful way with the Board and our advisors and ultimately pick the best structure that optimizes long-term growth and value. Yeah. Look, I just think it's too early Steve to get into any specifics on if there would be an adjustment if any to the dividend. To your point, we'll take a look at all of this at the time we announce the transaction and then the Board will assess the dividend at that time. But as a result of the announcement today, we are not adjusting the dividend at all. And that will continue to remain an important part of our overall TSR, which is \u2013 has always been the case for PPL and will continue. Just think it's too early to get into really any specific scenarios around the dividend. Thank you. Good morning, Durgesh. Yeah, Durgesh. This is Vince. I would just say that the tax component of it, that Joe talked about, is just one component. I think at the end of the day, when we think about the current market for these types of assets in Europe and even in the UK, we just think that the after-tax proceeds that we would expect today are quite higher than we would have 18 months to 24 months ago when the nationalization risk within the middle of the all the discussion, and (00:38:51) was in the middle of it all. So, I think, that, while the tax component is certainly helping, it's the total net after-tax proceeds that we'd just think is much stronger now than it was. Correct on both points. Well, the regulatory process in the UK is much shorter than in the US. So getting from announcement to a deal to close could take as little as 30 to 60 days as opposed to what we're accustomed to here in the US. So all we're doing with that kind of first half or 2021 commentary is providing enough time, so we are launching the process today. So we need to do all of the activities that go into actually launching the process and then likely a couple rounds of bids and then a couple of months of allotment for approval time should \u2013 we should be able to get that done, between now and the middle of next year. Thank you so much. Good morning, Paul. Joe, you want to? No, just between us and our advisors, no outreach to. Yeah. Go ahead Joe. Sure. It's \u2013 at the end of 2019, it was about $1.5 billion. Yeah. So when we announced the acquisition of Midlands, Michael, it was 38 (43:27). Yeah. I think that depends on who the buyer is, but either way I don't think you're looking at the length of the process that we're seeing in the US. Yeah. So I mean, Paul, I think you're on. I don't know if you have specifics on some of the smaller parts of the fleet. I mean, I think for the most part with the 1,200 megawatts that we retired, Michael, those are pretty well out of the fleet. But, Paul, any thoughts on that. Yeah. The economics are going to drive that. We \u2013 again we've done 1,200 megawatts over the last five years. And I have no \u2013 I've had no issues dealing with the commission and the state on that. But economics is what drove that. So, as we think about, this is kind of a follow on to Paul's comment as we look at renewables or if there are \u2013 if Biden wins the election and the Senate flips to Democrats, Biden's plan is calling for net carbon neutral from the power sector by 2035 so that would likely require a more aggressive coal retirement strategy than what we're currently working under current regulation and legislation. So, I think a lot of things could factor into that, Michael, but for the most part that the commission has been \u2013 again if there's a regulatory requirement to do it, then we have to do it after that it's economics. So Paul, I don't know if you have any additional thoughts on that. Thanks, Michael. Yeah, Joe, I'll let you take that. Well, like I said you have the gas distribution networks that National Grid sold a couple years ago, E&W sold within the last couple years. There's been some other electric distribution networks that have sold in other parts of Europe, actually more recently than that. So those are kind of the assets that we're talking about, the businesses, the comps that we're talking about. Sorry, are you referring to a dividend payout? I mean, I think, where you see sector right is kind of a net 60% to 70% range. Somewhere 65% to 70%, somewhere 60% to 65%. But kind of in that, in the 60s range is kind of right average for our sector. Thank you. Yeah, Joe, do you want to take that? I mean, I would just say that our intention in launching the process is a full exit of the business, so I don't know that there is anything that would preclude us from owning a part of WPD going forward other than our intention. We think the \u2013 again, we think the interest level in this business will be high, the market is hot right now for infrastructure assets, so we think these assets will be in demand and we do recognize this will be a large equity check given the size of the WPD business, but that's where potentially including US assets as consideration improves the probability of getting it done because it reduces the amount of cash that's required. So, again, we think just maximum flexibility in kicking this process off just improves the probability of getting to the end result that we're shooting for, which is a full exit of the business.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Appreciate that. And just wanted to follow-up to the extent that your intent to sell the entire business, are there any tax advantages if you were to sell part as opposed to the whole, given the NOLs and your legacy assets? Not really. I mean there could be tax advantage or cash tax advantage if you don't sell the whole thing, but from a taxable perspective, it's whether you sell one or four, just pro rata.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. Great. Thanks. I just want to close out the call thanking everybody for your time in joining us today. I just want to reiterate that today's announcement was part of a broader strategic repositioning for the company following strategic review that we conducted with the Board and again reinforcing that we believe this will create shareholder value not only in the near-term for our shareowners, but set the company up for the long-term as well with stronger balance sheet, better earnings growth, and more opportunity to deploy capital, whether that's in the clean energy sector or within our utilities, so really looking forward to getting going on this process and providing more details if and when appropriate. I'm just really excited about the future of the company, so appreciate everybody's time and thank you. Operator, we can close out the call."

By and large, as Vince just indicated, over the last few years we have retired smaller older units and so what we have today on the margin is very efficient and effective, all in compliance, but obviously there is a progression of smaller units existing to larger and as some of the regulations and economics may change, we'll continue to look at retiring those at the appropriate time and with the appropriate approvals, but I guess I would leave you with the thought that today the fossil fleet is a pretty efficient one. No, I would just reiterate what you're saying. We've had a good process on everything that we've done heretofore and so I would expect that to continue as the conditions change for whatever reasons."

            "name": "Joseph P. Bergstein, Jr. - PPL Corp.",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our second quarter segment results on slide 6. First, I'd like to highlight that the estimated impact from COVID on our second quarter results was about $0.06 per share, which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the UK and lower demand revenue in Kentucky. As we outlined in our projections on the first quarter call, about two-thirds of the impact or $0.04 per share is recoverable through the UK decoupling mechanism on a two-year lag. I'll discuss further the impacts of COVID on the quarterly sales volumes in more detail in a few moments. Turning to the quarterly walk and starting with Q2 2019 ongoing results on the left. We first reflect adjustments for weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. During the second quarter, we experienced a $0.01 favorable variance due to weather compared to the second quarter of 2019 primarily in Pennsylvania. Compared to our forecast, weather in the second quarter was about a $0.01 unfavorable variance with stronger load in Pennsylvania being offset by more mild weather in the UK and Kentucky versus normal conditions. In terms of dilution, we saw a $0.03 impact in the quarter primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. Moving to the segment drivers. Excluding these items, our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.33 per share in the second quarter 2020. This represents a $0.01 decrease compared to a year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower sales volumes primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 and lower other income due to lower pension income. These decreases were partially offset by higher realized foreign currency exchange rates compared to the prior period of Q2 2020 average rates of $1.63 per pound compared to $1.36 per pound in Q2 2019. I'll note that we layered on additional hedges since our last quarterly call and are now hedged at 95% for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.47 per pound. And in light of today's announcement, we did not plan to add additional earnings hedges to 2021. Moving to Pennsylvania, we earned $0.15 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results in Q2 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission. This increase was partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense. I'll note that our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from COVID-19, as our positive impact from our significant residential base in Pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the C&I sectors. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, we earned $0.10 per share, a $0.03 decrease from our results one year ago. The decline was primarily due to lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of COVID-19 and higher income taxes due to a tax credit recognized in the second quarter of 2019. These decreases were partially offset by higher retail rates that were effective May 1, 2019. Results at corporate and other were $0.01 higher compared with a year ago driven by several factors, none of which were individually significant. Turning to slide 7 we outlined the changes in weather normalized sales for each segment by customer class. As expected and reflected in the financial results we saw lower demand in the C&I sectors partially offset by higher demand in the residential space in each of our service territories. In addition, as Vince pointed out, the reopenings that we observed primarily in June substantially reduced the impact on load. For example in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, we went from 15% to 20% C&I load declines at the peak of the lockdowns in April from more modest declines of 8% and 2% respectively for the month of June. In the UK, we saw some positive momentum as the UK government downgraded its alert level mid-month, although the recovery was more modest with June demand down about 11% versus the prior year. I'll note for this slide, the quarterly information presented for the UK aligns with our financial statement presentation on a one month's lag and shows the period-over-period variances from March, April and May. Looking forward, we're encouraged by the recovery we've seen in June, which gives us more comfort in reaffirming the 2020 forecast today albeit at the lower end of the range. We expect the annualized load sensitivities by segment that we provided last quarter will remain as good guides as we move through the balance of the year. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Let me... No, no, no. Go, go. Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Steve. So, tax has been one of those limiting factors for us previously and as we've said many times this is an area that we would continue to focus on, but as a result of some changes that came about from the TCJA we believe that there are some transaction structures that allow us to offset a significant portion of the tax burden. So those changes along with our NOL balance we believe we're in much better position today than we were previously. Good morning. Yeah, sure. So, first of all, the NOL balance really hasn't changed. It's just I think we would \u2013 with NOL like, we would be utilizing that NOL balance in the transaction, but we'll have to see ultimately what the transaction is. As far as the TCJA changes go, as you can appreciate, as with most things tax related it's complicated, it's also very technical and the reality is, it's transaction specific. So given the flexibility that we're creating and talking about today around the potential transaction, we're not going to get into specifics on any of the details at this time. I would just say though that these, these are very low risk strategies that we found and so we feel comfortable with our ability to utilize them. Yeah, certainly through the transaction structuring of the NOL, we think we can offset a significant portion of merely what the resulting tax will be, I think, we'll just have to wait and see what the transaction is, and what \u2013 given that we're open to a variety of transaction structures, that we'll want to see (00:41:33) where we end up at the end of the day. Yeah. No, no changes to those objectives, Paul. We would as Vince mentioned in his remarks, we would expect to target FFO to debt in the mid-teens and certainly lowering our (00:42:34) to total debt percentage as part of that. So, maintaining our current credit ratings and improving the credit metrics is one of the objectives. Sure. Yeah, Paul, I think, it's too early to say. I think the point that we want to make today is that we would target FFO to debt metric in the mid-teens and we look to maintain our current credit ratings. Our ratings have been and will continue to be important to us and we've taken the necessary steps to maintaining those ratings, and this transaction would be no different. So I think our current credit ratings, we're happy with where they are and we'd be willing just to maintain them and that may include improving our current metric a bit to do so, but we'll have to see what the transaction looks like at the end before we get into more details. Both of the agencies view the UK favorably in our credit rating. So selling the UK, how they view the standalone business, I think we have to have discussions with them about that and of course what assets could potentially come along with the transaction would be another factor there. So I just \u2013 I think at this point it's really too early to get into details around the specific credit metric other than to say that we want to maintain our current credit ratings. Yeah. Sure, Ryan. I think, again, it's too early to say how that would play out, although I think today I'd say the preference would be on buybacks rather than a special dividend, but we'll have to again see what it looks like when we get there.\nRyan Levine - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks. And then what's the regulatory process differences that there would be if the UK business was transacted in pieces versus the whole, and is there anything that would prevent PPL from keeping a smaller part of the UK business longer-term?"

Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statement. We will also refer to earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings, a non-GAAP measure on this call. For reconciliations to the GAAP measure, you should refer to the appendix of this presentation and our earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Bill Spence, PPL Chairman and CEO.\nBill Spence: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to slide 3, I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. Turning to slide 4, I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and gas flowing to our over 10 million customers, despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work-from-home. That represents more than 4,500 employees, and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we've worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employee whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most especially the health care facilities that are literally on the frontline fighting this pandemic. As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well-positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position, demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk, which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky along with our U.K. business have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and worked to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assisted programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. Now turning to slide 5, today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment. Turning to the full year, w have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lockdown for the past six weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdiction. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continue in employ work-from-home protocols which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivities that allow shareowners and analysts to assess the potential impact as time goes on. As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly and we see more favorable weather coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal if any impact to our capital and rate-based growth plans and we maintain an attractive dividend and a strong investment-grade rate credit rating. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on slide seven. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices through the April 1, 2019 price increases. I'll note foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven to -- by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago driven by several factors none of which were individually significant. Turning to slide eight. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID and we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in two years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges, in our tariffs that helped to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. Regarding bad debts, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD bills about 150 suppliers with the largest seven suppliers comprising approximately two-thirds of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level, we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID-19. In regard to our capital plan in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance, branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx planned for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the project to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected tot-ex or total expenditures grows towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAV or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territory. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about two-thirds of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins, being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances despite any current year impact to earnings. Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion, of total available liquidity, as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12-and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes, at PPL Capital Funding, providing incremental liquidity and pre-funding the LKE maturity, we have in November of this year. We believe these positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective, for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities, at the operating companies in November. We believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call to Vince, for a brief operational update. Vince?\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on, how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way, we're operating the business. But as a company we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, I'm pleased to report, that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying, how vital our service is to our customers particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time. And to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. Turning to slide 12, I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public, in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers, as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work at home and social distancing measures, that Bill discussed earlier, are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures including temperature, testing we're using masks and gloves and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations and with the work-from-home numbers that we have, we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times. And that starts with not cutting service to customers, and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end-customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end-consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all three of our jurisdictions. And we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain. And we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively, even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time, to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place, both on PPL premises and off. As Joe indicated we've already dialled back our U.K. capital spends to essential only work. But we are continuing to execute the original capital spends in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light, with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S. and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. Turning to slide 13, I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important for the safety of our employees to take a more conservative approach to work. And we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work, to be completed in future periods. Of course we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan. And as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. Looking forward we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan. And we continue to see future investment opportunity, across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next five years, focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer-term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. And finally, moving to slide 14 while we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected, during these difficult times I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL in many utilities that includes the transition to cleaner energy and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction targets announced earlier this year increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in CO2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040. I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill?\nBill Spence: Thanks, Vince. I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future. Our strong financial profile consisting of a significant liquidity position and low-risk capital plan will enable us to manage through an extended economic downturn. Our commitment to exceptional operational performance and customer satisfaction shines bright as we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas during this period of uncertainty. We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to share owner. In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community. As we look to the future, I'm confident that the company will be in good hands led by Vince guided by an outstanding management team supported by more than 12,000 strong in the U.S. and U.K. and poised to deliver for our share owners moving forward. Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years overcoming many difficult challenges in that time. Through World War II, the Great Depression, hurricanes, snowstorms and more generations of PPL employees have answered the call with grid determination and creativity. I have no doubt we will continue to do the same once again in the face of this new and unprecedented challenge. With that, operator let's open the call for questions please.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats both to Bill and Vince. One easy question for you, how does what is happening with demand impact your thoughts on rate case timing in the U.S. and also the kind of the trade-off of filing given a little bit lag and a little bit weaker demand versus the counterbalancing issue of \u2013 with interest rates this low the impact on authorized ROEs and just the regulatory politics of asking for rate increases just given what's going on in the world?\nBill Spence: Sure. Good question, Michael. And thanks for the comments early on there. Vince, do you want to handle that one, but I think you've set up the question well Michael in terms of some of those trade-offs. But Vince you can probably comment.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. And thanks Michael. I appreciate the congrats. So when we think about the U.S. right so Kentucky given the continued high level of investment that we're deploying not only in 2020, but also 2021 we would expect a need to file a rate case in Kentucky within the next year or so. To your point given just the current backdrop with COVID we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid next year. But we are currently assessing that timing given COVID and just the backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guide period through at least 2021. I don't think COVID in and of itself would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say COVID is going to drive us to alter our current plan there in PA.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then in the U.K., can you kind of talk to us about -- are there any changes to the time line regarding kind of the RIIO-2 process both for the T&D transmission in the gas utilities because they're ahead of you in the process and then for obviously the DISCO.\nBill Spence: Sure. Really...\nVince Sorgi: Bill, you want me to take that one?\nBill Spence: I'll start and then if you want to supplement hence that would be fine. Really, we don't expect Michael any impact -- any material impact on the RIIO-ED2 schedule at this point. Our understanding and we've been in constant contact mostly because of COVID-19 operational issues, but in constant contact with Ofgem. And they -- in our last conversation with them indicated that as it relates to the gas and transmission proceedings they are continuing on and they still expect to issue a decision in the summer. As it relates to the electric distribution, as you know there is still a lot of work that's scheduled for 2021 and 2022. This year's were -- at least as it relates to the electric distribution segment is still going forward obviously virtually versus face to face, but we don't really expect this to have any material impact on the timing. Of course, if the COVID-19 pandemic were to go out in time for a much more extended time frame that could change. But right now, it looks like we're still on track. Vince, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add there.\nVince Sorgi: Maybe just a couple of points. So to your point, Ofgem has indicated that they will issue the draft determinations for gas distribution and transmission at the end of July. So they are working hard to keep that timing. Also, in that Q2, Q3 time frame of this year, Ofgem was scheduled to get the ED2 sector methodology consultation out with the final methodology decision in Q4 of this year. That would feed our initial business plan submission in Q2 of next year. We are continuing to work towards that business plan submission for the middle of next year assuming that Ofgem will be on schedule with both the sector methodology consultation and then the final decision. I could see those slipping a little bit, but I think they would probably just contract the time. The overall time leading up to Q2 next year for the business plan submission. So, again, we're preparing to make sure that we can make that submission.\nMichael Lapides: And any upside to CapEx and rate base in the U.K. that's more a RIIO-2 not something that would happen on the next couple of years while you're still under RIIO-1?\nBill Spence: Yes that's correct Michael.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning everyone. Hope you all are doing well and Bill, Vince congratulations. It's been a pleasure. And Vince, I look forward to continuing to work with you here. Wish you the best in your new role.\nBill Spence: Thanks Julien.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. So perhaps, if I could pick it up a little bit where you guys left it off on the last question here. And this might admittedly be a back headed way to ask about the uplift coming in '22 and '23 out of the U.K. What are you reflecting in your updated expectations for the full year rather than just April in terms of low degradation? And again, I also want to just double check about this. Do you talk about two-thirds of that impact in April being allocated to the U.K.? Out of that full year number, how much of it is coming from the U.K. as well? Just to think about like what that uplift eventually is for '22, '23 if that's my goal here.\nBill Spence: Yes sure. So, fortunately we are going to recover all the volume impacts as we see it from 2020 COVID-19. Volumes will be recoverable plus inflation in '22 and '23 as you noted. So, even if we ultimately would have to alter the 2020 forecast due to lower sales in the U.K., economically we'd be no worse off for our investors. So very fortunate to have that mechanism and it is two-thirds of the impact so it is notable in terms of its impact. Joe do you want to comment specifically on our expectation regarding a full year impact what that could be based on the sensitivities we provided?\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. So, we're not projecting the full year impact at this time. As we have the estimate for April and as I've mentioned in prepared remarks, we don't have all of the data yet just as the normal lag in getting that information from suppliers. So it will be a little bit longer here till we get the actual results. We are starting to -- or the U.K. government is starting to talk about reopening businesses and C&I customers in the U.K. So we could see that number -- that impact number change as we move through the year. Regardless we would expect the same level of recoverability for any -- or the same ability to recover any shortfall later in the year. So trying to assess the full year impact at this time is a little difficult given the uncertainty as when -- as to when the U.K. will begin reopening.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Or maybe let me ask this Joe if I can keep going. How do you think about cost mitigation efforts right? So everything is fluid I understand that the sales side of the things are fluid as well. To the extent to which that we continue to see some amount of degradation insert whatever that ultimately is here how do you think about your cost mitigation efforts in tandem at least as you see today through the course of this year?\nBill Spence: Yes. Go ahead Joe. You can follow-on with that one as well.\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. So, we certainly have levers that we can pull Julien as we do in typical years to face the challenges that we may see from weather or other headwinds. And obviously we had a weather impact a negative impact for the first quarter yet we still were confident in our forecast through the first quarter results. So, I think if you think of it in terms of our ability to manage in a weather year I think that's kind of what we were about $0.05 short of our business plan for the first quarter. I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact. And again given the recoverability nature of the U.K. with their decoupling mechanism it's really just a timing difference as we see it. So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective over the next two years we really don't see an impact. So, we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them. But of course I think we'll have the normal levers that we typically have. And then in addition to that just given the current situation we'll have things like travel, training, open positions across the company, and things like that that we'll take a look at as well.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. If I could just clarify the last response. And this has come up a little bit earlier but why not just fully elect -- I suppose this is part of the Ofgem construct itself but have some kind of accounting to fully elect for decoupling here given what seems sort of like an obvious transfer of value from one period to another. But ultimately that sounds basically canton on to decoupling. Is there any ability to actually reflect that in the ED2 process, or is it an accounting election or -- just to clarify there.\nJoe Bergstein: It's really\u2026\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Go ahead Joe.\nJoe Bergstein: Sorry. It's really just driven by the regulatory nature of the U.K. So, it's a revenue model so we don't have -- we don't get the advantage of regulatory accounting in -- under U.S. GAAP. So, it's not an election that we chose and it's not something that would necessarily change in ED2.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Okay, fair enough. I understand. Thank you all very much and best of luck. Stay safe.\nJoe Bergstein: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hey, good morning. Hope you all are doing well.\nJoe Bergstein: Good morning.\nStephen Byrd: Bill, congratulations on your retirement and Vince congrats on your new role. Look forward to working with you in your new role.\nBill Spence: Thanks very much.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you.\nStephen Byrd: I just wanted to -- a lot of topics have been covered but just hit on the U.K. pension. In the appendix you lay out the current funded status. And I guess you have a filing midyear with Ofgem. Would you mind just talking a little bit more about the approach to pension funding and just given where you stand or where you stood at March 31st sort of just at a high level what your thinking is around that pension funding?\nBill Spence: Sure. Joe do you want to take that one?\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. So our thinking around pension funding hasn't really changed as -- with respect to the Triennial Review process and future funding requirements from customers in the U.K. We were -- we had already embarked on that process. We work with the pension trustee first. We're largely through that process with them and then we move to the U.K. pension regulator and we're in that phase now. We're getting ready to kick off that phase of review with the regulator. We'll wrap that up and get to Ofgem and get approval from Ofgem later this year and get that in the November tariff for 2021. And so again our thinking there has not really changed with respect to the amount of funding required in the future from customers. As we talked about previously we expect that to decline by about $0.05 per share when we get to that period just from the funded status and the lower collection that's required over the next several years.\nStephen Byrd: Got it. Okay, good. That sounds like really nothing is changed there. Great. And then flipping just -- thinking about Kentucky. This is a broader question but just given solar economics continue to improve. And I was just curious sort of what you're seeing in terms of are we close to sort of tipping points where solar would become more attractive relative to your coal plants? And just whether or not we're at an inflection point or could be seen one, or if broadly your thinking is unchanged there as well in terms of just your generation mix and the change over time?\nBill Spence: Yeah. I think I'll start, and then Vince you can pick up and add any color you want. Overall, the solar costs, as you know, the curves are coming down. We are not quite at the inflection point at this point. It is getting closer. You see in the state a couple of things dynamically happening already. One is on the commercial/industrial front, we've gotten a lot more requests for solar options. Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small large customers as well and they are receiving those very well. The economics, at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time. Relative to the coal fleet, as I mentioned, we're still not at the inflection point. However, we do see that on the -- what I would say, the medium-term horizon might be in the next say couple of years to five years. We're beginning to think about how do we approach that from a -- not only from an economics standpoint, but also from an operational and generation mix standpoint going forward. So Vince, did you want to add anything to that?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah. Bill, I think I agree with those comments. In the short-term, we're not quite at the inflection point but we do have 100-megawatt RFP in with the commission currently right now requesting approval. As part of that we provided, a number of future scenarios around cost curves for both gas and coal as well as renewables. And over the long-term, the bulk of those scenarios would suggest that that solar contract is beneficial from a cost perspective but it does take a number of years to get there. So, depending on the time horizon, Stephen that you're looking at, it would really dictate whether you view renewables, particularly solar as economic in the state and that's exactly what we're going through with the commission right now.\nStephen Byrd: That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll look at that final raise one. Thank you very much.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning, team, and Bill and Vince, I also want to extend my congratulations to you both. Good luck, Bill, and Vince look forward to working with you.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you very much.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just -- yeah, sure absolutely. Joe, don't hate me, but I want to go back to the decoupling in the U.K. just so I understand this perfectly. So confirm or deny you are going to see a 2020 EPS hit, if sort of the demand destruction from COVID continues right? That's right, right? I mean you'll see and hit in EPS and then you recover it in 2021? I'm talking about calendar year 2020 versus calendar year 2021.\nJoe Bergstein: That's correct. And it would actually be recovered in two years sense. So it's really in the 2022 and 2023 time frame because there's a two year lag.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Perfect. And then, the -- so the so you've reaffirmed the guidance, so I'm assuming what is sort of built into that is any EPS hit from COVID in the U.K. will be offset by cost savings and other mitigation efforts.\nBill Spence: At this point, we -- it's early in the process. So it's really hard to predict exactly what levers we're going to pull to stay within the current range that we have. So the impact in the U.K. is the reason we didn't necessarily adjust the guidance. So the timing of the reopening is expected to be slower in the U.K. than what we're seeing here in the U.S. and we've got a better line of sight domestically to see how that opening looks like it's going to pan out where we don't have that in the U.K. So as a result of that, we didn't change our current range for earnings. So I guess it remains to be seen, which levers exactly we want to pull and particularly looking at the U.K. being two-thirds of the impact that will be the key thing to watch for us and for investors as the months go by here.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank, you guys.\nBill Spence: Okay. Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nBill Spence: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Good morning. Hey, congrats, Bill and Vince. Best of luck to both of you.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you.\nBill Spence: Thanks so much.\nSteve Fleishman: So just -- yes, you bet. And the different -- the monthly difference the $0.02 to $0.03 per load that you saw in April versus the $0.03 to $0.04 overall from COVID what is the other $0.01 or $0.01 to $0.02 just so I know?\nBill Spence: Sure. So Joe, do you want to cover that?\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. It's for other items that may be related to COVID, Steve. So we had additional interest expense relative to the original plan from the capital funding issuance that we did earlier that we did in April to shore up liquidity. If there's an extended severe lockdown situation we could see an increase in bad debt. So it's just to cover some other areas that may be outside of what you see just in load.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just to clarify in terms of the guidance for 2020, you're basically not -- you just don't know yet what the impact is and you need to follow it. You're not saying based on your view of the impact the range is good. You just don't know. So you're not saying either way. Is that fair?\nBill Spence: So yes, pretty much. I'd say we certainly still believe that our 2020 forecast can be achieved, which is why we didn't change it today. Reaffirming, I guess, in my mind implies a high degree of certainty and forecasting outcomes, which I think is challenging at this time being early on particularly with the more stringent restrictions that we're seeing in the U.K. and that lack of the line of sight that I mentioned not having that in the U.K. where -- versus where we are domestically where we at least know what the governors are thinking in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and we can kind of do a better job I think of predicting where things might land as we come out of COVID-19 lockdown in both those states whereas we don't have that just yet in the U.K. So I think we'll know obviously a lot more by the time we get to Q2. Fortunately, as we mentioned any hit in the U.K., which is expected to be our biggest hit, if we have one at least relative to 2020 earnings will be recoverable plus inflation in 2022 and 2023. So even if we ultimately have to alter our 2020 forecast due to lower sales in the U.K. economically, we're not going to be any worse off.\nSteve Fleishman: Right. And, I guess to summarize everything then given that aspect your comments about the dividend stability no matter what reflects any outcome of the pandemic?\nBill Spence: That's correct. Yes. At this time, I don't expect any change in our dividend strategy or policy as a result of COVID-19.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then the -- just then thinking about kind of credit and just I don't know if you talked to the agencies at all but given that economically U.K. protects you so well if your metrics are a little weaker this year, but then you get a boost that you know is going to happen two years from now. Are you -- do they kind of understand that in terms of...\nBill Spence: I believe they do and we've had some recent conversations with the rating agencies. And all those have gone well. Joe, I don't know if you want to add anything on the revenue side?\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. Sure. So we've been in regular dialogue with the rating agencies as they've been assessing the impact of COVID on the utility sector. And, of course, we were in touch with them ahead of our -- the PPL Cap Funding debt offering in April. They did not express any specific concerns as it relates to PPL. And of course we remain on stable outlook across the family of companies at both the agencies. And then I think Steve, you're exactly right from a credit metric perspective, first of all, we'd be able to expect -- we'd expect to be able to manage the near-term pressures from on our credit metrics as a result of COVID. But given the forward view of metrics and cash flows that the agencies have and their assessment of credit over a multiyear period and much of the expected impact that's going to come from the U.K. will be recovered over the period of time that they look at while assessing ratings and credit metrics. So we feel comfortable with that aspect as well.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nJoe Bergstein: You\u2019re welcome.\nBill Spence: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bill Spence for any closing remarks.\nBill Spence: Thank you operator and thanks to everyone for joining us today and all the best as you individually and collectively deal with the COVID-19. I wish you and your family's safety and health. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe and good morning, everyone. I'd first like to echo Bill's commentary on, how proud we are of our collective team's response to the challenges of COVID-19. There's no doubt that COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the way, we're operating the business. But as a company we acted early and aggressively to foster social distancing and minimize the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, I'm pleased to report, that we have not had any significant operational issues related to COVID-19. There's no denying, how vital our service is to our customers particularly in times of adversity and uncertainty. We are committed to be a source of stability at this time. And to continue to power their lives, regardless of the challenges that are thrown our way. Turning to slide 12, I want to take a moment to highlight some of the actions that we've taken to maintain that stability and reliability of service. We've taken extensive measures across PPL to protect our employees in the public, in order to deliver gas and electricity safely and reliably for our customers, as they cope with the challenges of COVID-19. But simply safety is our top priority. We are following comprehensive emergency management and pandemic plans as well as the guidance of the CDC and state and local health departments. The work at home and social distancing measures, that Bill discussed earlier, are core to our strategy. In addition, we've taken a number of other measures including temperature, testing we're using masks and gloves and enhancing our industrial cleaning. With our critical employees which are primarily the control room operators, we've split the crews into multiple teams where possible, having them work in different locations and with the work-from-home numbers that we have, we're able to enforce social distancing much better at our PPL facility. From a customer perspective, we are very focused on maintaining safety and reliability during these challenging times. And that starts with not cutting service to customers, and deferring the charging of late fees, which we and most utilities in the U.S. have agreed to do. In the U.K., while WPD does not bill the end-customer, we continue to work with a wider energy industry to consider liquidity issues, all focused on helping the end-consumer. Despite these changes to how we operate, it has been critically important to ensure our top-tier reliability remains unchanged. We had our first round of spring storms in all three of our jurisdictions. And we were able to restore power in all cases without any issues and without mutual assistant. These restoration efforts highlight the importance of preserving a strong supply chain. And we've increased our inventories for storm-related supply. Despite the lockdowns in our jurisdictions, we've been successful in getting our critical suppliers on the list of companies that are permitted to operate. As a result, we're well positioned with sufficient spares and supplies to operate effectively, even in the COVID environment. We're also scenario planning in the event this will continue for an extended period of time, to ensure we have adequate supplies and to assess the employee working arrangements that we've put in place, both on PPL premises and off. As Joe indicated we've already dialled back our U.K. capital spends to essential only work. But we are continuing to execute the original capital spends in the U.S. and expect to continue to do so. Having said that, based on the nature of our capital projects, we have the flexibility in the U.S. as well to defer capital spending into future periods, if necessary. In addition, our planned rate case calendar is relatively light, with no outstanding base rate cases in the U.S. and our current U.K. price control continues through March of 2023. Turning to slide 13, I covered the key points of our capital plan on the prior slide, but it's important to point out that a lot of our work in the U.K. is done on our customers' premises. So it's critically important for the safety of our employees to take a more conservative approach to work. And we're extremely pleased that Ofgem has been a great supporter of these efforts. At this point we expect any delayed asset replacement work and/or deferred asset reinforcement work, to be completed in future periods. Of course we'll continue to assess these needs in the context of our overall capital plan. And as we look at the deliverables we committed to both our customers and to Ofgem. Looking forward we do not expect the current environment to materially impact our overall capital plan. And we continue to see future investment opportunity, across the PPL portfolio with about $14 billion of CapEx projected in the next five years, focused on advancing a cleaner energy future. As discussed on our year-end call, we expect incremental CapEx opportunities of up to $500 million beyond the identified projects in our current plan. And longer-term, we continue to see significant opportunities with the electrification initiatives in the U.K. as well as the transition of our coal generation fleet in Kentucky. And finally, moving to slide 14 while we are certainly managing the current crisis at hand and ensuring that our customers and employees are protected, during these difficult times I want to further emphasize that we remain focused on the long-term strategy of the company. For PPL in many utilities that includes the transition to cleaner energy and we continue to position our utilities to fight climate change in a manner that balances the needs of our customers and the environment. PPL remains committed to our updated CO2 emission reduction targets announced earlier this year increasing our reduction target to at least 80% from 2010 levels by 2050. We are also showing a glide path that has already resulted in a 56% reduction in CO2 through the end of last year and at least a 70% reduction by 2040. I want to remind investors that these targets are based on current economics and technologies as well as current legislation and regulation. We believe these targets are credible and we are confident in our ability to achieve them. Of course, if there are further advancements in technology or the cost of renewables continues to come down we could certainly see even greater CO2 reduction than what we are currently targeting.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Bill for some closing remarks. Bill? Sure. And thanks Michael. I appreciate the congrats. So when we think about the U.S. right so Kentucky given the continued high level of investment that we're deploying not only in 2020, but also 2021 we would expect a need to file a rate case in Kentucky within the next year or so. To your point given just the current backdrop with COVID we are uncertain as to the timing of when we would file that next rate case. Our normal cadence that we've been on in Kentucky was basically every other year that would have suggested filing something at the end of this year with rates going into effect mid next year. But we are currently assessing that timing given COVID and just the backdrop there. For Pennsylvania, we don't have a rate case in the business plan through our guide period through at least 2021. I don't think COVID in and of itself would drive us to alter the timing of any rate case decisions in Pennsylvania. As Joe talked about in his remarks, when we looked at April's results, Pennsylvania was actually flat. So the residential load offset the C&I the negative impacts on C&I. So again, I think given the tariff structure in PA, I wouldn't say COVID is going to drive us to alter our current plan there in PA. Bill, you want me to take that one? Maybe just a couple of points. So to your point, Ofgem has indicated that they will issue the draft determinations for gas distribution and transmission at the end of July. So they are working hard to keep that timing. Also, in that Q2, Q3 time frame of this year, Ofgem was scheduled to get the ED2 sector methodology consultation out with the final methodology decision in Q4 of this year. That would feed our initial business plan submission in Q2 of next year. We are continuing to work towards that business plan submission for the middle of next year assuming that Ofgem will be on schedule with both the sector methodology consultation and then the final decision. I could see those slipping a little bit, but I think they would probably just contract the time. The overall time leading up to Q2 next year for the business plan submission. So, again, we're preparing to make sure that we can make that submission. Thanks Julien. Yes. Go ahead Joe. Thank you. Yeah. Bill, I think I agree with those comments. In the short-term, we're not quite at the inflection point but we do have 100-megawatt RFP in with the commission currently right now requesting approval. As part of that we provided, a number of future scenarios around cost curves for both gas and coal as well as renewables. And over the long-term, the bulk of those scenarios would suggest that that solar contract is beneficial from a cost perspective but it does take a number of years to get there. So, depending on the time horizon, Stephen that you're looking at, it would really dictate whether you view renewables, particularly solar as economic in the state and that's exactly what we're going through with the commission right now. Sure. You're welcome. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a brief overview of first quarter segment results on slide seven. As Bill mentioned, PPL delivered first quarter 2020 earnings from ongoing operations of $0.67 per share versus $0.70 per share in the first quarter of 2019. Walking from our Q1 2019 results on the left, we first make weather adjustments for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses. As felt across much of the U.S. during the first quarter, we experienced a very mild winter, which drove a $0.03 negative variance compared to Q1 2019 and about $0.05 variance to our forecast. Heating degree days were down by about 30% in Pennsylvania and 15% in Kentucky compared to normal weather conditions. We also adjust for the effects of dilution, primarily driven by the November 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts. Turning to the individual segment drivers, which exclude the impacts of these items, we'll begin first with the U.K. Our U.K. Regulated segment earned $0.39 per share, a $0.02 decrease compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in U.K. earnings was primarily due to lower other income due to lower pension income and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily driven by higher prices through the April 1, 2019 price increases. I'll note foreign currency was not a significant driver for Q1 based on the shape of our hedge portfolio. We remain substantially hedged for the balance of 2020 at an average hedge rate of $1.55 per pound. We'll see the benefit of higher hedge rates compared to 2019 in the balance of the year. Moving to Pennsylvania. We earned $0.16 per share, which was $0.02 higher than our comparable results for 2019. The increase was primarily driven to -- by higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investment and transmission. Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, we earned $0.16 per share, a $0.03 increase over our results one year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted gross margins, primarily resulting from higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 higher compared to a year ago driven by several factors none of which were individually significant. Turning to slide eight. As Bill noted, the company is well positioned to manage the challenges of COVID and we did not see material impacts to our financial results through the first quarter. With that said, there are a number of key areas of potential risk that we have been managing and continue to monitor. Our preliminary estimates reflect the monthly impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share based on April lockdowns. Importantly, we believe a substantial portion of these risks will be mitigated through constructive regulatory mechanisms, primarily U.K. decoupling. Breaking down the overall potential risk, starting with customer sales, we are seeing lower C&I volumes across the board given that each one of our jurisdictions have been operating under some form of mandatory lockdown. However, that has also driven strong increases in residential volumes that partially offset these declines. I'll touch on load specific sensitivities in each of our jurisdictions on the next slide but it's important to highlight that any impacts due to U.K. volume variances are fully recoverable in two years and are NPV neutral. Domestically, we have various fixed and demand charges, in our tariffs that helped to reduce the impact to changes in load and about 40% of our Pennsylvania margins come from transmission under a FERC formula rate. Regarding bad debts, our U.K. operations are very well insulated as we do not directly bill the end-use customer in the U.K. WPD bills about 150 suppliers with the largest seven suppliers comprising approximately two-thirds of those receivables. And as part of each U.K. supplier license agreement, these counterparties are required to post collateral in the form of letters of credit, escrow account deposits and cash deposits supporting the DNOs in the event of a supplier default. Turning to the U.S., while we have experienced some delayed payments, we haven't seen a material drop-off in cash received to date. We believe that is in part due to the unemployment and small business provisions in the stimulus packages approved by Congress. I'll also note that our commissions are encouraging customers to continue to pay their utility bills including contacting us directly for payment options. In the event we see the trend of delinquent payments rising to a significant level, we will explore regulatory mechanisms with our commissions to recover late or miss payments related to COVID-19. In regard to our capital plan in the U.S., we do not expect major changes to our plans and expect to complete as much of our planned capital work as possible with minimal notable delays experienced to date. In the U.K., the national shutdown ordered by Prime Minister Johnson has caused us to dial back capital spending to just the essential work focused on ensuring reliability and safety of our network. Ofgem has provided guidance, branding the network's flexibility in this area to prioritize our work accordingly. While we could see some modifications in our plan for 2020, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on our overall CapEx planned for RAV growth. We have the flexibility to shift some of the project to the back half of 2020 or into future periods, depending on the duration of the lockdown. As a reminder, under the favorable U.K. regulatory construct for rate making purposes, 80% of our projected tot-ex or total expenditures grows towards increasing the RAV and 20% is recovered as current period revenue. So shifting or deferring capital investment at least the amount we are talking about does not materially impact our RAV or our annual revenues. I'll cover our detailed liquidity update in a few moments but I'll just reaffirm Bill's comment on our strong position and confidence to manage a prolonged downturn. The recent actions we have taken plus the flexibility we have with our low-risk capital plan gives us further levers to pull to effectively manage the company's cash flow and liquidity through these challenges. Turning to Slide 9. We are providing an update and more detailed view of our load trends by customer class and related sensitivities to better reflect potential risks associated with any prolonged shutdown in our service territory. Of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share of monthly exposure that I mentioned on the prior slide, $0.02 to $0.03 is driven by load. And of that, about $0.02 is recoverable in future periods due to decoupling in the U.K. Based on our observations in April, we estimate the potential impact on C&I load is a decline of approximately 15% to 25% depending on the jurisdiction. The decline in C&I load is partially offset by stronger residential demand, where we observed 1% to 3% increases in the U.K. and 5% to 8% increases domestically. Given this load profile, we are projecting about two-thirds of the impact to come from the U.K. In April, this resulted in Kentucky margins, being off about $0.01 per share relative to our original business plan. In Pennsylvania, margins were flat to plan and we do not have WPD's results yet, given the normal lag in receiving that data from suppliers. If our projections are accurate, it would result in about a $0.02 impact for the U.K. for the month. On the right side of the slide, we provide an example of the U.K. decoupling mechanism. This is an essential part of the regulation that provides stability to our cash flows, supporting the low business risk profile from the credit rating agencies. One of the key points is that in addition to recovering the lost revenue from any declines in volume, we also receive inflation on top of those revenues to make us whole. So economically, we're very well protected in the U.K. from the potential impacts of COVID, weather or any volume-related variances despite any current year impact to earnings. Turning to Slide 10. I'd now like to take a moment and describe a number of steps we've taken to improve our liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty in the capital markets. As Bill mentioned, we are very well situated with about $5 billion, of total available liquidity, as we sit here today. During March and April, we secured term loan facilities of $400 million to 12-and 24-month durations. We also issued $1 billion of senior notes, at PPL Capital Funding, providing incremental liquidity and pre-funding the LKE maturity, we have in November of this year. We believe these positions the company very well from a liquidity perspective, for the remainder of 2020. While we have $700 million of additional debt maturities, at the operating companies in November. We believe we'll have the ability to access the capital markets to refinance that debt. That concludes my prepared remarks. And I'll turn the call to Vince, for a brief operational update. Vince? Sure. So, we're not projecting the full year impact at this time. As we have the estimate for April and as I've mentioned in prepared remarks, we don't have all of the data yet just as the normal lag in getting that information from suppliers. So it will be a little bit longer here till we get the actual results. We are starting to -- or the U.K. government is starting to talk about reopening businesses and C&I customers in the U.K. So we could see that number -- that impact number change as we move through the year. Regardless we would expect the same level of recoverability for any -- or the same ability to recover any shortfall later in the year. So trying to assess the full year impact at this time is a little difficult given the uncertainty as when -- as to when the U.K. will begin reopening. Sure. So, we certainly have levers that we can pull Julien as we do in typical years to face the challenges that we may see from weather or other headwinds. And obviously we had a weather impact a negative impact for the first quarter yet we still were confident in our forecast through the first quarter results. So, I think if you think of it in terms of our ability to manage in a weather year I think that's kind of what we were about $0.05 short of our business plan for the first quarter. I think at least we have that level of opportunity as we move through the balance of the year. Ultimately, we'll have to assess the full impact. And again given the recoverability nature of the U.K. with their decoupling mechanism it's really just a timing difference as we see it. So from a cash flow or credit or dividend perspective over the next two years we really don't see an impact. So, we'll have to just continue to assess the situation and the impact as we move through the balance of the year and decide which levers and how we want to flex them. But of course I think we'll have the normal levers that we typically have. And then in addition to that just given the current situation we'll have things like travel, training, open positions across the company, and things like that that we'll take a look at as well. It's really... Sorry. It's really just driven by the regulatory nature of the U.K. So, it's a revenue model so we don't have -- we don't get the advantage of regulatory accounting in -- under U.S. GAAP. So, it's not an election that we chose and it's not something that would necessarily change in ED2. Thanks very much. Good morning. Sure. So our thinking around pension funding hasn't really changed as -- with respect to the Triennial Review process and future funding requirements from customers in the U.K. We were -- we had already embarked on that process. We work with the pension trustee first. We're largely through that process with them and then we move to the U.K. pension regulator and we're in that phase now. We're getting ready to kick off that phase of review with the regulator. We'll wrap that up and get to Ofgem and get approval from Ofgem later this year and get that in the November tariff for 2021. And so again our thinking there has not really changed with respect to the amount of funding required in the future from customers. As we talked about previously we expect that to decline by about $0.05 per share when we get to that period just from the funded status and the lower collection that's required over the next several years. That's correct. And it would actually be recovered in two years sense. So it's really in the 2022 and 2023 time frame because there's a two year lag. Sure. It's for other items that may be related to COVID, Steve. So we had additional interest expense relative to the original plan from the capital funding issuance that we did earlier that we did in April to shore up liquidity. If there's an extended severe lockdown situation we could see an increase in bad debt. So it's just to cover some other areas that may be outside of what you see just in load. Sure. Sure. So we've been in regular dialogue with the rating agencies as they've been assessing the impact of COVID on the utility sector. And, of course, we were in touch with them ahead of our -- the PPL Cap Funding debt offering in April. They did not express any specific concerns as it relates to PPL. And of course we remain on stable outlook across the family of companies at both the agencies. And then I think Steve, you're exactly right from a credit metric perspective, first of all, we'd be able to expect -- we'd expect to be able to manage the near-term pressures from on our credit metrics as a result of COVID. But given the forward view of metrics and cash flows that the agencies have and their assessment of credit over a multiyear period and much of the expected impact that's going to come from the U.K. will be recovered over the period of time that they look at while assessing ratings and credit metrics. So we feel comfortable with that aspect as well. You're welcome."

            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you've joined us for our first quarter earnings call. With me today are Vince Sorgi, PPL's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Moving to slide 3, I'll begin this morning's call with an executive overview, including our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and PPL's strong position in the face of this challenge. Joe will then provide a more detailed review of first quarter earnings and discuss our approach to managing certain financial risks relating to COVID. Then Vince will take a few moments on how we are maintaining our safe and reliable operations and focus on PPL's long-term strategy. As always, we'll leave ample time to answer your questions. Turning to slide 4, I'm extremely proud of our team's response to the pandemic, which was early and aggressive. This proactive approach helped us adapt quickly to ensure that we continue to provide safe and reliable services during these challenging times. Importantly, we have been able to keep electricity and gas flowing to our over 10 million customers, despite the extensive measures necessary to protect our employees and our communities. First and foremost, we've taken steps to practice social distancing in all of our operations. This has included shifting almost 40% of our workforce to work-from-home. That represents more than 4,500 employees, and it has included creating additional separation for those who must still report to a PPL facility due to the nature of their job. These measures have proven effective as we've had just a handful of positive COVID-19 cases across our company. These encouraging results are in part due to the substantial investments we've made, which enable our staff to complete a lot of the work remotely and without direct interaction with customers. And in those cases where our employees need to enter our customer premises we've ensured our employees have the proper equipment to keep them safe. We've experienced shutdowns of nonessential businesses across the regions we serve, which has supported our social distancing effort. In all of our jurisdictions, the support by our local trade union has been fantastic. As we've worked in true partnership to protect our workers and the public. And it's a testament to our employee whose patience, persistence and professionalism continues to shine through in these unprecedented times. Importantly, we continue to deliver an essential service for our customers when they need us most especially the health care facilities that are literally on the frontline fighting this pandemic. As we focus on meeting our customers' needs, we also remain well-positioned to manage an extended economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. This is a reflection of the low risk, adaptable, great regulated business model that we have strategically built over the past decade. We have a strong liquidity position and took further steps to strengthen our financial position, demonstrating our abilities to access the capital markets, which Joe will discuss more in a few moments. We also have substantial flexibility in our capital plan without major project risk, which enables us to be agile and focused on the immediate needs of our customers shifting noncritical work without significant implications to our overall capital plan. In short, we are confident in our ability to weather the storm as we confront the challenge of COVID-19. Lastly, I would note that we are committed to supporting customers who may be struggling financially through these difficult times. Our foundations in Pennsylvania and Kentucky along with our U.K. business have pledged $1.6 million combined in donations to coronavirus relief funds and programs that help customers with financial hardship. Our companies have also suspended disconnect and late fees and worked to connect -- reconnect customers who had previously been disconnected. In addition, we continue to offer payment assisted programs and other services to help customers manage their energy bills. We know the road won't be easy for many and we will continue to look for opportunities to support our local communities going forward. Now turning to slide 5, today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.72 per share compared with $0.64 per share during the same period a year ago. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.60 per -- $0.67 per share compared to $0.70 per share a year ago. The decrease was driven largely by $0.04 of dilution and lower sales volumes, primarily due to the mild weather in the first quarter. These factors were partially offset by returns on our additional capital investment. Turning to the full year, w have not changed our 2020 forecast of $2.40 a share to $2.60 per share. And while we're on track through the first quarter with minimal impact from COVID, we have largely been under a lockdown for the past six weeks. This has resulted in lower C&I load and higher residential loads in all of our jurisdiction. At this point, it is too early to predict clearly what the pandemic impact will be on full year results. This will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, the pace and extent of the economic recovery and the degree companies continue in employ work-from-home protocols which is what's driving the higher residential loads. Given these uncertainties and how early we are in the process, we are providing sensitivities in today's material which Joe will cover in more detail in his remarks. We felt it was more helpful and transparent to provide sensitivities that allow shareowners and analysts to assess the potential impact as time goes on. As you'll see in our sensitivity analysis, the monthly impact may be manageable, especially if the economies in our jurisdictions recover quickly and we see more favorable weather coupled with other levers that we can pull. So while we're bringing stability to our communities and customers in the face of unprecedented challenges, we also remain confident in our long-term prospects for our shareowners including our 2021 forecast. We see minimal if any impact to our capital and rate-based growth plans and we maintain an attractive dividend and a strong investment-grade rate credit rating. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a financial update. Thanks, Vince. I'd like to take a moment now to reiterate that PPL remains well positioned for the future. Our strong financial profile consisting of a significant liquidity position and low-risk capital plan will enable us to manage through an extended economic downturn. Our commitment to exceptional operational performance and customer satisfaction shines bright as we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas during this period of uncertainty. We remain steadfast in our goals to advance the cleaner energy future and delivering on commitments to share owner. In closing, I would note that this will be the last earnings call led by me as PPL's Chief Executive Officer. As we announced in February, I will be retiring as CEO on June 1, and will become non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Vince will become President and CEO of PPL at that time. It has truly been an honor to lead a tremendous team of employees we have here at PPL. They are among the very best our industry has to offer. They are talented, creative, caring and hardworking. And above all they are dedicated to making life better for our customers and our community. As we look to the future, I'm confident that the company will be in good hands led by Vince guided by an outstanding management team supported by more than 12,000 strong in the U.S. and U.K. and poised to deliver for our share owners moving forward. Lastly, we talked at length today about the challenge of COVID-19 and PPL's response. And I think it's worth noting that PPL has delivered power safely and reliably for the communities we serve for 100 years overcoming many difficult challenges in that time. Through World War II, the Great Depression, hurricanes, snowstorms and more generations of PPL employees have answered the call with grid determination and creativity. I have no doubt we will continue to do the same once again in the face of this new and unprecedented challenge. With that, operator let's open the call for questions please. Sure. Good question, Michael. And thanks for the comments early on there. Vince, do you want to handle that one, but I think you've set up the question well Michael in terms of some of those trade-offs. But Vince you can probably comment. Sure. Really... I'll start and then if you want to supplement hence that would be fine. Really, we don't expect Michael any impact -- any material impact on the RIIO-ED2 schedule at this point. Our understanding and we've been in constant contact mostly because of COVID-19 operational issues, but in constant contact with Ofgem. And they -- in our last conversation with them indicated that as it relates to the gas and transmission proceedings they are continuing on and they still expect to issue a decision in the summer. As it relates to the electric distribution, as you know there is still a lot of work that's scheduled for 2021 and 2022. This year's were -- at least as it relates to the electric distribution segment is still going forward obviously virtually versus face to face, but we don't really expect this to have any material impact on the timing. Of course, if the COVID-19 pandemic were to go out in time for a much more extended time frame that could change. But right now, it looks like we're still on track. Vince, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add there. Yes that's correct Michael. Thanks Julien. Yes sure. So, fortunately we are going to recover all the volume impacts as we see it from 2020 COVID-19. Volumes will be recoverable plus inflation in '22 and '23 as you noted. So, even if we ultimately would have to alter the 2020 forecast due to lower sales in the U.K., economically we'd be no worse off for our investors. So very fortunate to have that mechanism and it is two-thirds of the impact so it is notable in terms of its impact. Joe do you want to comment specifically on our expectation regarding a full year impact what that could be based on the sensitivities we provided? Yes. Go ahead Joe. You can follow-on with that one as well. Thanks very much. Sure. Joe do you want to take that one? Yeah. I think I'll start, and then Vince you can pick up and add any color you want. Overall, the solar costs, as you know, the curves are coming down. We are not quite at the inflection point at this point. It is getting closer. You see in the state a couple of things dynamically happening already. One is on the commercial/industrial front, we've gotten a lot more requests for solar options. Fortunately, we've been able to provide those to both small large customers as well and they are receiving those very well. The economics, at least in their view, have gotten close enough that they believe based on their own corporate environmental objectives and the economics that it makes sense for them to begin placing solar on their facilities at this time. Relative to the coal fleet, as I mentioned, we're still not at the inflection point. However, we do see that on the -- what I would say, the medium-term horizon might be in the next say couple of years to five years. We're beginning to think about how do we approach that from a -- not only from an economics standpoint, but also from an operational and generation mix standpoint going forward. So Vince, did you want to add anything to that? At this point, we -- it's early in the process. So it's really hard to predict exactly what levers we're going to pull to stay within the current range that we have. So the impact in the U.K. is the reason we didn't necessarily adjust the guidance. So the timing of the reopening is expected to be slower in the U.K. than what we're seeing here in the U.S. and we've got a better line of sight domestically to see how that opening looks like it's going to pan out where we don't have that in the U.K. So as a result of that, we didn't change our current range for earnings. So I guess it remains to be seen, which levers exactly we want to pull and particularly looking at the U.K. being two-thirds of the impact that will be the key thing to watch for us and for investors as the months go by here. Okay. Sure. Good morning, Steve. Thanks so much. Sure. So Joe, do you want to cover that? So yes, pretty much. I'd say we certainly still believe that our 2020 forecast can be achieved, which is why we didn't change it today. Reaffirming, I guess, in my mind implies a high degree of certainty and forecasting outcomes, which I think is challenging at this time being early on particularly with the more stringent restrictions that we're seeing in the U.K. and that lack of the line of sight that I mentioned not having that in the U.K. where -- versus where we are domestically where we at least know what the governors are thinking in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and we can kind of do a better job I think of predicting where things might land as we come out of COVID-19 lockdown in both those states whereas we don't have that just yet in the U.K. So I think we'll know obviously a lot more by the time we get to Q2. Fortunately, as we mentioned any hit in the U.K., which is expected to be our biggest hit, if we have one at least relative to 2020 earnings will be recoverable plus inflation in 2022 and 2023. So even if we ultimately have to alter our 2020 forecast due to lower sales in the U.K. economically, we're not going to be any worse off. That's correct. Yes. At this time, I don't expect any change in our dividend strategy or policy as a result of COVID-19. I believe they do and we've had some recent conversations with the rating agencies. And all those have gone well. Joe, I don't know if you want to add anything on the revenue side? Thank you, Steve. Thank you operator and thanks to everyone for joining us today and all the best as you individually and collectively deal with the COVID-19. I wish you and your family's safety and health. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. Before we get started, I will draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation and earnings release, which we will discuss during today\u2019s call contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operation and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. Participating on our call this morning are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg Dudkin, Chief Operating Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our 2021 year end earnings call. Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today\u2019s call, I will begin this morning with an overview of 2021 and what was clearly a significant transition year for PPL. I will highlight key achievements we made throughout the year, including our progress in strategically repositioning PPL for future growth and success. Joe will provide a financial update including the previously discussed reset of our first quarter dividend we announced this morning and a detailed overview of our 2021 financial results. And as always, we will leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4, I am incredibly proud of how our team performed in what was truly a remarkable year for PPL. As we began a new century in our company\u2019s history, we took bold steps to strategically reposition PPL as a U.S. focused energy company, committed to sustainable growth and well-positioned to lead the clean energy transition, while maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. We completed the sale of our UK utility business in June, achieving exceptional value at almost $11 billion while eliminating risks associated with foreign operations. We then took steps to strengthen PPL\u2019s balance sheet by reducing $3.5 billion of our holding company debt, which provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward. We advanced our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric, which will expand and diversify our U.S. presence, add another high-quality regulated utility to our portfolio, and create additional opportunities to leverage our proven operating model to drive value for customers and shareowners. We anticipate receiving a final order from the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers with respect to the acquisition by March of 2022. While the strategic repositioning was a key priority in 2021 to set PPL up for long-term success, we also remained focused on achieving our near-term objectives. In 2021, we continued our track record of earning equity returns that were in line with those allowed by our regulators. We also achieved constructive regulatory outcomes in 2021, with the settlements on the Pennsylvania FERC ROE challenge and the rate case in Kentucky, which will provide added stability and predictability to our plan over the next several years. We also returned over $2 billion to shareowners through dividends as well as share repurchases, which included the completion of our targeted $1 billion in share buybacks through December 31. And true to our mission, we delivered energy safely, reliably and affordably for our 2.5 million customers in the United States. And as the pandemic refused to yield, we stayed resilient, acted responsibly to protect our employees and remained focused on continuous improvement. From Kentucky to Pennsylvania, we delivered exceptional service throughout 2021. We maintained transmission and distribution reliability as well as generation availability that was among the best in the industry. Despite PPL Electric Utilities experiencing significant storms during 2021, it maintained top quartile performance for Seifi, which measures the average number of outages our customers experience. Meanwhile, our Kentucky operations posted their second best year on record for safety. When severe weather struck either in Pennsylvania or Kentucky, we responded quickly and effectively. For example, after December tornadoes, tour through portions of our service territory in Kentucky, damaging or destroying more than 500 transmission and distribution poles, we restored power to most customers within 48 hours. Similarly, when the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through our Pennsylvania service territory, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers, we mobilized quickly and effectively to get the lights back on as soon as possible. Our restoration performance in the wake of Hurricane Ida was recognized with an EEI Emergency Response Award. This performance is the result of the investments we have made in our grid and our dedicated employees who pride themselves on delivering the superior level of service each day. And that service was once again reflected in our customer satisfaction scores. We were honored to receive 4 new J.D. Power awards in 2021 for electric utility residential and business customer satisfaction, with PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both ranking highest among similarly sized utilities in their respective regions. And following an independent survey of customers at 140 of the largest utilities in the U.S., PPL Electric and Kentucky Utilities were recognized by Escalent as two of the most trusted utility brands in the nation. Across PPL, we also continue to foster a culture of innovation, investing in advanced technology and data analytics to deliver industry leading reliability and enterprise-wide cost efficiencies. This resulted in multiple industry awards in 2021, including the use of dynamic line rating, technology and the use of data analytics to better target vegetation management. With an eye towards keeping reliability strong and empowering our customers, we also continue to invest in the future. This included executing more than $2 billion in infrastructure improvements to further strengthen grid resilience, modernize our network, incorporate advanced technology and pave the way for increased electrification and renewable energy in our service territories. Turning to Slide 5, over the past year, we also delivered on our commitments to deliver a sustainable PPL for our shareowners, employees and the communities we serve. We made significant progress in advancing our clean energy strategy. We adopted a net zero carbon emissions goal, accelerated our interim emissions reduction targets to 70% from 2010 levels by 2035, and 80% by 2040. And we also accelerated our coal plant retirement schedule. Separately, we announced a commitment of over $50 million in new investments to fund research and development in the clean energy space with our planned investments in EIP and EPRI\u2019s low carbon resources initiative. We also launched a new partnership to study carbon capture at natural gas combined cycle power plants and reached new agreements to provide an additional 125 megawatts of solar power to major Kentucky customers. In November, we published our latest Comprehensive Climate Assessment report, which highlights the risks associated with climate change and the opportunities in responding to it and evaluate potential of future emissions under multiple scenarios. This included a scenario consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our climate assessment outlines our clean energy strategy and goals to enable a responsible transition that balances our commitments to the environment, our customers, our employees and our communities. LG and KU also submitted their Triannual Joint Integrated Resource Plan, which reflected a significant increase in projected renewable additions in the 15-year planning horizon compared to our prior plan. We expect the trend of a more rapid decarbonization of our generation fleet in Kentucky to continue with further improvements in cost and technology for renewables as well as other clean energy technologies. In addition to our focus on advancing our clean energy transition, we also remained very engaged in the communities we serve and with our employees throughout 2021. We continue to move PPL forward by creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We implemented an enterprise-wide diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, adopted DEI commitments, increased diversity within our leadership rank, overall workforce and the board and we expanded our support for social justice and equity initiatives in the communities we serve. In addition, we continue to create new opportunities through business resource groups for employees of all backgrounds and experiences to collaborate, share perspectives and contribute to PPL\u2019s success. Our strong commitment to diverse and inclusion received recognition for multiple organizations in 2021, with PPL being named the Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality and Disability Inclusion as well as a top company for ESG. In this January, PPL once again was named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality, marking the sixth straight year PPL has received this recognition. During our fall giving campaigns, PPL employees and retirees collectively raised more money than ever before, more than $7 million in individual pledges and corporate matching contributions that will help lift individuals, families and communities. And in the aftermath of the Kentucky tornadoes, we responded quickly providing financial support to assist Kentucky families and businesses. In other highlights, we continued to build an exceptional management team that we believe will lead PPL to its best years to come. We promoted Greg Dudkin to Chief Operating Officer and are leveraging his experience in building one of the most advanced utilities in the nation in PPL Electric Utilities to drive further value for stakeholders across all of PPL\u2019s operating companies. We are extremely excited to have Wendy Stark on our team as our new General Counsel. Wendy\u2019s extensive experience in regulatory matters and her deep knowledge of our industry have made her a great addition to PPL. We named two new utility presidents in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with Stephanie Raymond in Pennsylvania and John Crockett in Kentucky. Stephanie is the first female utility president in our company\u2019s 100-year history. We also named a highly qualified and experienced leadership team in Rhode Island led by Dave Bonenberger from PPL and numerous talented employees from National Grid to lead our electric and gas operations pending the completion of the acquisition. We also took steps to strengthen our corporate governance during the year. Our Board of Directors appointed an outstanding leader and experienced board member as Independent Board Chair in Craig Rogerson, reflecting PPL\u2019s continued commitment to strong corporate governance and independent oversight by a diverse, engaged board. And Heather Redman, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners was a welcomed addition to our highly experienced Board of Directors and brings a wealth of expertise in disruptive technologies and the energy industry. In summary, across our business, we made tremendous progress in 2021 as we pursued our strategy to deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders and position PPL for future growth and success. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 for the financial update. Today, we announced fourth quarter reported earnings of $0.18 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.04 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric and discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business. Adjusting for special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.22 per share. Our fourth quarter results bring our total 2021 results to a net loss of $1.93 per share. Special items for 2021 were $2.98 per share, primarily due to discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business, a UK tax rate change prior to the sale and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt. Adjusting for special items, 2021 earnings from ongoing operations were $1.05 per share. Before turning to the 2021 earnings walk, I will highlight a few other financial updates. The most notable being the first quarter dividend we announced this morning. As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, we plan to update the dividend following the January 3 payment as we continued to progress on PPL\u2019s strategic repositioning. Recall that we had maintained the dividend at the prior rate despite the sale of WPD, providing $350 million of dividends to reward long-term shareowners as we work to close the transactions and deploy the cash proceeds from the WPD sale in a value-accretive manner. Today, we have announced the first quarter 2022 dividend of $0.20 per share payable April 1. The updated quarterly dividend aligns with our earnings projections for PPL\u2019s current businesses and a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 65%. We plan to provide an updated annualized dividend rate and growth projections to align with earnings growth during an Investor Day following the completion of the Narragansett regulatory review process. We recognize that it would have been optimal to declare the April 1 dividend when we provide our annualized earnings forecast. However, since we haven\u2019t completed the Narragansett regulatory review process, we wanted to be transparent today by providing clarity on the dividend reset following the sale of WPD. We plan to reflect any increase in the dividend due to the inclusion of Narragansett in our forecast when we provide a comprehensive financial update at the Investor Day. As Vince noted, one of the key financial highlights for 2021 was a reduction in our holding company debt as we allocated a significant amount of the WPD sales proceeds to strengthen PPL\u2019s balance sheet. We had a unique opportunity to establish one of the leading credit profiles in the sector, an attribute we see is increasingly important with the growing capital needs to fund the clean energy transition and now amid the backdrop of rising interest rates. In other financial updates, we amended and extended our credit facilities during the fourth quarter to better align our liquidity needs post the strategic repositioning. In short, we slightly reduced the capacity at PPL Capital funding to $1.25 billion from $1.45 billion as we no longer need the same level of liquidity without the foreign currency risk associated with the UK. We have also included an option to add an Narragansett as a co-borrower to the PPL Capital funding credit facility, pending the closing of the acquisition. And we continue to target 16% to 18% CFO and FFO to debt metrics, including the Narragansett Electric acquisition. We believe these actions provide a very strong financial foundation and place PPL among the best credit profiles in our industry. Let\u2019s move to our full year 2021 earnings results on Slide 8. I would note that while I will compare 2021 earnings to our 2020 results, the periods are not truly comparable given the sale of the UK businesses, the reallocation of certain costs, the balance sheet recapitalization along with the outcome of the transmission ROE challenge. Similar to prior quarters, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate other amount to reflect certain costs previously allocated to the UK regulated segment, primarily interest expense and other support costs. These costs totaled about $0.07 per share for the year. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.61 per share, a $0.04 year-over-year decrease. Earnings results in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity, lower peak transmission demand and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.61 per share in 2021. A $0.06 increase over comparable results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, and lower interest expense primarily due to lower interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment and lower interest rates, partially offsetting these items were higher operation and maintenance expense, related to several factors, including support costs, generation plant costs, T&D costs and higher depreciation due to the additions to PP&E. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other, primarily included lower interest expense primarily due to less outstanding long-term holding company debt, partially offset by interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky segment, partially offsetting this increase were several factors that were not individually significant. Moving to Slide 9. The capital investments made in Pennsylvania and Kentucky during 2021, support grid modernization, grid resiliency and reliability and improved service for our customers. Of the $2 billion of CapEx that Vince noted, we invested about $1 billion in each of the segments. In Pennsylvania, investments in distribution were made to maintain top quartile industry reliability and performance and investments in more advanced IT systems. Meanwhile, on the transmission side, investments were primarily related to asset health and reliability with a focus on smart relays, equipment monitoring and automation to support a more advanced grid. Our Kentucky investments were primarily related to replacing aging transmission infrastructure, maintaining and enhancing our electric distribution network, generation outages, environmental compliance and grid modernization. This resulted in total rate base growth of nearly 6% even as rate base related to our coal-fired generation facilities declined. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince for some closing comments.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, 2021 was very much a transition year for PPL. It was about reimagining PPL and laying a firm foundation for the company\u2019s future growth and success, and I believe we achieved just that. Looking forward, our focus is on completing the acquisition of Narragansett Electric and introducing a new PPL to shareowners, a PPL that is committed to delivering sustainable value for share owners, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the U.S. utility sector, distinguished by its best-in-class customer service. Committed to net-zero carbon emissions and well positioned to lead the clean energy transition, while maintaining affordable, reliable service for our customers. We look forward to sharing further details on our strategy and the exciting growth prospects for the new PPL at our Investor Day.\nAndy Ludwig: With that, operator, let\u2019s open the call to Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hi, good morning, guys.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: So Vince, perhaps if we can just start on the process in Rhode Island. It seems like there is been some noise around things like cost and mutual assistance versus grid\u2019s ownership in the docket. Any kind of color you can provide around your interactions as the decision target date approaches by the end of this month?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, sure. First of all, let me just say that we think we\u2019ve met the standard for approval in the state, and we are looking forward to the decision coming out from the division. And Again, as we stated really from the outset of this process, we believe that PPL is uniquely positioned to serve lot customers at this point in time. When you look at our long history of providing energy safely, reliably, affordably for our customers, we consistently rank among the very best for customer satisfaction. We\u2019ve been a clear leader in developing and deploying the kind of smart grid technology that\u2019s going to be critical to helping Rhode Island meet their very ambitious decarbonization goals. And with the additional commitments that we\u2019ve made, we believe the transaction is clearly in the public interest in Rhode Island. So I\u2019ll just reiterate that we believe we\u2019ve met the standard, and we\u2019re looking forward to the decision.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. So I get it. So just there is a high level of confidence that going to close. Okay. And then just, Vince, you completed the $1 billion buybacks, right, increased CapEx by $1 billion at EEI, could we just check back on the remaining amount of unallocated cash here? And how you\u2019re thinking about the toggle allocation between buybacks and more CapEx in light of the current DPS guidance?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Shar. I would say we don\u2019t have a detailed update on that. We will provide a full update at the Investor Day. Really it\u2019s important that we get through the regulatory process in Rhode Island, of course, we\u2019ve made some commitments as part of the process to mainly to make sure we factor all of that into the proteins discussion, and we will update with the full update on the Investor Day call.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Understood. And then just on a little bit more of a minor thing, maybe just \u2013 can you comment on the Safari sale process? I mean it seems like there was some interest there previously. I guess, what drove the decision to put it on the block and any material amount of cash expected there?\nVince Sorgi: Well, Shar, as you know, we are not going to comment on market rumors, so...\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Try to get past you, Vince, but you are too good. Alright, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning.\nPaul Zimbardo: I know you commented a little bit on it, Joe, but just on the decision around the dividend and the timing now versus maybe wait until you have clarity in a month or so, just any perspective there? And it sounds like the plan would be more of a kind of a one-time bump assuming Narragansett closes versus a faster growth rate on the dividend. But just any perspective you can provide there would be helpful?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, sure, Paul. While it\u2019s certainly possible that we will receive the decision as early as next week from the division, we\u2019re not certain in that, and we are still in the middle of the regulatory approval process. And as we discussed on the third quarter call, we did want to reduce the uncertainty related to the anticipated reset of the dividend following the UK sale. And just without the firm time line for the Rhode Island transaction, we just felt it was appropriate to keep our normal cadence, which as you know, we would normally announce our first quarter dividend on our call, on our year end call. And so as we were contemplating whether to move from that normal cadence and potentially hold off the call. We also realized that if we didn\u2019t do it today, we actually risk ended up doing it in 8K, which would not be the preferred approach, of course. So we wanted to make sure that we could provide an opportunity for questions around what we\u2019ve said. And that was really the nature of the decision to announce it today versus leading. And then in terms of the second part of your question, as Joe noted, the Q1 dividend is based on our current operations only, and we would plan to increase that following the closing of the Narragansett transaction. And again, we will provide that full update once we close the deal and then conduct the Analyst Day for the investor call.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. And then One last question on the strategic corporate initiative costs you incurred in the quarter, particularly at Kentucky as well as just the corporate overall? Just what\u2019s the thought process there? And is there anything you\u2019re considering specifically with that Kentucky property?\nVince Sorgi: Joe, you want to\u2026\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. No. I think the costs associated with the strategic repositioning were normal and interrelated to the Narragansett acquisition, really, the amount that\u2019s associated with Kentucky is really immaterial. Nothing related to any strategic colonic Kentucky. It\u2019s all essentially for the Narragansett acquisition.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thank you, have a nice weekend.\nJoe Bergstein: Thanks, you too.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Paul\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi, team. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I know there is \u2013 good morning. I know there is an update coming post the Narragansett transaction. But just so we have the numbers right. Am I right that with the share buybacks, and I\u2019m focused on the leftover cash. With the share buybacks and the additional CapEx announced at the U.S. utilities, you still have roughly about $1 billion left to allocate? Do I have that number right?\nJoe Bergstein: Well, we will get into the total use of proceeds and any \u2013 and how that\u2019s utilized when we get to the Investor Day.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then just one, and you may not be able to answer this also, but I\u2019ll just ask, is the sort of 2022 going to be the base year for any term \u2013 any long-term projections that you give out or long-term earnings growth target that you gave out?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, that\u2019s the plan, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay, thank you, guys. Appreciate the time.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hello. Can you hear me?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, we can.\nPaul Patterson: So, just to sort of follow-up on this, when \u2013 I guess, how should we think of \u2013 I mean, I know you guys are obviously feeling confident about the arrogance closure, but it doesn\u2019t appear that there is any settlement. And it appears that there is some uncertainty just generically speaking, hence, sort of the dividend action that you guys have been describing. How should we think about what the scenario would be if the deal doesn\u2019t come about if you don\u2019t get approval for it?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Paul, I don\u2019t really want to talk about some hypotheticals. We are really focused. Again, I will just go back to what I said to Shar, we think we have clearly met the standard for approval in the state with what we bring to the table in terms of our operating experience, the financial strength of our company, of course, commitments that we have made throughout the process there. So, we and National Grid are very focused on getting to closing. We spent the last year on transition planning, integration planning, hiring or getting 1,100 people like NFI and ready to start on day one. We are all very focused on getting this deal over the goal line and bringing real value to our line.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. But given the idea that the target date, and again, I mean are you hearing \u2013 let me ask you this, are you hearing that there is any change in the target date decision, because that\u2019s just a week away, and it would seem to me that with the dividend action, everything that perhaps you could have sort of waited to do the earnings release and everything else, unless you think that there is maybe a potential that, that target date isn\u2019t \u2013 that is going to be pushed back or something? How should we think about when we are going to get more clarity of Rhode Island? Is it still the target date kind of thing, or is there something else we should think about?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Look, Paul, I think based on the schedule that we have, right, the targeted decision date is the 25th. But we just \u2013 we recognize that there is a lot in this case through the written testimony Greece, the oral hearings. We just want to recognize the fact that the 25th is a target. And there is a lot that the hearing officer and the division need to get through. And so there has been no change in the 25th as the target. But we are just trying to be realistic that there is no guarantee that we are going to get.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. I actually wanted to just ask about Pennsylvania and Kentucky items. First, in Kentucky, can you remind us as a result of the IRP, when the material fleet generation changes or transformation would likely play out over that extended timeframe. Like what happens in the next 3 years to 5 years, what happens in the years 6 to 15?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So, we have the next round of retirements, you may recall, in 2024. Based on our reserve margins, we don\u2019t anticipate a significant need to replace generation for those retirements. The next group would be in 2028. We would need to replace the 2028 retirements. And so probably see capital start to be spent in the 2026-ish timeframe for that. And then the next round of retirements are this side of 2035. So, I think in 2034, \u201835-ish. And so you will see the capital in the early \u201830s to prepare for those.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And given the move in commodity prices, both natural gas, power and coal, you see for the next couple of years, your co-plants actually running at a higher capacity factor in Kentucky than maybe what you had seen previously, or is there an opportunity to maybe save O&M and scale back the output levels of that source and either run gas units more or buy more power from the market.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, it\u2019s a good question. So, as you know, we are incredibly focused on decarbonizing the overall generation fleet. But we you bring up a good point around the cost of natural gas versus the cost of coal. So, as we think about it, Michael, we will continue to look at how we best utilize the fleet to ensure reliability for the lowest cost for customers, but at the same time, decarbonizing, so that could be additional renewables \u2013 renewable PPAs or on renewals. We are always looking at \u2013 does it make sense to shift between natural gas and coal or so. And those are all things that we continue to iterate as we look at the decarbonization \u2013 the overall decarbonization strategy for the quality.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And then one last question, can you just remind me, I remember I think I remember correctly, smart meter implementation in the company, it\u2019s been a while. But did Kentucky have a similar level of that relative to the other prospects in Pennsylvania?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, we have done two rounds of smart meter deployment in Pennsylvania. We are doing our initial deployment in Kentucky. We are expecting that to be completed in 2026. And then you haven\u2019t asked, but in Rhode Island, they don\u2019t have smart meters, but that would be something we would be deploying very quickly after acquisition in as well.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Thanks. I appreciate it. I have got a few questions, Vince. So, I guess first of all, I thought you had said in the past that you were going to use like a pro forma base for your growth rate, including like a full year of it NEC, not just 2022. Is that correct, or are you going to use 2022 calendar year?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Sorry, if I wasn\u2019t clear on that with your earlier response. Yes, we think it would be 2022\u2019s pro forma.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And just you have a new dividend and you gave a payout ratio, so you can kind of back into what earnings power from the core businesses roughly are expected to be without NEC, is that like a fair representation of 2022 core businesses without NEC?\nVince Sorgi: That\u2019s reasonable, yes.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on NEC, has the \u2013 I know initially, the Attorney General had talked about being opposed. Have they given an official opposition now with the commission, or where does that stand?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Steve, I don\u2019t think that the Attorney General has modified their original position as we come through.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And so there is no \u2013 at this point, there is no like settlement talks going on that\u2019s just going to be a decision?\nVince Sorgi: At this point, we are just awaiting the decision.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then just on another thing you had talked about was potentially \u2013 I think you have potentially trying to kind of resolve future rate case as part of this, too. But if you have to just get a decision, like when would be the next rate case in Rhode Island?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, we have agreed to not file a rate case for a period of 3 years from the time of our [Technical Difficulty]. And so that I think in Rhode Island at 9 months, 10 months to get from a tiny file to the time to complete. So depending on when it closes, that can give you kind of when or\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. So, that\u2019s \u2013 at least your proposal, that\u2019s a condition of your filing?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, that is a commitment that we made on \u2013 that is a commitment that has been made.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. And then \u2013 so maybe just to sum up on the dividend, so you have this new dividend level based on the existing businesses. You will \u2013 when you close NEC, you will reset some payout additional dividend related just to that business as well. And then beyond that, dividends would grow in line with earnings growth. Is that kind of the way to rebuild this up?\nVince Sorgi: That\u2019s exactly correct.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Last question, can you give any information on what Safari had in terms of earnings or EBITDA and any debt on Safari, if there is any separate debt in 2021?\nVince Sorgi: Yes.\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. So, it\u2019s included in our corporate and other segment, Steve, and we don\u2019t break it out from that as part of that, it\u2019s really not material to the overall PPL Corporation earnings, and it\u2019s just not a level of detail that we provide given its materiality.\nSteve Fleishman: Is there any debt on it, or is it just part of PPL corporate?\nJoe Bergstein: PPL corporate.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Alright. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning Ryan.\nRyan Levine: I was hoping that you could elaborate on what factors drove where PPL wants to be in terms of dividend payout ratio relative to the range that you highlighted in your slide deck. And any color as to how you are thinking about that for subsequent dividend decision?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, I will let Joe cover the details, but just high level, right. We wanted to make sure, again, this is a broader strategic repositioning, obviously starting with \u2013 acquisition of Veeco. The dividend reset was a natural part of that. So, making sure that again, we have one of the strongest balance sheets. We want to make sure that the dividend is sized appropriately for the new businesses going forward and make sure that we are set up to be able to grow that dividend in line with earnings going forward. And we think we have positioned ourselves very well to accomplish all of that with where we set it. But Joe, if there\u2019s any, you probably want to\u2026\nJoe Bergstein: Ryan, we have said for a while that we would set the dividend at 60% to 65% of earnings. And with the dividend announcement today, we are in that range on the base business as we move forward and include Narragansett in the forecast and provide the update, we would expect to continue to have dividend in the 60% to 65% payout range.\nRyan Levine: Thank you. And then you highlighted some of the kind of preview to the Analyst Day of starting with pro forma 2022 EPS and growing it off there. Is it going to be a 5-year growth that you are looking to provide? And any other color you could share around level of detail that we should expect to get updated at the future Analyst Day?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, it will be a comprehensive update, Ryan. We haven\u2019t provided a lot of information since the sale of WPD. We have recognized that. We have repositioned the company significantly and we are going to \u2013 we will provide a lot of detail on the new PPL including the growth rate and the duration of the growth rate. So, we will hold all of that for now until we get there, but you should expect a detailed update at that time.\nRyan Levine: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead.\nGreg Orrill: Yes. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning.\nGreg Orrill: Good morning. Regarding the dividend, assuming Narragansett Electric closes, when would you provide that new level? Would that be in the closing or at the Analyst Day or how would that work?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, we would provide an update on that at the Investor Day based on the current schedule, which would support a March closing, as we have been saying. We would then target to have the Investor Day within a few weeks of closing. And so that potentially could put the second quarter dividend in play for the advances.\nGreg Orrill: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning Vince. \nVince Sorgi: Good morning.\nAnthony Crowdell: Thanks for taking my question. Just hopefully two quick ones, just not specific to Narragansett, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about the approval process there, but just it\u2019s my first transaction in Rhode Island. What\u2019s the process if the merger gets declined? Is there a re-filing process where it can \u2013 can a company appeal to a higher court?\nVince Sorgi: So there is an appeal process, Anthony. Certainly, we are focused on getting the approval done. It really depends on what would be in the order. So, it\u2019s really hard to predict what our next steps would be, could potentially be DOE filing. And then we also have the option to appeal, but really speculating at this point. We are hopeful that we have met. Again, we think we have met the standard for approval and we are hopeful that, that decision will come out in our favor when it comes out.\nAnthony Crowdell: Do you know what court the appeal takes place in or is it with the same regulator?\nVince Sorgi: I\u2019m not sure about that, Anthony.\nAnthony Crowdell: Okay. And then if I could just pivot probably off of Michael\u2019s question earlier on Kentucky, just how should we think about the growth the growth in Kentucky from this level? And just if you could maybe give some clarity on that?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, we are not providing really growth targets for any parts of the business at this point, but we will provide full updates on all of that on the Investor Day. To Joe\u2019s point, we recognize that we have been in this kind of point between selling WPD and closing Eco without providing a lot of financial detail and we commit to doing that on Investor Day, but we are not ready to do that.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my question, Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Anthony.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We certainly look forward to introducing the new PPL to investors. We remain very confident as we have talked a little bit today that our strategic repositioning will deliver long-term value for our shareowners. We do see robust capital investment opportunities going forward to deliver clean energy future. That investment will fuel competitive earnings and dividend growth going forward and we believe we can deliver that clean energy future in a way that\u2019s affordable to our customers with no equity needs in the foreseeable future given the strength of our balance sheet. So again, we are \u2013 we look forward to seeing you all at the Investor Day and providing all the details that I know you are looking forward for the new PPL. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our 2021 year end earnings call. Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call, I will begin this morning with an overview of 2021 and what was clearly a significant transition year for PPL. I will highlight key achievements we made throughout the year, including our progress in strategically repositioning PPL for future growth and success. Joe will provide a financial update including the previously discussed reset of our first quarter dividend we announced this morning and a detailed overview of our 2021 financial results. And as always, we will leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4, I am incredibly proud of how our team performed in what was truly a remarkable year for PPL. As we began a new century in our company's history, we took bold steps to strategically reposition PPL as a U.S. focused energy company, committed to sustainable growth and well-positioned to lead the clean energy transition, while maintaining affordability and reliability for our customers. We completed the sale of our UK utility business in June, achieving exceptional value at almost $11 billion while eliminating risks associated with foreign operations. We then took steps to strengthen PPL's balance sheet by reducing $3.5 billion of our holding company debt, which provides us with significant financial flexibility going forward. We advanced our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric, which will expand and diversify our U.S. presence, add another high-quality regulated utility to our portfolio, and create additional opportunities to leverage our proven operating model to drive value for customers and shareowners. We anticipate receiving a final order from the Rhode Island division of public utilities and carriers with respect to the acquisition by March of 2022. While the strategic repositioning was a key priority in 2021 to set PPL up for long-term success, we also remained focused on achieving our near-term objectives. In 2021, we continued our track record of earning equity returns that were in line with those allowed by our regulators. We also achieved constructive regulatory outcomes in 2021, with the settlements on the Pennsylvania FERC ROE challenge and the rate case in Kentucky, which will provide added stability and predictability to our plan over the next several years. We also returned over $2 billion to shareowners through dividends as well as share repurchases, which included the completion of our targeted $1 billion in share buybacks through December 31. And true to our mission, we delivered energy safely, reliably and affordably for our 2.5 million customers in the United States. And as the pandemic refused to yield, we stayed resilient, acted responsibly to protect our employees and remained focused on continuous improvement. From Kentucky to Pennsylvania, we delivered exceptional service throughout 2021. We maintained transmission and distribution reliability as well as generation availability that was among the best in the industry. Despite PPL Electric Utilities experiencing significant storms during 2021, it maintained top quartile performance for Seifi, which measures the average number of outages our customers experience. Meanwhile, our Kentucky operations posted their second best year on record for safety. When severe weather struck either in Pennsylvania or Kentucky, we responded quickly and effectively. For example, after December tornadoes, tour through portions of our service territory in Kentucky, damaging or destroying more than 500 transmission and distribution poles, we restored power to most customers within 48 hours. Similarly, when the remnants of Hurricane Ida swept through our Pennsylvania service territory, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers, we mobilized quickly and effectively to get the lights back on as soon as possible. Our restoration performance in the wake of Hurricane Ida was recognized with an EEI Emergency Response Award. This performance is the result of the investments we have made in our grid and our dedicated employees who pride themselves on delivering the superior level of service each day. And that service was once again reflected in our customer satisfaction scores. We were honored to receive 4 new J.D. Power awards in 2021 for electric utility residential and business customer satisfaction, with PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities both ranking highest among similarly sized utilities in their respective regions. And following an independent survey of customers at 140 of the largest utilities in the U.S., PPL Electric and Kentucky Utilities were recognized by Escalent as two of the most trusted utility brands in the nation. Across PPL, we also continue to foster a culture of innovation, investing in advanced technology and data analytics to deliver industry leading reliability and enterprise-wide cost efficiencies. This resulted in multiple industry awards in 2021, including the use of dynamic line rating, technology and the use of data analytics to better target vegetation management. With an eye towards keeping reliability strong and empowering our customers, we also continue to invest in the future. This included executing more than $2 billion in infrastructure improvements to further strengthen grid resilience, modernize our network, incorporate advanced technology and pave the way for increased electrification and renewable energy in our service territories. Turning to Slide 5, over the past year, we also delivered on our commitments to deliver a sustainable PPL for our shareowners, employees and the communities we serve. We made significant progress in advancing our clean energy strategy. We adopted a net zero carbon emissions goal, accelerated our interim emissions reduction targets to 70% from 2010 levels by 2035, and 80% by 2040. And we also accelerated our coal plant retirement schedule. Separately, we announced a commitment of over $50 million in new investments to fund research and development in the clean energy space with our planned investments in EIP and EPRI's low carbon resources initiative. We also launched a new partnership to study carbon capture at natural gas combined cycle power plants and reached new agreements to provide an additional 125 megawatts of solar power to major Kentucky customers. In November, we published our latest Comprehensive Climate Assessment report, which highlights the risks associated with climate change and the opportunities in responding to it and evaluate potential of future emissions under multiple scenarios. This included a scenario consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our climate assessment outlines our clean energy strategy and goals to enable a responsible transition that balances our commitments to the environment, our customers, our employees and our communities. LG and KU also submitted their Triannual Joint Integrated Resource Plan, which reflected a significant increase in projected renewable additions in the 15-year planning horizon compared to our prior plan. We expect the trend of a more rapid decarbonization of our generation fleet in Kentucky to continue with further improvements in cost and technology for renewables as well as other clean energy technologies. In addition to our focus on advancing our clean energy transition, we also remained very engaged in the communities we serve and with our employees throughout 2021. We continue to move PPL forward by creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We implemented an enterprise-wide diversity, equity and inclusion strategy, adopted DEI commitments, increased diversity within our leadership rank, overall workforce and the board and we expanded our support for social justice and equity initiatives in the communities we serve. In addition, we continue to create new opportunities through business resource groups for employees of all backgrounds and experiences to collaborate, share perspectives and contribute to PPL's success. Our strong commitment to diverse and inclusion received recognition for multiple organizations in 2021, with PPL being named the Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality and Disability Inclusion as well as a top company for ESG. In this January, PPL once again was named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality, marking the sixth straight year PPL has received this recognition. During our fall giving campaigns, PPL employees and retirees collectively raised more money than ever before, more than $7 million in individual pledges and corporate matching contributions that will help lift individuals, families and communities. And in the aftermath of the Kentucky tornadoes, we responded quickly providing financial support to assist Kentucky families and businesses. In other highlights, we continued to build an exceptional management team that we believe will lead PPL to its best years to come. We promoted Greg Dudkin to Chief Operating Officer and are leveraging his experience in building one of the most advanced utilities in the nation in PPL Electric Utilities to drive further value for stakeholders across all of PPL's operating companies. We are extremely excited to have Wendy Stark on our team as our new General Counsel. Wendy's extensive experience in regulatory matters and her deep knowledge of our industry have made her a great addition to PPL. We named two new utility presidents in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with Stephanie Raymond in Pennsylvania and John Crockett in Kentucky. Stephanie is the first female utility president in our company's 100-year history. We also named a highly qualified and experienced leadership team in Rhode Island led by Dave Bonenberger from PPL and numerous talented employees from National Grid to lead our electric and gas operations pending the completion of the acquisition. We also took steps to strengthen our corporate governance during the year. Our Board of Directors appointed an outstanding leader and experienced board member as Independent Board Chair in Craig Rogerson, reflecting PPL's continued commitment to strong corporate governance and independent oversight by a diverse, engaged board. And Heather Redman, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners was a welcomed addition to our highly experienced Board of Directors and brings a wealth of expertise in disruptive technologies and the energy industry. In summary, across our business, we made tremendous progress in 2021 as we pursued our strategy to deliver sustainable value for all stakeholders and position PPL for future growth and success. With that, I will now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe? Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, 2021 was very much a transition year for PPL. It was about reimagining PPL and laying a firm foundation for the company's future growth and success, and I believe we achieved just that. Looking forward, our focus is on completing the acquisition of Narragansett Electric and introducing a new PPL to shareowners, a PPL that is committed to delivering sustainable value for share owners, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in the U.S. utility sector, distinguished by its best-in-class customer service. Committed to net-zero carbon emissions and well positioned to lead the clean energy transition, while maintaining affordable, reliable service for our customers. We look forward to sharing further details on our strategy and the exciting growth prospects for the new PPL at our Investor Day. Good morning, Shar. Yes, sure. First of all, let me just say that we think we've met the standard for approval in the state, and we are looking forward to the decision coming out from the division. And Again, as we stated really from the outset of this process, we believe that PPL is uniquely positioned to serve lot customers at this point in time. When you look at our long history of providing energy safely, reliably, affordably for our customers, we consistently rank among the very best for customer satisfaction. We've been a clear leader in developing and deploying the kind of smart grid technology that's going to be critical to helping Rhode Island meet their very ambitious decarbonization goals. And with the additional commitments that we've made, we believe the transaction is clearly in the public interest in Rhode Island. So I'll just reiterate that we believe we've met the standard, and we're looking forward to the decision. Yes, Shar. I would say we don't have a detailed update on that. We will provide a full update at the Investor Day. Really it's important that we get through the regulatory process in Rhode Island, of course, we've made some commitments as part of the process to mainly to make sure we factor all of that into the proteins discussion, and we will update with the full update on the Investor Day call. Well, Shar, as you know, we are not going to comment on market rumors, so... Good morning. Yes, sure, Paul. While it's certainly possible that we will receive the decision as early as next week from the division, we're not certain in that, and we are still in the middle of the regulatory approval process. And as we discussed on the third quarter call, we did want to reduce the uncertainty related to the anticipated reset of the dividend following the UK sale. And just without the firm time line for the Rhode Island transaction, we just felt it was appropriate to keep our normal cadence, which as you know, we would normally announce our first quarter dividend on our call, on our year end call. And so as we were contemplating whether to move from that normal cadence and potentially hold off the call. We also realized that if we didn't do it today, we actually risk ended up doing it in 8K, which would not be the preferred approach, of course. So we wanted to make sure that we could provide an opportunity for questions around what we've said. And that was really the nature of the decision to announce it today versus leading. And then in terms of the second part of your question, as Joe noted, the Q1 dividend is based on our current operations only, and we would plan to increase that following the closing of the Narragansett transaction. And again, we will provide that full update once we close the deal and then conduct the Analyst Day for the investor call. Joe, you want to... Thanks, Paul Yes, that's the plan, Durgesh. Sure. Yes, we can. Yes, Paul, I don't really want to talk about some hypotheticals. We are really focused. Again, I will just go back to what I said to Shar, we think we have clearly met the standard for approval in the state with what we bring to the table in terms of our operating experience, the financial strength of our company, of course, commitments that we have made throughout the process there. So, we and National Grid are very focused on getting to closing. We spent the last year on transition planning, integration planning, hiring or getting 1,100 people like NFI and ready to start on day one. We are all very focused on getting this deal over the goal line and bringing real value to our line. Yes. Look, Paul, I think based on the schedule that we have, right, the targeted decision date is the 25th. But we just \u2013 we recognize that there is a lot in this case through the written testimony Greece, the oral hearings. We just want to recognize the fact that the 25th is a target. And there is a lot that the hearing officer and the division need to get through. And so there has been no change in the 25th as the target. But we are just trying to be realistic that there is no guarantee that we are going to get. Sure. So, we have the next round of retirements, you may recall, in 2024. Based on our reserve margins, we don't anticipate a significant need to replace generation for those retirements. The next group would be in 2028. We would need to replace the 2028 retirements. And so probably see capital start to be spent in the 2026-ish timeframe for that. And then the next round of retirements are this side of 2035. So, I think in 2034, \u201835-ish. And so you will see the capital in the early \u201830s to prepare for those. Yes. So, it's a good question. So, as you know, we are incredibly focused on decarbonizing the overall generation fleet. But we you bring up a good point around the cost of natural gas versus the cost of coal. So, as we think about it, Michael, we will continue to look at how we best utilize the fleet to ensure reliability for the lowest cost for customers, but at the same time, decarbonizing, so that could be additional renewables \u2013 renewable PPAs or on renewals. We are always looking at \u2013 does it make sense to shift between natural gas and coal or so. And those are all things that we continue to iterate as we look at the decarbonization \u2013 the overall decarbonization strategy for the quality. Yes. So, we have done two rounds of smart meter deployment in Pennsylvania. We are doing our initial deployment in Kentucky. We are expecting that to be completed in 2026. And then you haven't asked, but in Rhode Island, they don't have smart meters, but that would be something we would be deploying very quickly after acquisition in as well. Sure. Yes. Sorry, if I wasn't clear on that with your earlier response. Yes, we think it would be 2022's pro forma. That's reasonable, yes. Yes. Steve, I don't think that the Attorney General has modified their original position as we come through. At this point, we are just awaiting the decision. Yes. So, we have agreed to not file a rate case for a period of 3 years from the time of our [Technical Difficulty]. And so that I think in Rhode Island at 9 months, 10 months to get from a tiny file to the time to complete. So depending on when it closes, that can give you kind of when or... Yes. So, that is a commitment that we made on \u2013 that is a commitment that has been made. That's exactly correct. Yes. Thanks, Steve. Good morning Ryan. Yes, I will let Joe cover the details, but just high level, right. We wanted to make sure, again, this is a broader strategic repositioning, obviously starting with \u2013 acquisition of Veeco. The dividend reset was a natural part of that. So, making sure that again, we have one of the strongest balance sheets. We want to make sure that the dividend is sized appropriately for the new businesses going forward and make sure that we are set up to be able to grow that dividend in line with earnings going forward. And we think we have positioned ourselves very well to accomplish all of that with where we set it. But Joe, if there's any, you probably want to... Good morning. Yes. So, we would provide an update on that at the Investor Day based on the current schedule, which would support a March closing, as we have been saying. We would then target to have the Investor Day within a few weeks of closing. And so that potentially could put the second quarter dividend in play for the advances. Good morning. So there is an appeal process, Anthony. Certainly, we are focused on getting the approval done. It really depends on what would be in the order. So, it's really hard to predict what our next steps would be, could potentially be DOE filing. And then we also have the option to appeal, but really speculating at this point. We are hopeful that we have met. Again, we think we have met the standard for approval and we are hopeful that, that decision will come out in our favor when it comes out. I'm not sure about that, Anthony. Yes, we are not providing really growth targets for any parts of the business at this point, but we will provide full updates on all of that on the Investor Day. To Joe's point, we recognize that we have been in this kind of point between selling WPD and closing Eco without providing a lot of financial detail and we commit to doing that on Investor Day, but we are not ready to do that. Thanks, Anthony. Thanks. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. We certainly look forward to introducing the new PPL to investors. We remain very confident as we have talked a little bit today that our strategic repositioning will deliver long-term value for our shareowners. We do see robust capital investment opportunities going forward to deliver clean energy future. That investment will fuel competitive earnings and dividend growth going forward and we believe we can deliver that clean energy future in a way that's affordable to our customers with no equity needs in the foreseeable future given the strength of our balance sheet. So again, we are \u2013 we look forward to seeing you all at the Investor Day and providing all the details that I know you are looking forward for the new PPL. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 7 for the financial update. Today, we announced fourth quarter reported earnings of $0.18 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.04 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric and discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business. Adjusting for special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.22 per share. Our fourth quarter results bring our total 2021 results to a net loss of $1.93 per share. Special items for 2021 were $2.98 per share, primarily due to discontinued operations associated with the UK utility business, a UK tax rate change prior to the sale and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt. Adjusting for special items, 2021 earnings from ongoing operations were $1.05 per share. Before turning to the 2021 earnings walk, I will highlight a few other financial updates. The most notable being the first quarter dividend we announced this morning. As we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, we plan to update the dividend following the January 3 payment as we continued to progress on PPL's strategic repositioning. Recall that we had maintained the dividend at the prior rate despite the sale of WPD, providing $350 million of dividends to reward long-term shareowners as we work to close the transactions and deploy the cash proceeds from the WPD sale in a value-accretive manner. Today, we have announced the first quarter 2022 dividend of $0.20 per share payable April 1. The updated quarterly dividend aligns with our earnings projections for PPL's current businesses and a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 65%. We plan to provide an updated annualized dividend rate and growth projections to align with earnings growth during an Investor Day following the completion of the Narragansett regulatory review process. We recognize that it would have been optimal to declare the April 1 dividend when we provide our annualized earnings forecast. However, since we haven't completed the Narragansett regulatory review process, we wanted to be transparent today by providing clarity on the dividend reset following the sale of WPD. We plan to reflect any increase in the dividend due to the inclusion of Narragansett in our forecast when we provide a comprehensive financial update at the Investor Day. As Vince noted, one of the key financial highlights for 2021 was a reduction in our holding company debt as we allocated a significant amount of the WPD sales proceeds to strengthen PPL's balance sheet. We had a unique opportunity to establish one of the leading credit profiles in the sector, an attribute we see is increasingly important with the growing capital needs to fund the clean energy transition and now amid the backdrop of rising interest rates. In other financial updates, we amended and extended our credit facilities during the fourth quarter to better align our liquidity needs post the strategic repositioning. In short, we slightly reduced the capacity at PPL Capital funding to $1.25 billion from $1.45 billion as we no longer need the same level of liquidity without the foreign currency risk associated with the UK. We have also included an option to add an Narragansett as a co-borrower to the PPL Capital funding credit facility, pending the closing of the acquisition. And we continue to target 16% to 18% CFO and FFO to debt metrics, including the Narragansett Electric acquisition. We believe these actions provide a very strong financial foundation and place PPL among the best credit profiles in our industry. Let's move to our full year 2021 earnings results on Slide 8. I would note that while I will compare 2021 earnings to our 2020 results, the periods are not truly comparable given the sale of the UK businesses, the reallocation of certain costs, the balance sheet recapitalization along with the outcome of the transmission ROE challenge. Similar to prior quarters, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate other amount to reflect certain costs previously allocated to the UK regulated segment, primarily interest expense and other support costs. These costs totaled about $0.07 per share for the year. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.61 per share, a $0.04 year-over-year decrease. Earnings results in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by a reduction in the transmission formula rate return on equity, lower peak transmission demand and higher operation and maintenance expense. These decreases were partially offset by returns on additional capital investments in transmission. Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.61 per share in 2021. A $0.06 increase over comparable results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, and lower interest expense primarily due to lower interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment and lower interest rates, partially offsetting these items were higher operation and maintenance expense, related to several factors, including support costs, generation plant costs, T&D costs and higher depreciation due to the additions to PP&E. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other, primarily included lower interest expense primarily due to less outstanding long-term holding company debt, partially offset by interest costs previously allocated to the Kentucky segment, partially offsetting this increase were several factors that were not individually significant. Moving to Slide 9. The capital investments made in Pennsylvania and Kentucky during 2021, support grid modernization, grid resiliency and reliability and improved service for our customers. Of the $2 billion of CapEx that Vince noted, we invested about $1 billion in each of the segments. In Pennsylvania, investments in distribution were made to maintain top quartile industry reliability and performance and investments in more advanced IT systems. Meanwhile, on the transmission side, investments were primarily related to asset health and reliability with a focus on smart relays, equipment monitoring and automation to support a more advanced grid. Our Kentucky investments were primarily related to replacing aging transmission infrastructure, maintaining and enhancing our electric distribution network, generation outages, environmental compliance and grid modernization. This resulted in total rate base growth of nearly 6% even as rate base related to our coal-fired generation facilities declined. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince for some closing comments. Yes. No. I think the costs associated with the strategic repositioning were normal and interrelated to the Narragansett acquisition, really, the amount that's associated with Kentucky is really immaterial. Nothing related to any strategic colonic Kentucky. It's all essentially for the Narragansett acquisition. Thanks, you too. Well, we will get into the total use of proceeds and any \u2013 and how that's utilized when we get to the Investor Day. Yes. So, it's included in our corporate and other segment, Steve, and we don't break it out from that as part of that, it's really not material to the overall PPL Corporation earnings, and it's just not a level of detail that we provide given its materiality. PPL corporate. Ryan, we have said for a while that we would set the dividend at 60% to 65% of earnings. And with the dividend announcement today, we are in that range on the base business as we move forward and include Narragansett in the forecast and provide the update, we would expect to continue to have dividend in the 60% to 65% payout range. Yes, it will be a comprehensive update, Ryan. We haven't provided a lot of information since the sale of WPD. We have recognized that. We have repositioned the company significantly and we are going to \u2013 we will provide a lot of detail on the new PPL including the growth rate and the duration of the growth rate. So, we will hold all of that for now until we get there, but you should expect a detailed update at that time."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the PPL Corporation Third Quarter Earnings Conference. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Should [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter 2021 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation in our earnings release issued this morning on the Investor section of our website. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation and earnings release, which we'll discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results and other future events.  Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. Participating on our call this morning are Vincent Sorgi, PPL President and CEO, Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer, and Greg Dudkin, Chief Operating Officer. With that, I will now turn the call over to Vincent.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Andy. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our Third Quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 in the agenda for today's call, I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress we continue to make in advancing our strategic repositioning. I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL 's Clean Energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update. Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of Third Quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  Turning to slide 4, We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. With FERC' s approval, we now have 4 of the 5 approvals necessary to close on the transaction. We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. In its procedural schedule, the division has established February 25th as the target date for a decision.  This would put PPL and National Grid on a path to close on the transaction by March of next year, as originally expected. We've included a slide with the divisions procedural schedule in the appendix of today's presentation. As we pursue the final regulatory approval, we continue working closely with National Grid on planning to ensure a smooth transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. Together, we've collaborated through 30 functional integration teams to plan and execute a safe, effective, and minimally disruptive transition of the Rhode Island operations.  These teams have built robust day 1 integration plans to execute on identified business requirements, drafted transition service agreements that will be key to providing a stable, seamless transition for customers, redesigned critical business processes to enable the TSAs to effectively operate, designed a new Rhode Island operating model and organization from the ground up, with over 1,100 National Grid employees accepting employment offers pending the close of the transaction. We have initiated an integrated change management and communication strategy to engage our future employees, customers, and Rhode Island stakeholders to begin to build relationships for the long-term; and all 3 labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership.  As we work to secure final approval, we look forward to partnering with the talented team in Rhode Island to deliver safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. And we're very excited about the opportunity the acquisition presents to build one of the nation's most advanced clean energy enabling grids in support of Rhode Island's ambitious decarbonization goals. Finally, on this slide, I'm excited to highlight a new, valuable addition to PPL's Board of Directors, Heather Redman. Heather is the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage artificial intelligence, machine learning startups, including energy-related applications.  She brings expertise in disruptive technologies, industry transformation, energy development and energy technology at a time when PPL is squarely focused on driving innovation and positioning our Company for growth in the clean energy transition. I am confident that Heather will be a fantastic addition to our diverse and experienced Board. With Heather's addition, our board now has ten directors, 60% of whom are diverse, and 30% of whom are women. Turning to Slide 5 in advancing our strategic repositioning, we also continue to make progress in deploying proceeds from the sale of our U.K. assets to maximize share owner value.  And while we recognize cash is fungible, we are showing the major buckets for the use of proceeds on this slide, and today, we've announced 2 updates. First, as we continue to develop our business plans, we've identified at least a billion dollars in incremental capital investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky through 2025 to support grid resilience in modernization and advance a sustainable energy future for our customers. The identified CapEx opportunities predominantly in the T&D areas include continued application of smart grid technologies, which improved overall system reliability and reduce O&M cost at the same time.  It also includes further hardening of the system to support reliability and resilience in the face of more frequent and stronger storms. We'll look to make the same types of investments in Rhode Island once we closed the transaction and work with Rhode Island stakeholders on the pace of change to the Clean Energy economy in the state, keeping in mind the cost impacts for customers. In addition to our updates on CapEx opportunities, we've also revised our expectations for share repurchases and have allocated an additional $500 million to buy backs. We now expect to repurchase a total of approximately $1 billion dollars of PPL common stock by year-end, effectively doubling the amount previously announced on our Q2 call. We've already completed $550 million in share repurchases through October 31st. We're pleased about the progress we've made in evaluating our capital plans and look forward to sharing additional details at an Analyst Day following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition.  In the meantime, we'll continue to review our business plans for additional opportunities that will drive value for both customers and shareowners. We're also providing an update on the timing of an expected change to PPL 's dividend and reiterate the planned dividend policy following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. The dividend has and will remain an important part of PPL 's total shareowner return proposition. Given the procedural schedule in place for the required regulatory approval in Rhode Island, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate through the January, 2022 payment.  After that date, we plan to realign the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 60 to 65% of the repositioned PPL earnings as previously communicated. The final decision regarding the dividend will be made by the Board of Directors after the Narragansett closing. Moving to Slide 6, We continue to advance our clean energy strategy as we pursue our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In October, our Kentucky utilities filed renewable power purchase agreements with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to provide a combined 125 megawatts of solar power to 5 major customers.  Under the 20-year agreements, which will support customer participation in LGNE & KU's Green Tariff, LGNE & KU will procure 100% of the power from a new solar facility that will be built in Western Kentucky. The agreements reflect our continued efforts to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in the state. In another notable third quarter development, we announced in September that we've joined in expanding coalition of U.S. utilities committed to supporting the growth of electric vehicles as we seek additional opportunities to enable third party decarbonization. The Electric Highway Coalition will focus on development of a seamless network of rapid electric vehicle charging stations connecting major highway systems from the northeast to the midwest, down to Texas.  The goal is to create convenient options for long distance EV travel to reduce range anxiety for consumers. We also continue to expand investments in R&D needed to achieve net-zero. Our Kentucky Utilities recently announced a partnership to study the capture of carbon-dioxide emissions. The partnership with the University of Kentucky 's Center for Applied Energy Research or CAER will seek to develop cost-effective, scalable technology to capture carbon-dioxide from a natural gas-combined cycle plant.  We'll be working with CAER in using the carbon capture infrastructure we've already built at our brown coal facility in 2014 to simulate emissions from a natural gas plant. The project will also support a study aimed at direct air capture of CO2, potentially creating a negative emissions power plant. In addition to capturing CO2, the system aims to produce two value-added streams, hydrogen and oxygen, that can be sold to offset the cost of capturing and storing the CO2. Additional partners in this R&D initiative include Vanderbilt University and EPRI and GTI through their low carbon resources initiative.  The carbon capture unit we've built at the Brown plant is one of only a few carbon capture systems in operation today at Power Plants in the United States. Furthering our R&D related efforts, PPL recently acquired an ownership interest in the SOO Green project, a 350-mile underground transmission project that seeks to connect the MISO, and PJM power markets, and support growing demand for clean energy. We recognized that expanding the nation's transmission grid will be critical to connecting more wind and solar power and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Breaking through citing, permitting, and other barriers to build this transmission quickly and cost-effectively will be key. SOO Green seeks to tackle these challenges by developing high-voltage transmission lines underground along major rail corridors.  PPL's investment in the SOO Green project will enable us to gain valuable insight into this innovative approach. We look forward to lending our capabilities and transmission expertise to support this project success. Turning to Slide 7. On October 19th, LGNE & KU submitted their triennial joint integrated resource plan to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides the commission with information regarding our potential generation sources over the next 15 years, to meet forecasted energy demand in a lease cost manner.  The IRP is submitted for informational purposes. It represents a moment in time look at ongoing resource planning using current business assumptions and long-term forecast. LGNE & KU 's 2021 IRP projects, a significant reduction in coal's contribution to our generation mix declining from over 80% of the expected electricity produced in 2021, to about half of the total power produced in 2036. In our base case scenario for load and fuel prices, we show the retirement of nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal capacity as we economically advance to Clean Energy transition.  These projected retirements are consistent with the depreciation study filed in our last [Indiscernible], as well as the estimates used in developing our net zero goal announced last quarter. The IRP -based demand and base fuel price scenario envisions solar power playing a growing role in meeting our customers demand for energy. Over the next 15 years, accounting for nearly 20% of all the power we supply to our Kentucky customers by 2036. This scenario shows an additional 2,100 megawatts of solar combined with 200 megawatts of battery storage along with simple cycle gas units needed for reliability purposes, by the end of the planning period to replace those 2,000 megawatts of expected coal plant retirements. We've also added a high case scenario to this slide which reflects the implications of higher demand and higher fuel prices due to several factors.  Under the high case scenario, we would expect there to be significantly more energy needed by 2036, requiring additional capacity. Based on our assumptions, that would primarily be met with an additional 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewable and storage resources above the base case scenario through that time period. Further, that would result in more than twice as much output from renewable resources by 2036, reflecting approximately 40% of generation output, primarily replacing natural gas from the base - case scenario. We've provided a slide and the appendix of today's presentation that outlines the differences in the assumptions for the base and high-k scenarios.  We expect the next IRP, which will be filed in 2024, to be an extremely important plan based on the current timing of our next coal plant retirements, which are expected to begin again in 2024. Moving to Slide 8. On August 20th, PPL Electric Utilities announced a constructive settlement with an alliance of industrial and municipal customers that have challenged the Company's FERC -approved base transmission return on equity.  The settlement, which must be approved by FERC, would change PPL Electric's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% from May 2020 to May 2022 with a rate stepping up to 10% by June 2023. The settlement also updates the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of its actual equity component calculated in accordance with the formula rate template or 56%. The settlement also allows PPL Electric to modify the current formula rate, which is based on a historic test year, and move the Company to a projected [Indiscernible] year. Further PPL's formula rate could also be modified to be based on the calendar year moving forward, rather than the current rate year that begins, June 1.  We expect these changes to help reduce regulatory lag as we continue to make additional investments in transmission infrastructure. Overall, the settlement is expected to reduce Net Income by approximately $25 million to $30 million per year. The details of the FERC transmission ROE settlement are included in the appendix of today's presentation. In other operational developments our utilities continue to be recognized for our award-winning customer service and innovation. PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities were once again listed as 2 of the most trusted utility brands in the United States based on a recent study performed by human behavior firm, Escalent.  The results of the study showed that communications played a vital role in building brand trust between utilities and our customers in 2020 during the pandemic. It was the third consecutive year PPL Electric received this recognition and the second consecutive year Kentucky Utilities. Also, The Association of Edison Illuminating Companies selected PPL Electric Utilities as a winner of one of their 2021 achievement awards for revolutionary work in vegetation management. Trees are a common cause of outages.  Within PPL Electric Utilities service territory, it's estimated that about a third of distribution outages over the past 5 years were caused by trees contacting overhead wires. By using a new approach that leverages data analytics and other new technologies, PPL Electric Utilities found ways to trim and remove the right trees at the right times across 28,000 miles of overhead lines to help prevent outages. This has led to improved reliability despite an increase in more severe weather without increasing overall vegetation management costs. Additionally, Public Utilities Fortnightly has named PPL Electric Utilities as a top innovator for 2021.  Thanks to its industry-leading use of dynamic line rating or DLR technology on its transmission line. By using smart sensors that collect real-time information like wind speed and line temperature, operators can relieve transmission congestion and increase the electricity sent over those lines. PPL Electric Utilities has been recognized for its leading-edge approach to integrating DLR into core operations and using data from the sensors to make [Indiscernible] investment decisions. And finally, we continue our efforts to support economic development in the regions we serve.  One recent major development in this area is for its announcement of plans to construct a $6 billion electric battery complex within our LGNE & KU service territory. It is one of, if not the largest economic development announcement in Kentucky 's history, and will have far reaching positive impacts on communities around the Commonwealth. In fact, 2021 has been a record year for Kentucky in terms of economic development growth with over $10 billion in new investments being announced within the state. Further recent developments in addition to Ford's announcement include a $460 million investment by Toyota and a $450 million investment by GE at its appliance park in Louisville. These decisions exemplify the strengths that Kentucky has to offer large industrial customers. Specifically, we are known for exceptional reliability to deliver energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Further, we have some of the lowest retail rates in the country, an important characteristic for large industrial customers and something we remain keenly focused on maintaining. Kentucky also has the third lowest business costs in the country and is home to 3 global shipping hubs. Our Kentucky service territories are located in a centralized region that is well protected from intensifying coastal storms and other natural disasters.  We are excited to support the energy needs of these developments, and their perspective impact on our surrounding communities. Before we move to the next slide in the broader context, I would also note that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and the States Office of Energy Policy unveiled a new energy strategy on October 20th called E3. The strategy considers 3 E's as key pillars to the strategic vision of a resilient economy in the state: Energy, the environment, and economic development. And this strategy aligns very well with PPL's Clean Energy transition strategy.  We're encouraged by several areas included in the strategy where our utilities will play a vital role and we expect will provide future opportunities. Including ensuring a transmission grid that supports growing renewable resources. Ensuring an electric distribution grid that is self-healing, self-sufficient and auto sensing. Supporting a diversified energy supply that is fuel-secure, sustainable, and resilient, incentivizing sustainable business investments including hydrogen and other renewable fuels.  Supporting the development of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration industries, and supporting alternative fuel transportation infrastructure. LG&E and KU participated in working groups associated with affordability and economic development in the lead up to the state announcing its strategy. We believe the strategic framework represents a comprehensive approach to positioning Kentucky for success in a changing energy landscape.  We look forward to engaging with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state further develops its strategy to support sustainability, boost competitiveness can spur job growth and innovation in local and regional economies. I will now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe.\nJoe Bergstein: Thanks, Vince. And good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. Today, we announce third quarter reported earnings of $0.27 per share. This reflects special items of $0.09 per share primarily related to losses on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the recapitalization of the Balance Sheet, post the sale of WPD. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.36 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Our third quarter results bring our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations to $0.83 per share.  Details on our year-to-date earnings are available in the appendix to today's presentation. Now let's move to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our third quarter segment results. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment recorded $0.16 per share for the third quarter, which was $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expense, primarily related to higher storm and support costs and a reserve recorded for a reduction to the return on equity in the transmission formula rate. Partially offsetting these items were returns on additional capital investments in transmission.  Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, third quarter results were $0.21 per share, up $0.04 per share increase compared to Q3 2020 results. The increase was primarily driven by higher base retail rates effective July 1 and lower interest expense, primarily due to interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. Partially offsetting this increase was higher operation and maintenance expense related to support and generation-related cost factors. They were not individually significant. Results at corporate and other were a loss of $0.01 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to less outstanding long-term holding Company debt. And that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In summary, as we work to complete our strategic repositioning, I remain incredibly excited about our future. We continue to build momentum throughout 2021 in executing our strategic objectives. And I'm confident we will emerge from our transformation, a leading U.S. energy Company, stronger, more agile, and better positioned to advance the Clean Energy transition to deliver utilities of the future and to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that operator, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will not begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. [Operators Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys.\nVincent Sorgi: Hey, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Just a couple of questions here. Vince, how should we think about the allocation of that $1 billion in new CapEx both geographic and shaping over time? And will you be able to guide on Rhode Island CapEx right out of the gate in February and March when the deal closes or there'll need to be a bit more time to get your plan in motion?\nVincent Sorgi: I'll have Greg talk about where we're seeing the $1 billion that we've identified today. And again, we continue to review the business plans. And so, as we put on the slide, we think that'll come in at about 1 to 2 billion as we finalized the plans. On the Rhode Island side, Shar, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head.  That's an area where I think we'll have a pretty good sense on what the opportunity is, in Rhode Island as we think about the Clean Energy transition on what we've done in Pennsylvania, bringing that grid to Rhode Island to support the renewable ambitions within the state. Of course, there's going to be offshore wind opportunities that we need to get rid -- ready for, as well as significant [Indiscernible] in the state. There's also a lot of transmission opportunity.  So there -- I think we'll have a pretty good sense of what needs to be done. The question will be, it will have to work with the state on how quickly they want to get to the new Clean Energy transition; especially keeping -- just keeping rates in check, which of course we do across all of our jurisdictions. So, I think it's probably a little premature to provide too much detail on that right now. But qualitatively, I would say, I think we'll have a pretty good sense of the opportunity when it happens, we'll need to engage with the state. But Greg, do you want to touch on the billion that we've already identified?\nGreg Dudkin: Sure, Vince. From a high level that billing is split between Pennsylvania and Kentucky and the focus is on grid modernization, automation, and resiliency, hardening projects, as well as projects to enable more DER and renewables on our grid. I would also add that we anticipate technology-related spend within this period of time. As far as the shaping, I would say, at a high level at this point we're still working through the client on that but it's probably going to be fairly level across the next 5 years.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly, the board has obviously allocated significant amount of the remaining WPD proceeds to buybacks and obviously you're talking about another $1 billion of CapEx from 2 utilities, you got incremental upside from Rhode Island. Could we just get a refresh on how you and the board are thinking through maybe the remaining unallocated portion between more CapEx, your buybacks in light of where the stock trades? And are organic moves still a possibility, Vince? What's the timing for how you and the board may allocate more? Thanks again.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, Shar. Did you say organic or inorganic moves?\nShar Pourreza: Well, I guess, inorganic.\nVincent Sorgi: Yeah. I just want to make sure I heard your question properly. So, I would say in general as we think about the capital allocation [Indiscernible] investing in the utilities is our priority and our bias, especially as we try to make sure that we're delivering [Indiscernible] that our customers need as we look at the transition to a Clean Energy future. So being able to fund that in a way that requires little to no equity issuances over the foreseeable future is incredibly important to us which is really how Joe and the team identify the $3.5 billion of debt that we bought down with part of the proceeds and getting the Balance Sheet in that position where we can fund not only this billion, but even incremental capital to your point with Rhode Island and other potential opportunities that we may identify without issuing equity.  So that's the first component of that. In terms of the stock buybacks themselves, again, we're looking at that versus other potential opportunities. And you mentioned inorganic. I talked about last quarter; we don't need M&A to hit the growth profile that we've communicated. Of course, we will be opportunistic as we always have been with M&A. But our -- I would say our focus in the M&A area right now, Shar, is to close Rhode Island, get the integration underway, and really ensure that we have a smooth transition there.  And then as we talked about before, working with the state on the pace of change for the Clean Energy transition up in Rhode Island and then making sure that we're supporting that with the capital and investment plans. So, our focus, I would say, on M&A right now is squarely on that. But as I always say, you never say never. If there's an opportunity that presents itself that we think would create incremental shareholder value above our organic growth plans, certainly it's something that we would consider as we've done in the past; but it's not the core of our strategy right now.\nShar Pourreza: That's perfect. I appreciate it. It seems like you guys are tightening up that gap between rate base and earnings. So, it's good. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo: Good morning.\nVincent Sorgi: Good morning.\nPaul Zimbardo: Thank you for the time, I have a two-part question, just to clarify Slide 5. Should we be adjusting utility CapEx category for effectively 50% equity content or it's a way that you built some Balance Sheet strength? And also, is it also effectively a toggle that for every incremental dollar of utility CapEx that reduces buyback capacity?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Joe, why don't you tell him about how we're thinking about that.\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah. So, Paul, clearly what we announced today was a billion dollars of total buybacks by year-end and at least a billion dollars of incremental capital investments. And we've identified some more potential beyond that, but we need to continue the analysis and work through the business plans. The range that you have, you see on that slide, are really just to provide some context to you on the remaining proceeds in those buckets.  And so, as we think about cash and the use of that cash, there's other considerations that we have think about, you know credit, timing of that spend, regulatory mechanisms, broader efficiencies across the largely domestic platform, and all of that will go into our full plan. So, I think once -- we'll be in a better position post the close of Narragansett to discuss the additional details and including how we deploy that remaining proceeds and what falls into each of those pockets.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. I understand. And then you've mentioned the incremental capitals, primarily transmission and distribution. Just wondering if you could frame the Kentucky generation opportunities through 2026 and 2031 from the priority base case you present.\nVincent Sorgi: [Indiscernible] so for -- through 2028, I would say, certainly through '24 which is our next projected coal plant retirement. We don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirements. So really the reserve margin starts to tighten when we start to get into the 2028 timeframe. And so, as you can see in the -- on Slide 18, which is the IRP megawatts that we're talking about under the base case and then the high case.  Over the 15-year period, which is really where again, it's post 28 when you see more significant retirements and then ultimate replacement for the increase in energy that we're projecting, both in the base case and then in the high case. We're thinking in the base case, there's probably around $3 billion up investment opportunity over that 15-year period.  Significantly more in the high case, obviously, you're seeing 5600 additional megawatts significantly more renewables in that case, and so the investment opportunity under high case would be -- call it around $10 billion plus or minus, so that's a significant opportunity. As we -- I should clarify, that like the Ford announcement, and some of the other announcements I talked about we're not necessarily in the base case.  They don't necessarily get us to the high case. As again, the high case has EV assumptions, and electric heat assumptions, very high gas prices over that sustained period. Obviously, all of that is still to be determined but I would say the positive thing with the Ford and the other announcements I talked about, at least on the major new customer additions were certainly trending towards the high case versus the base case.  So, the investment opportunity calls it $3 to $10 billion depending on the cases. Not a significant amount in the next 5 years. You might start to see some in 2026 as we plan for the 2028 retirees. But it's really, I would say, just following that time period is when you'll see more significant investment.\nPaul Zimbardo: Thank you. That's very helpful. Plus, the FERC comment. Looking forward to seeing you all virtually next week, hopefully in person next year. Thanks again.\nVincent Sorgi: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nVincent Sorgi: Hey, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, Vince. Good morning. I just had one question. All of the other stuff has been asked and you answered those. Just previously you've highlighted a potential perspective range of EPS growth trajectory, comparing PPL's forward-looking findings growth rate to peers. Obviously now, you've talked about the additional equity share buybacks, the CapEx plan is higher. Can you share your thoughts there on what my bet trajectory, the range that EPS growth might fall under?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. I would just reiterate, I think, what we've talked about in the past. We've said we expect to have a competitive EPS growth rate off of our '22 midpoint when we come out with that, and as you know, that range is anywhere from 4% to 8%. But I would say most of the ranges within that are even tighter in the 5% to 7% range, and so we would expect to be solidly in that range.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thanks. And just really one quick one. After this announcement of the $500 million in additional share buy back and the $1 billion in CapEx, we're left with roughly $1 billion in proceeds that still need to be deployed. Is that accurate?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, so we increased the share repurchases from $500 to a billion. And so, it's about 0.5 billion lefts, right?\nJoe Bergstein: Going with a billion dollars of capital, your kind of around a billion dollars [Indiscernible] numbers through cash. But we'll continue to evaluate [Indiscernible] use of those billion dollars and the [Indiscernible] more details when we -- after the close of Narragansett.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. Thanks Vince and Joe. Appreciate the time.\nJoe Bergstein: Sure.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Hey.\nVincent Sorgi: Way and combining that with underground high-voltage transmission. And so, for us, it's not about the size of the investment, it's for -- it's really a way for us to be part of an innovative project that hopefully could cut through some of those issues that we all know plague many transmission projects. And so, we're really trying to --\nPaul Patterson: I hear you on that. In fact, I'm similar familiar with the project and it does sound -- it sounds awesome, frankly, in terms of just what you talked about. It sounds great. There are 2 issues that I want to ask you about, in terms of the project. And that is there are these 2 complaints that they filed at FERC regarding, I think one is the PJM Interconnection. In other words, just what you said, the project sounds fascinating. It's merchant, it's underground, it's the right-of-way, it's everything you are talking about. What they seem to be complaining though about, is that PJM has this system impact study stuff that's delaying stuff, as you know. They're saying it could be up to three years. The other one is this capacity complaint that they've got, about the -- how they're going to be treated an external resource in the [Indiscernible] market. And so, my question I guess is, with respect to those 2, because I assume you guys have done due diligence even though it may not be that bigger of a project.  And so, you guys might have -- I would assume you guys have more insight than I do about what you think -- how you think those 2 complaints are going to unfold because it seems like they do have the potential to have a significant impact on the economics of the project or at least at the timing of the project. And I've been following this case. I mean they've had testimony go back and forth and what have you. And I just was wondering if you guys had any insight in terms of how you guys are viewing those complaints regarding those 2 issues: the system impact study, and I think it's facility study, 1, and 2. this external capacity treatment that they're seeking to get.\nVincent Sorgi: Greg, I don't know if there's anything specific regarding those issues that you're willing and able to talk to?\nGreg Dudkin: Really not too much to talk about. But I guess from a high level, Paul, for us to or for the United States to really get to being much greener and really reducing the carbon footprint, we're going to need a lot more transmission. So, I think these issues brought up on SOO Green project are probably going to be beyond just this project. Those are the types of issues that need to be resolved if we are to really expand the use of renewables and ultimately expand our transmission system.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Fair enough. I -- this sounds like an exciting project. I thought I'd be able to pick your brain a little bit. I appreciate the time, and congratulations on the ROE settlement. That seems like a pretty good deal you guys negotiated there in the Pennsylvania transmission ROE. That's it for me. Thanks so much.\nVincent Sorgi: Okay. Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nVincent Sorgi: Good morning.\nRyan Levine: What's the average price of the $500 million share buyback to-date that you're able to buy in those shares?\nVincent Sorgi: Under 29 bucks?\nRyan Levine: All right.\nJoe Bergstein: Yup.\nRyan Levine: And then as you're looking out at -- you mentioned that you're moving towards the high case in Kentucky. From what you're seeing, is there a way to kind of quantify the load upside from additional development within your service territory? And are you seeing any early indications of what post COVID load patterns are in your footprint that may inform some of those fees?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So on -- just in general on the load, I think what we're seeing [Indiscernible] PA we're seeing kind of C&I come back to pretty close to pre - COVID levels. They are a little bit short as you -- we have slides in the deck that show the load and that's really -- things that you're seeing across the country. So, retail and hospitality that those have not fully come back yet. We're seeing the same thing down in Kentucky on that with the commercial. Industrial in Kentucky of course, just a lot of the shutdown issues that we had during COVID, that's all recovered. But with the chip shortages and some of the supply chain issues, we're seeing some of the factories being turned back.  So that's why a little bit short on the C&I side. And then on the residential, we're just seeing in Pennsylvania a lot more workers are still working from home and what we're seeing in Kentucky. So, for the most part, Kentucky is back to pre - COVID. Again, it's a little bit positive, but in PA, we're still quite a bit positive. So, we'll -- we're still waiting to see how much of that remains permanent, Ryan, in terms of load, in terms -- with hybrid work schedules and just more flexibility that companies are providing their workforce.  So, I guess our expectation would be that residential stays slightly above, but that remains to be seen. And then in terms of the announcements that we talked about, probably a little premature to talk about the low, the exact load impacts on those and when they will cut, and when that will show up. We really in the case of Ford plant, the final designs need to be prepared and released. So, I think while certainly qualitatively this is positive for our jurisdiction in the state in general, and I think it will be it'll actually fuel, additional announcements and opportunities for folks that want to come into the state.  Again, we're on top of the E3 energy strategy that the governor announced, I think this all goes very well for economic development opportunities within Kentucky, which I think qualitatively is good for our jurisdictions in our service areas. But putting that into, say, a megawatt of load, I think it's a little premature for that. But as soon as we can do that, we will get that disclosure out.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color. And then last one for me, you mentioned some of the -- you highlighted some of the supply chain issues. They're impacting some of the manufacturers in your service territory. But in terms of kind of implementation of the acceleration of CapEx, are you seeing any limitations from supply chain that could kind of pace there or change the pace of implementation of your -- some of your spending?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. I'll let Greg talk about that.\nGreg Dudkin: Yeah, we're starting to see some extended lead times on some select material and equipment, but we've been able across our footprint, to extend the supplier base and mitigate that to some degree. But we're really not experiencing significant delays in current projects, and don't expect an impact on our increased capital plan, going forward.\nRyan Levine: Appreciate the color.\nVincent Sorgi: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: Hello. Good morning. Hey, thanks. So, couple of questions. First of all, you obviously did not win [Indiscernible] nor do I know if you even bid for it. So just in terms of your thinking on assets, could you maybe -- it's just a good -- the way to maybe talk about why that wasn't something that you were interested in.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, Steve, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific M&A opportunities in the market or even hypotheticals for that matter. So, I would just say, on the M&A front, we're focused on Rhode Island and getting that.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nVincent Sorgi: Not only to complete it but then, the transition to happen in very smooth way and then get off the TSAs and get fully under our ownership. So that's where our focus is.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Secondly, just going back to that Slide 5 and just to make sure I understand what you're showing here. The additional utility CapEx, that's an asset number, that's not an equity number. Only half of that would be equity roughly. I'm not sure you're actually using all $10.4 billion of cash proceeds when you had the stuff up then or am I -- how do I interpret? Because you're kind of mixing asset with equity?\nVincent Sorgi: I'll let Joe talk to that.\nJoe Bergstein: I understand the premise of your question, Steve and it's similar to Paul's question earlier. And -- but you need to -- I think you need to factor in the full transition of the Company and the Balance Sheet after the sale of WPD. So, you think about the use of proceeds, you need -- I think you need to consider the financial strength that provides the ability to execute a more robust business plan without any equity needs. A returning capital to share owners with the buyback. Of course, the acquisition of Narragansett.  But really at this point, we've not finalized our business plans. So, in the interim, we're trying to provide you some broad buckets of the opportunities that we have until we complete the acquisition of Narragansett and are able to provide you a full forecast. So, I get your question, but we need to get through the full process, and think about Rhode Island in the plan and the full options of opportunities and then we will be able to lay it out for you a little bit [Indiscernible] but we're trying to give you some incremental data here until we can get to that point.\nVincent Sorgi: But Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah.\nVincent Sorgi: I think to your point and just to solidify what Joe is saying, So, when we look at that $1 to $2 billion and this is kind of to your point, I think. We can fund that range without additional equity going forward, so.\nSteve Fleishman: Absolutely.\nVincent Sorgi: And that I think that's kind of to you --\nSteve Fleishman: Right.\nVincent Sorgi: That's kind of to your point. I think.\nSteve Fleishman: Kind of. I guess, another way to ask a quest -- that question is, I think you targeted your debt paydown, is this too pretty strong high tripled [Indiscernible] metrics for the amount of debt paydown. So, you've a lot of debt paydown. And then the investment of the additional equity or the additional proceeds, you got kind of feathers in over time. If you use '22 as a base, you're not really putting all this money to work.  And it makes it like almost a little bit of not really the base in a way. So, in theory, if you're growing the same as other utilities off that base, you should be growing just because you haven't put a lot of your money to work at or some trunk of your money back to work. I was just trying to think about if you're going to base the growth off '22, it just -- it's not really a new base.\nJoe Bergstein: But certainly, we're putting -- we'll put the money to work on the acquisition of Narragansett, the buybacks are [Indiscernible].\nSteve Fleishman: The buyback.\nJoe Bergstein: And the debt reductions complete. So, it's significantly behind us and so if you think about the opportunity, I don't know if it is different than any other utilities that has a forward capital plan that hasn't deployed the capital yet. So, I do think it is the base. We have transitioned and TSA and other costs that are in there that are a little different. But as far as utilizing the proceeds, I expect that the lion's share of those will be utilized by the time we get to the close of Narragansett, and provide a forecast and a base year and a growth rate.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nVincent Sorgi: Thanks [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Good afternoon, Vince. Good afternoon, Joe.\nJoe Bergstein: Afternoon.\nVincent Sorgi: How are you?\nAnthony Crowdell: Good, Vince. This maybe our year six [Indiscernible] I know it's early though. Just -- if I can follow up on Steve's question, and I apologize going back to Slide 5. If I just think about that slide and the additional CapEx you announce today, a billion dollars in the share buybacks total of billion dollars a year. What's left of the proceeds is $700 million. Am I thinking of that correctly?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. That's correct, yes.\nAnthony Crowdell: So then do you have the ability to do $2 billion of share buybacks if what's left is $700 million?\nJoe Bergstein: I think we do. But again, the intent of this page was to get broad buckets of how we're thinking about the opportunity with the proceeds. And so, I think these all kind of questions get back to the same point. I have to reiterate that we're not through with the business plan yet. So, we're trying to provide some level of detail to you in the interim as we think about this and we work through the plans, putting the -- Vince talked about this. Putting those proceeds, if you will, to the capital, we think is a better use of that capital ultimately to do the work that we need to do on the system and provide the network that customers need and do it in an affordable way. But we're not done and we just need to work through the full of the plan.\nAnthony Crowdell: Okay. But you're -- I'm not just thinking share buyback even like if you had an incremental utility CapEx up to $2 billion, another $1 billion, so you've got the $2 billion. If you hit that $2 billion, that would be greater than the proceeds, the 10 fours. Is that accurate?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. But again, the balance sheet is set up so that we can fund our CapEx growth without issuing equity. So, the balance sheet is strong enough to fund all that, Anthony.\nAnthony Crowdell: Got it. And then just -- last question. One of the earlier questions I [Indiscernible] talked about maybe the timing of the incremental CapEx and think it's split evenly between Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Just about total thinking about getting that CapEx into rates. I believe in Kentucky; you did have a [Indiscernible] for a couple of years. Just talk about how do you get that additional CapEx into rates.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So, the -- I think Greg said it was relatively evenly split across the years, not between PA and Kentucky. I think this initial billion we've identified is actually more weighted to Pennsylvania than it is Kentucky, [Indiscernible].\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question guys and looking forward to seeing [Indiscernible] EI.\nVincent Sorgi: Great. Thanks.\nJoe Bergstein: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Vince Sorgi for some closing remarks.\nVincent Sorgi: Great, just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call and we're looking forward to engaging with everybody next week at EI. So, thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thanks, Vince. And good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. Today, we announce third quarter reported earnings of $0.27 per share. This reflects special items of $0.09 per share primarily related to losses on the early extinguishment of debt associated with the recapitalization of the Balance Sheet, post the sale of WPD. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.36 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Our third quarter results bring our year-to-date earnings from ongoing operations to $0.83 per share.  Details on our year-to-date earnings are available in the appendix to today's presentation. Now let's move to Slide 10 for a more detailed look at our third quarter segment results. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment recorded $0.16 per share for the third quarter, which was $0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expense, primarily related to higher storm and support costs and a reserve recorded for a reduction to the return on equity in the transmission formula rate. Partially offsetting these items were returns on additional capital investments in transmission.  Turning to our Kentucky regulated segment, third quarter results were $0.21 per share, up $0.04 per share increase compared to Q3 2020 results. The increase was primarily driven by higher base retail rates effective July 1 and lower interest expense, primarily due to interest costs that were previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. Partially offsetting this increase was higher operation and maintenance expense related to support and generation-related cost factors. They were not individually significant. Results at corporate and other were a loss of $0.01 per share, which was $0.03 higher compared to a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to less outstanding long-term holding Company debt. And that concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yeah. So, Paul, clearly what we announced today was a billion dollars of total buybacks by year-end and at least a billion dollars of incremental capital investments. And we've identified some more potential beyond that, but we need to continue the analysis and work through the business plans. The range that you have, you see on that slide, are really just to provide some context to you on the remaining proceeds in those buckets.  And so, as we think about cash and the use of that cash, there's other considerations that we have think about, you know credit, timing of that spend, regulatory mechanisms, broader efficiencies across the largely domestic platform, and all of that will go into our full plan. So, I think once -- we'll be in a better position post the close of Narragansett to discuss the additional details and including how we deploy that remaining proceeds and what falls into each of those pockets. Going with a billion dollars of capital, your kind of around a billion dollars [Indiscernible] numbers through cash. But we'll continue to evaluate [Indiscernible] use of those billion dollars and the [Indiscernible] more details when we -- after the close of Narragansett. Sure. Yup. I understand the premise of your question, Steve and it's similar to Paul's question earlier. And -- but you need to -- I think you need to factor in the full transition of the Company and the Balance Sheet after the sale of WPD. So, you think about the use of proceeds, you need -- I think you need to consider the financial strength that provides the ability to execute a more robust business plan without any equity needs. A returning capital to share owners with the buyback. Of course, the acquisition of Narragansett.  But really at this point, we've not finalized our business plans. So, in the interim, we're trying to provide you some broad buckets of the opportunities that we have until we complete the acquisition of Narragansett and are able to provide you a full forecast. So, I get your question, but we need to get through the full process, and think about Rhode Island in the plan and the full options of opportunities and then we will be able to lay it out for you a little bit [Indiscernible] but we're trying to give you some incremental data here until we can get to that point. But certainly, we're putting -- we'll put the money to work on the acquisition of Narragansett, the buybacks are [Indiscernible]. And the debt reductions complete. So, it's significantly behind us and so if you think about the opportunity, I don't know if it is different than any other utilities that has a forward capital plan that hasn't deployed the capital yet. So, I do think it is the base. We have transitioned and TSA and other costs that are in there that are a little different. But as far as utilizing the proceeds, I expect that the lion's share of those will be utilized by the time we get to the close of Narragansett, and provide a forecast and a base year and a growth rate. Afternoon. Yes. That's correct, yes. I think we do. But again, the intent of this page was to get broad buckets of how we're thinking about the opportunity with the proceeds. And so, I think these all kind of questions get back to the same point. I have to reiterate that we're not through with the business plan yet. So, we're trying to provide some level of detail to you in the interim as we think about this and we work through the plans, putting the -- Vince talked about this. Putting those proceeds, if you will, to the capital, we think is a better use of that capital ultimately to do the work that we need to do on the system and provide the network that customers need and do it in an affordable way. But we're not done and we just need to work through the full of the plan. Thanks."

            "name": "Vincent Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our Third Quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 in the agenda for today's call, I'll begin this morning with an update on the progress we continue to make in advancing our strategic repositioning. I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL 's Clean Energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update. Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of Third Quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  Turning to slide 4, We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. With FERC' s approval, we now have 4 of the 5 approvals necessary to close on the transaction. We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. In its procedural schedule, the division has established February 25th as the target date for a decision.  This would put PPL and National Grid on a path to close on the transaction by March of next year, as originally expected. We've included a slide with the divisions procedural schedule in the appendix of today's presentation. As we pursue the final regulatory approval, we continue working closely with National Grid on planning to ensure a smooth transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. Together, we've collaborated through 30 functional integration teams to plan and execute a safe, effective, and minimally disruptive transition of the Rhode Island operations.  These teams have built robust day 1 integration plans to execute on identified business requirements, drafted transition service agreements that will be key to providing a stable, seamless transition for customers, redesigned critical business processes to enable the TSAs to effectively operate, designed a new Rhode Island operating model and organization from the ground up, with over 1,100 National Grid employees accepting employment offers pending the close of the transaction. We have initiated an integrated change management and communication strategy to engage our future employees, customers, and Rhode Island stakeholders to begin to build relationships for the long-term; and all 3 labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership.  As we work to secure final approval, we look forward to partnering with the talented team in Rhode Island to deliver safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy. And we're very excited about the opportunity the acquisition presents to build one of the nation's most advanced clean energy enabling grids in support of Rhode Island's ambitious decarbonization goals. Finally, on this slide, I'm excited to highlight a new, valuable addition to PPL's Board of Directors, Heather Redman. Heather is the Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Flying Fish Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in early-stage artificial intelligence, machine learning startups, including energy-related applications.  She brings expertise in disruptive technologies, industry transformation, energy development and energy technology at a time when PPL is squarely focused on driving innovation and positioning our Company for growth in the clean energy transition. I am confident that Heather will be a fantastic addition to our diverse and experienced Board. With Heather's addition, our board now has ten directors, 60% of whom are diverse, and 30% of whom are women. Turning to Slide 5 in advancing our strategic repositioning, we also continue to make progress in deploying proceeds from the sale of our U.K. assets to maximize share owner value.  And while we recognize cash is fungible, we are showing the major buckets for the use of proceeds on this slide, and today, we've announced 2 updates. First, as we continue to develop our business plans, we've identified at least a billion dollars in incremental capital investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky through 2025 to support grid resilience in modernization and advance a sustainable energy future for our customers. The identified CapEx opportunities predominantly in the T&D areas include continued application of smart grid technologies, which improved overall system reliability and reduce O&M cost at the same time.  It also includes further hardening of the system to support reliability and resilience in the face of more frequent and stronger storms. We'll look to make the same types of investments in Rhode Island once we closed the transaction and work with Rhode Island stakeholders on the pace of change to the Clean Energy economy in the state, keeping in mind the cost impacts for customers. In addition to our updates on CapEx opportunities, we've also revised our expectations for share repurchases and have allocated an additional $500 million to buy backs. We now expect to repurchase a total of approximately $1 billion dollars of PPL common stock by year-end, effectively doubling the amount previously announced on our Q2 call. We've already completed $550 million in share repurchases through October 31st. We're pleased about the progress we've made in evaluating our capital plans and look forward to sharing additional details at an Analyst Day following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition.  In the meantime, we'll continue to review our business plans for additional opportunities that will drive value for both customers and shareowners. We're also providing an update on the timing of an expected change to PPL 's dividend and reiterate the planned dividend policy following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. The dividend has and will remain an important part of PPL 's total shareowner return proposition. Given the procedural schedule in place for the required regulatory approval in Rhode Island, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate through the January, 2022 payment.  After that date, we plan to realign the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 60 to 65% of the repositioned PPL earnings as previously communicated. The final decision regarding the dividend will be made by the Board of Directors after the Narragansett closing. Moving to Slide 6, We continue to advance our clean energy strategy as we pursue our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In October, our Kentucky utilities filed renewable power purchase agreements with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to provide a combined 125 megawatts of solar power to 5 major customers.  Under the 20-year agreements, which will support customer participation in LGNE & KU's Green Tariff, LGNE & KU will procure 100% of the power from a new solar facility that will be built in Western Kentucky. The agreements reflect our continued efforts to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in the state. In another notable third quarter development, we announced in September that we've joined in expanding coalition of U.S. utilities committed to supporting the growth of electric vehicles as we seek additional opportunities to enable third party decarbonization. The Electric Highway Coalition will focus on development of a seamless network of rapid electric vehicle charging stations connecting major highway systems from the northeast to the midwest, down to Texas.  The goal is to create convenient options for long distance EV travel to reduce range anxiety for consumers. We also continue to expand investments in R&D needed to achieve net-zero. Our Kentucky Utilities recently announced a partnership to study the capture of carbon-dioxide emissions. The partnership with the University of Kentucky 's Center for Applied Energy Research or CAER will seek to develop cost-effective, scalable technology to capture carbon-dioxide from a natural gas-combined cycle plant.  We'll be working with CAER in using the carbon capture infrastructure we've already built at our brown coal facility in 2014 to simulate emissions from a natural gas plant. The project will also support a study aimed at direct air capture of CO2, potentially creating a negative emissions power plant. In addition to capturing CO2, the system aims to produce two value-added streams, hydrogen and oxygen, that can be sold to offset the cost of capturing and storing the CO2. Additional partners in this R&D initiative include Vanderbilt University and EPRI and GTI through their low carbon resources initiative.  The carbon capture unit we've built at the Brown plant is one of only a few carbon capture systems in operation today at Power Plants in the United States. Furthering our R&D related efforts, PPL recently acquired an ownership interest in the SOO Green project, a 350-mile underground transmission project that seeks to connect the MISO, and PJM power markets, and support growing demand for clean energy. We recognized that expanding the nation's transmission grid will be critical to connecting more wind and solar power and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Breaking through citing, permitting, and other barriers to build this transmission quickly and cost-effectively will be key. SOO Green seeks to tackle these challenges by developing high-voltage transmission lines underground along major rail corridors.  PPL's investment in the SOO Green project will enable us to gain valuable insight into this innovative approach. We look forward to lending our capabilities and transmission expertise to support this project success. Turning to Slide 7. On October 19th, LGNE & KU submitted their triennial joint integrated resource plan to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides the commission with information regarding our potential generation sources over the next 15 years, to meet forecasted energy demand in a lease cost manner.  The IRP is submitted for informational purposes. It represents a moment in time look at ongoing resource planning using current business assumptions and long-term forecast. LGNE & KU 's 2021 IRP projects, a significant reduction in coal's contribution to our generation mix declining from over 80% of the expected electricity produced in 2021, to about half of the total power produced in 2036. In our base case scenario for load and fuel prices, we show the retirement of nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal capacity as we economically advance to Clean Energy transition.  These projected retirements are consistent with the depreciation study filed in our last [Indiscernible], as well as the estimates used in developing our net zero goal announced last quarter. The IRP -based demand and base fuel price scenario envisions solar power playing a growing role in meeting our customers demand for energy. Over the next 15 years, accounting for nearly 20% of all the power we supply to our Kentucky customers by 2036. This scenario shows an additional 2,100 megawatts of solar combined with 200 megawatts of battery storage along with simple cycle gas units needed for reliability purposes, by the end of the planning period to replace those 2,000 megawatts of expected coal plant retirements. We've also added a high case scenario to this slide which reflects the implications of higher demand and higher fuel prices due to several factors.  Under the high case scenario, we would expect there to be significantly more energy needed by 2036, requiring additional capacity. Based on our assumptions, that would primarily be met with an additional 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewable and storage resources above the base case scenario through that time period. Further, that would result in more than twice as much output from renewable resources by 2036, reflecting approximately 40% of generation output, primarily replacing natural gas from the base - case scenario. We've provided a slide and the appendix of today's presentation that outlines the differences in the assumptions for the base and high-k scenarios.  We expect the next IRP, which will be filed in 2024, to be an extremely important plan based on the current timing of our next coal plant retirements, which are expected to begin again in 2024. Moving to Slide 8. On August 20th, PPL Electric Utilities announced a constructive settlement with an alliance of industrial and municipal customers that have challenged the Company's FERC -approved base transmission return on equity.  The settlement, which must be approved by FERC, would change PPL Electric's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% from May 2020 to May 2022 with a rate stepping up to 10% by June 2023. The settlement also updates the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of its actual equity component calculated in accordance with the formula rate template or 56%. The settlement also allows PPL Electric to modify the current formula rate, which is based on a historic test year, and move the Company to a projected [Indiscernible] year. Further PPL's formula rate could also be modified to be based on the calendar year moving forward, rather than the current rate year that begins, June 1.  We expect these changes to help reduce regulatory lag as we continue to make additional investments in transmission infrastructure. Overall, the settlement is expected to reduce Net Income by approximately $25 million to $30 million per year. The details of the FERC transmission ROE settlement are included in the appendix of today's presentation. In other operational developments our utilities continue to be recognized for our award-winning customer service and innovation. PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities were once again listed as 2 of the most trusted utility brands in the United States based on a recent study performed by human behavior firm, Escalent.  The results of the study showed that communications played a vital role in building brand trust between utilities and our customers in 2020 during the pandemic. It was the third consecutive year PPL Electric received this recognition and the second consecutive year Kentucky Utilities. Also, The Association of Edison Illuminating Companies selected PPL Electric Utilities as a winner of one of their 2021 achievement awards for revolutionary work in vegetation management. Trees are a common cause of outages.  Within PPL Electric Utilities service territory, it's estimated that about a third of distribution outages over the past 5 years were caused by trees contacting overhead wires. By using a new approach that leverages data analytics and other new technologies, PPL Electric Utilities found ways to trim and remove the right trees at the right times across 28,000 miles of overhead lines to help prevent outages. This has led to improved reliability despite an increase in more severe weather without increasing overall vegetation management costs. Additionally, Public Utilities Fortnightly has named PPL Electric Utilities as a top innovator for 2021.  Thanks to its industry-leading use of dynamic line rating or DLR technology on its transmission line. By using smart sensors that collect real-time information like wind speed and line temperature, operators can relieve transmission congestion and increase the electricity sent over those lines. PPL Electric Utilities has been recognized for its leading-edge approach to integrating DLR into core operations and using data from the sensors to make [Indiscernible] investment decisions. And finally, we continue our efforts to support economic development in the regions we serve.  One recent major development in this area is for its announcement of plans to construct a $6 billion electric battery complex within our LGNE & KU service territory. It is one of, if not the largest economic development announcement in Kentucky 's history, and will have far reaching positive impacts on communities around the Commonwealth. In fact, 2021 has been a record year for Kentucky in terms of economic development growth with over $10 billion in new investments being announced within the state. Further recent developments in addition to Ford's announcement include a $460 million investment by Toyota and a $450 million investment by GE at its appliance park in Louisville. These decisions exemplify the strengths that Kentucky has to offer large industrial customers. Specifically, we are known for exceptional reliability to deliver energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Further, we have some of the lowest retail rates in the country, an important characteristic for large industrial customers and something we remain keenly focused on maintaining. Kentucky also has the third lowest business costs in the country and is home to 3 global shipping hubs. Our Kentucky service territories are located in a centralized region that is well protected from intensifying coastal storms and other natural disasters.  We are excited to support the energy needs of these developments, and their perspective impact on our surrounding communities. Before we move to the next slide in the broader context, I would also note that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and the States Office of Energy Policy unveiled a new energy strategy on October 20th called E3. The strategy considers 3 E's as key pillars to the strategic vision of a resilient economy in the state: Energy, the environment, and economic development. And this strategy aligns very well with PPL's Clean Energy transition strategy.  We're encouraged by several areas included in the strategy where our utilities will play a vital role and we expect will provide future opportunities. Including ensuring a transmission grid that supports growing renewable resources. Ensuring an electric distribution grid that is self-healing, self-sufficient and auto sensing. Supporting a diversified energy supply that is fuel-secure, sustainable, and resilient, incentivizing sustainable business investments including hydrogen and other renewable fuels.  Supporting the development of carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration industries, and supporting alternative fuel transportation infrastructure. LG&E and KU participated in working groups associated with affordability and economic development in the lead up to the state announcing its strategy. We believe the strategic framework represents a comprehensive approach to positioning Kentucky for success in a changing energy landscape.  We look forward to engaging with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state further develops its strategy to support sustainability, boost competitiveness can spur job growth and innovation in local and regional economies. I will now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe. Thank you, Joe. In summary, as we work to complete our strategic repositioning, I remain incredibly excited about our future. We continue to build momentum throughout 2021 in executing our strategic objectives. And I'm confident we will emerge from our transformation, a leading U.S. energy Company, stronger, more agile, and better positioned to advance the Clean Energy transition to deliver utilities of the future and to drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. With that operator, let's open the call for questions. Hey, Shar. I'll have Greg talk about where we're seeing the $1 billion that we've identified today. And again, we continue to review the business plans. And so, as we put on the slide, we think that'll come in at about 1 to 2 billion as we finalized the plans. On the Rhode Island side, Shar, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head.  That's an area where I think we'll have a pretty good sense on what the opportunity is, in Rhode Island as we think about the Clean Energy transition on what we've done in Pennsylvania, bringing that grid to Rhode Island to support the renewable ambitions within the state. Of course, there's going to be offshore wind opportunities that we need to get rid -- ready for, as well as significant [Indiscernible] in the state. There's also a lot of transmission opportunity.  So there -- I think we'll have a pretty good sense of what needs to be done. The question will be, it will have to work with the state on how quickly they want to get to the new Clean Energy transition; especially keeping -- just keeping rates in check, which of course we do across all of our jurisdictions. So, I think it's probably a little premature to provide too much detail on that right now. But qualitatively, I would say, I think we'll have a pretty good sense of the opportunity when it happens, we'll need to engage with the state. But Greg, do you want to touch on the billion that we've already identified? Yes, Shar. Did you say organic or inorganic moves? Yeah. I just want to make sure I heard your question properly. So, I would say in general as we think about the capital allocation [Indiscernible] investing in the utilities is our priority and our bias, especially as we try to make sure that we're delivering [Indiscernible] that our customers need as we look at the transition to a Clean Energy future. So being able to fund that in a way that requires little to no equity issuances over the foreseeable future is incredibly important to us which is really how Joe and the team identify the $3.5 billion of debt that we bought down with part of the proceeds and getting the Balance Sheet in that position where we can fund not only this billion, but even incremental capital to your point with Rhode Island and other potential opportunities that we may identify without issuing equity.  So that's the first component of that. In terms of the stock buybacks themselves, again, we're looking at that versus other potential opportunities. And you mentioned inorganic. I talked about last quarter; we don't need M&A to hit the growth profile that we've communicated. Of course, we will be opportunistic as we always have been with M&A. But our -- I would say our focus in the M&A area right now, Shar, is to close Rhode Island, get the integration underway, and really ensure that we have a smooth transition there.  And then as we talked about before, working with the state on the pace of change for the Clean Energy transition up in Rhode Island and then making sure that we're supporting that with the capital and investment plans. So, our focus, I would say, on M&A right now is squarely on that. But as I always say, you never say never. If there's an opportunity that presents itself that we think would create incremental shareholder value above our organic growth plans, certainly it's something that we would consider as we've done in the past; but it's not the core of our strategy right now. Sure. Thanks. Good morning. Yes. Joe, why don't you tell him about how we're thinking about that. [Indiscernible] so for -- through 2028, I would say, certainly through '24 which is our next projected coal plant retirement. We don't think we require significant, if any, replacement generation for our '24 retirements. So really the reserve margin starts to tighten when we start to get into the 2028 timeframe. And so, as you can see in the -- on Slide 18, which is the IRP megawatts that we're talking about under the base case and then the high case.  Over the 15-year period, which is really where again, it's post 28 when you see more significant retirements and then ultimate replacement for the increase in energy that we're projecting, both in the base case and then in the high case. We're thinking in the base case, there's probably around $3 billion up investment opportunity over that 15-year period.  Significantly more in the high case, obviously, you're seeing 5600 additional megawatts significantly more renewables in that case, and so the investment opportunity under high case would be -- call it around $10 billion plus or minus, so that's a significant opportunity. As we -- I should clarify, that like the Ford announcement, and some of the other announcements I talked about we're not necessarily in the base case.  They don't necessarily get us to the high case. As again, the high case has EV assumptions, and electric heat assumptions, very high gas prices over that sustained period. Obviously, all of that is still to be determined but I would say the positive thing with the Ford and the other announcements I talked about, at least on the major new customer additions were certainly trending towards the high case versus the base case.  So, the investment opportunity calls it $3 to $10 billion depending on the cases. Not a significant amount in the next 5 years. You might start to see some in 2026 as we plan for the 2028 retirees. But it's really, I would say, just following that time period is when you'll see more significant investment. Great. Thanks. Hey, Durgesh. Yes. I would just reiterate, I think, what we've talked about in the past. We've said we expect to have a competitive EPS growth rate off of our '22 midpoint when we come out with that, and as you know, that range is anywhere from 4% to 8%. But I would say most of the ranges within that are even tighter in the 5% to 7% range, and so we would expect to be solidly in that range. Yes, so we increased the share repurchases from $500 to a billion. And so, it's about 0.5 billion lefts, right? Sure, thanks. Way and combining that with underground high-voltage transmission. And so, for us, it's not about the size of the investment, it's for -- it's really a way for us to be part of an innovative project that hopefully could cut through some of those issues that we all know plague many transmission projects. And so, we're really trying to -- Greg, I don't know if there's anything specific regarding those issues that you're willing and able to talk to? Okay. Thanks, Paul. Good morning. Under 29 bucks? Yes. So on -- just in general on the load, I think what we're seeing [Indiscernible] PA we're seeing kind of C&I come back to pretty close to pre - COVID levels. They are a little bit short as you -- we have slides in the deck that show the load and that's really -- things that you're seeing across the country. So, retail and hospitality that those have not fully come back yet. We're seeing the same thing down in Kentucky on that with the commercial. Industrial in Kentucky of course, just a lot of the shutdown issues that we had during COVID, that's all recovered. But with the chip shortages and some of the supply chain issues, we're seeing some of the factories being turned back.  So that's why a little bit short on the C&I side. And then on the residential, we're just seeing in Pennsylvania a lot more workers are still working from home and what we're seeing in Kentucky. So, for the most part, Kentucky is back to pre - COVID. Again, it's a little bit positive, but in PA, we're still quite a bit positive. So, we'll -- we're still waiting to see how much of that remains permanent, Ryan, in terms of load, in terms -- with hybrid work schedules and just more flexibility that companies are providing their workforce.  So, I guess our expectation would be that residential stays slightly above, but that remains to be seen. And then in terms of the announcements that we talked about, probably a little premature to talk about the low, the exact load impacts on those and when they will cut, and when that will show up. We really in the case of Ford plant, the final designs need to be prepared and released. So, I think while certainly qualitatively this is positive for our jurisdiction in the state in general, and I think it will be it'll actually fuel, additional announcements and opportunities for folks that want to come into the state.  Again, we're on top of the E3 energy strategy that the governor announced, I think this all goes very well for economic development opportunities within Kentucky, which I think qualitatively is good for our jurisdictions in our service areas. But putting that into, say, a megawatt of load, I think it's a little premature for that. But as soon as we can do that, we will get that disclosure out. Yes. I'll let Greg talk about that. Thanks, Ryan. Yes, Steve, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific M&A opportunities in the market or even hypotheticals for that matter. So, I would just say, on the M&A front, we're focused on Rhode Island and getting that. Not only to complete it but then, the transition to happen in very smooth way and then get off the TSAs and get fully under our ownership. So that's where our focus is. I'll let Joe talk to that. But Steve. I think to your point and just to solidify what Joe is saying, So, when we look at that $1 to $2 billion and this is kind of to your point, I think. We can fund that range without additional equity going forward, so. And that I think that's kind of to you -- That's kind of to your point. I think. Thanks [Indiscernible]. How are you? Yes. But again, the balance sheet is set up so that we can fund our CapEx growth without issuing equity. So, the balance sheet is strong enough to fund all that, Anthony. Yes. So, the -- I think Greg said it was relatively evenly split across the years, not between PA and Kentucky. I think this initial billion we've identified is actually more weighted to Pennsylvania than it is Kentucky, [Indiscernible]. Great. Thanks. Great, just want to thank everyone for joining us on the call and we're looking forward to engaging with everybody next week at EI. So, thanks, everybody."

[Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation Second Quarter Investor Update. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation and earnings release, which we will discuss during today's call, contain forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. Participating on our call this morning are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO, Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer, and Greg Dudkin, Chief Operating Officer. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you Andy, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 in the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an overview of the exciting quarter we've had here at PPL, including an update on our strategic repositioning, our newly announced net-zero emissions goal, along with a brief operational update. Joe will then provide a detailed review of second quarter financial results, and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4, the second quarter has been a busy one, as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company. First, we completed the sale of our UK utility, achieving exceptional value for the business, and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as a high-growth U.S.-regulated utility company. As a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. We also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt, which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility. Regarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy, as well as the repurchase of PPL shares. On the topic of share repurchases, our Board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock. We currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value. The actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds. We believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility. I'll note that we are in the process of re-evaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers. As a result, we have removed our prior capital and rate-based projection from our presentation. We'll provide further updates to our capital and rate-based plans after we complete this review. The UK sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning, simplifying our structure with a clear focus on U.S. rate-regulated utilities, and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth. We're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island. To date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements, and on July 16th, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition. We continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which are the two remaining approvals required for the transaction. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year, with hopes of closing before year-end. As we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. We've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island utility. Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly 4 decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities, will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction. Dave is well-positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island, as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and to support the state's decarbonization goals. Dave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced, and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers. Moving to Slide 5. In addition to strong execution towards our strategic repositioning, we also continue to advance our clean energy transition strategy and announced the new net-zero carbon emissions goal this morning. This goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation, as well as other aspects of our business, as outlined in the footnote on the slide. PPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to ensure a balanced, responsible, and just transition for our employees, communities, and customers as we advance towards our clean energy goals. Our new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts. Based on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal. As a result, in addition to today's announced net-zero emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035. In addition, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics, and goals that will guide our path to net-zero emissions. We've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor. In addition to this strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment, to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements. Our last Climate Assessment Report was published in 2017. Our updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees celsius. As we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky. LG&E and KU submit an IRP once every three years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission, and the next IRP will be filed in October of this year. Both the climate assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goal. Wrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs. This is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors. With that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy. And we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area, to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net-zero. PPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative being led by EPRI and the Gas Technology Institute, and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board working group. We also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation towards a sustainable energy future. Through our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating the shift to a low-carbon future and driving commercial-scale solutions needed to deliver deep economy-wide decarbonization. Apart from LCRI and EIPs investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid. These collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies, that can be leveraged to advance to clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our work and support in this area. Moving to Slide 6. We've outlined our updated path to net-zero carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal fire generation capacity in Kentucky, which is consistent with the generation planning and analysis study included in our recently approved rate case filings. It\u2019s clear that we'll need to advance technology to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 as we balance the need for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for our customers. Based on these current factors and consistent with our most recent rate case filings in Kentucky, we currently expect to achieve a reduction in our coal-fired capacity of 70% by 2035, 90% by 2040, and 95% by 2050 from our baseline in 2010. We anticipate having about 550 megawatts of remaining coal-fired generation in 2050 due to our highly efficient and relatively new Trimble County Unit 2 that started commercial operation in 2011. Therefore, our objective is to continue to explore innovative ways through our R&D efforts to economically drive these reductions further, while supporting our customers and local communities. We have also assessed the implications of advancing these goals even further. Our internal view of what it could take to achieve 100% carbon-free generation by 2035, as proposed by the Biden administration, using current technologies would create significant affordability issues for our customers. Our new commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, is backed by the actions that we are and will continue to take to support a low carbon energy system that is affordable, and reliable, and provides the time needed for the technology to advance. Next on Slide 7, I'll cover the details of the Kentucky rate cases. On June 30th, the KPSC approved the settlements that LG&E and KU had reached with parties to their rate reviews with certain modifications. At a high level, the order support continued investment to modernize our energy infrastructure, strengthen grid resilience, and upgrade LG&E 's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability for those we serve. Effective July 1st, the KPSC authorized a combined $199 million increase in annual revenue for LG&E and KU, within the allowed base ROE of 9.425%, and a 9.35% ROE for the environmental cost recovery and gas line tracker mechanisms. In addition, the KPSC approved a $53 million economic release sur-credit that was proposed by LG&E and KU, to help mitigate the impact of rate adjustments until mid-2022. Importantly, the commission's order authorized the full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, which will empower customers with detailed energy usage information, enable LG&E and KU to respond more quickly to power outages, and improve operational efficiency. We continue to believe the resulting O&M savings from installing advanced meters will exceed the cost of this investment for the benefit of our customers. The $350 million capital costs of the proposed AMI investment are not included in the new rates that took effect July 1st. Instead, we will record our investment in the AMI projects as SEAWIP and accrue AFUDC during the projects implementation period. The KPSC also approved a very constructive retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and a return on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. The rider will provide cost recovery over 10 years upon retirement of such assets as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than the weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The Retired Asset Recovery Rider balances the interests of all stakeholders and provides certainty of recovery for the prudent investments made in these coal plants. Under the settlement agreements approved by the KPSC, LG&E and KU have committed that they will not increase the new base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. And before leaving this slide, I would note that in approving the settlement agreements, the Commission adjusted the proposed base ROE downward from 9.55% to 9.425%, and disallowed the recovery of certain legal costs. These modifications reduced the annual revenue requirements proposed in the settlements by approximately $20 million. We have filed a request for a limited rehearing on these matters. And finally, turning to Slide 8. In other highlights across PPL, we continue to achieve recognition for our strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, innovation, and safety. During the second quarter, PPL was recognized by DiversityInc in 2 distinct areas: first, as one of the top utilities in the nation for workforce diversity, and second, as one of the top 50 companies for ESG, determined by several factors including our programs and practices surrounding talent in the workforce, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy, supplier diversity programs, and overall leadership and governance. PPL has also been named the best place to work for disability inclusion for the fourth consecutive year, earning a perfect score on the 2021 disability equality index. And finally, PPL Electric Utilities received the South Eastern Electric Changes Chairman's Award for its groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to downed power lines. These awards reflect a corporate strategy focused on creating value for all stakeholders as grounded in our five strategic priorities. These include achieving industry-leading performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability, maintaining a strong financial foundation and creating long-term value for our shareholders, fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace, and building strong communities in the areas we serve. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update, Joe.\nJoseph Bergstein: Thank you Vince, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 10. Today we announce Second Quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a UK tax rate change, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by earnings from the UK utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations. I'll note that the tax-related item was a non-cash adjustment before the completion of the sale of WPD in June. Adjusting for these special items, the second-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.19 per share compared with $0.20 per share a year ago. We remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales. These higher sales were offset by several factors, which I will cover in the next slide. Let's move to Slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second quarter segment results. As a reminder, we've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amounts to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the UK regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. The total amount of these costs was about $0.02 per share for the Quarter. Turning to the ongoing segment results. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment results were $0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower peak transmission demand as discussed in Q1 and consistent with our expectations, and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission-based return on equity. Partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments. We also experienced an additional $0.01 decline due to favorable tax-related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, results were $0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in Q2 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial industrial demand revenue as we experience strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of COVID-19 and lower interest expense primarily due to the interest cost previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in corporate and other. Partially offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were flat compared with a year ago. Higher interest costs of a penny, a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the Kentucky segment, were offset by several factors that were not individually significant. Turning to Slide 12, I'll cover some notable financing-related updates. First, following the sale of the UK utility business, we successfully completed a series of financing activities in June and July that led to a significant reduction in Holding Company debt. The result was a total reduction of PPL Capital Funding debt by about $3.5 billion, which was in line with our previously discussed targets. Through these actions, we've reduced total Holding Company debt to about 20% of PPL's total outstanding debt, while effectively clearing all near-term maturities at PPL Capital Funding through 2025. We've provided a detailed breakdown of these actions in the appendix of today's presentation. In addition to the activity at PPL Capital Funding, we redeemed at par $250 million at LG&E and KU energy in July, which was part of our original financing plan for the year to simplify the capital structure of the Company by eliminating intermediate holding Company debt. That was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the LKE entity. Therefore, we have deregistered LKE as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity. We expect PPL capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding Company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries. The successful execution of liability management leaves PPL well-positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post-closing of the Narragansett Electric acquisition. In addition to these notable financing updates, we also reduced outstanding short-term debt as efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of WPD. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In summary, as we continue to execute our strategic priorities, I am incredibly excited about PPL's future. We continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers. We continue to evolve our clean energy strategy and drive innovation across our Company. We completed the sale of our UK utility business, achieving outstanding value for our shareowners. We're on track to close on our Narragansett acquisition within the expected timeframes. And the new PPL will emerge from our strategic repositioning, as a much stronger Company, one poised for long-term growth and success. With that Operator, let's open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] [Operator instructions]. Today's first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning, guys.\nVincent Sorgi: Morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: So first off, looking at the 2.5 billion that remains unallocated after the \u201821 buyback, how should we think about the timing of the allocation decision-making process? I mean, maybe put differently, how long will it take to evaluate the CapEx opportunity set across the footprint? What are the trigger points there, if any? Is it the Kentucky IRP? Is it Rhode Island closure? I mean, I guess, Vince, how long will you sit on it, and is the door completely closed on an outright regulated utility acquisition at this point? Maybe just give us a little bit of a sense of the background and the process that you just went through. Thanks.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure. You hit a lot in that question Shar. In terms of timing, I would say that we're not really setting an arbitrary timeline to complete this. We want to make sure that we're going through this process in a disciplined and diligent way as we always do, so not really setting an artificial timeline on that, but to your point, you mentioned many of the factors that really are going into the process. So we're in the middle right now of assessing the capital plans, including for Rhode Island once acquired, and we do see additional T&D opportunities across the utilities, Again, including Rhode Island, for the benefit of our customers to drive improved efficiency and resiliency of the networks, as well as additional gas LDC investments to further enhance the safety of those operations. And again, from a capital deployment perspective, we think deploying capital into the utilities can create significant value for all of our customers and our shareowners. A lot of work going on right now going through that. You mentioned having the closure of Rhode Island, that's obviously a key component of how we think about capital deployment moving forward within the utilities. In terms of timing, we'll want to see the closure of getting the deals on. You also mentioned the IRP in Kentucky, that as well as the Climate Assessment Report, will be key inputs into our Clean Energy strategy going forward, there could be some capital deployment opportunities coming out of that. I think you hit all the points in terms of the areas that we're looking at that will ultimately drive the organic use of the remaining proceeds. In terms of M&A, I would just say that first of all, we don't need M&A to hit the targets that we're -- that we are targeting from both earnings and a growth perspective, and we will continue to be disciplined as we look at M&A opportunities as we always have been. I'll just say that the current valuations that we're seeing in the market are quite high. The utilities are trading quite expensively right now. We didn't pay anywhere near some of those valuations for Rhode Island, and we continue to think the Rhode Island [Indiscernable] will drive value for our shareowners. It will be earnings accretive, credit accretive, and value accretive for our shareowners. So again, from our perspective, maintaining discipline is incredibly important and we'll continue to do that.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And not to paraphrase, it just sounds like your organic Capex opportunities are the best use of the residual cash flows versus coming out and doing something inorganic in this kind of a market.\nVincent Sorgi: Well, again, I would say, never say never, but it's not impossible to create value at these valuations, but it is tough. So we'll continue to look at inorganic opportunities, strategic opportunities, but again, maintaining that discipline as we think about capital deployment opportunities organically as I talked about, but also share buybacks as well.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly from you Vince, what is the Board's decision mean for maybe the timing of the dividend adjustment, and just remind us on the targeted payout range in the long term. Thank you.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So we will come out with the dividend guidance and all of that once we close the Rhode Island transaction. At that point in time, we'll be able to come out with our earnings guidance, what's the growth rate, of the range on the growth rate for earnings. As we've indicated, we expect, once we adjust the dividend to a targeted payout of around 60% to 65%, we would expect to be able to grow that going forward in line with our earnings. And all of that will be communicated once we close the Rhode Island transaction.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect thanks a lot and congrats on the execution. I'll pass it to someone else. Thank you.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you Shar.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning team, and thanks for the update today. Maybe just going back to the use of proceeds, can you just talk -- one of the things the press release says Vince, is the opportunities organically with your current assets, maybe can you just elaborate on them. Where do you see those opportunities, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Rhode Island all three, maybe just a little bit more color?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Thanks, Durgesh. I think we see opportunity across the entire portfolio once we acquire Rhode Island, of course, we need to get through the regulatory process in Rhode Island, we will be meeting with the Governor and the legislature up there, as well as the commission and regulatory bodies on putting together what we think the best investment plan moving forward for Rhode Island will be. We've talked about the Clean Energy aspirations that the state has, they are quite aggressive when you compare them to other states, which we completely think we can support with what we've been able to accomplish in Pennsylvania and be able to replicate that up there. I think for us Durgesh, it's really about working with the state stakeholders and identify how quickly they want to move on that and then how quickly can we deploy our operating model and keep it affordable for our customers. We see tremendous opportunity up there, but that's something that we'll be working on once we close the deal. Having said that, I think we see continued opportunity both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky to continue to bring those utilities along the utility of the futures curve and continue to make investments in PA and Kentucky as well. So those are the activities we're going through right now over the summer and we'll be in a position to communicate that again once the Rhode Island deal closes and we come out with the whole story.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Looks like opportunities are throughout your existing platform. Then maybe just I'm curious, 500 million this year in share buybacks. Why 500 million?\nVincent Sorgi: Yeah, we just thought that it struck a nice balance in terms of deploying the proceeds in an efficient manner, do some buybacks, but also provide us with the financial flexibility to continue to assess alternatives against further buyback. So we just felt that that was a nice balance, Durgesh. And again, we'll continue to look at the other opportunities between now and certainly closing of the deal, but potentially a little bit after that as well.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then just to be clear, you had roughly 3.5 billion in proceeds left after the Narragansett acquisition. So with the 500 million shares back, you would have roughly 3 billion in excess cash to be deployed; is that correct?\nVincent Sorgi: No, I think it's closer to 2 billion to 2.5 billion.\nJoseph Bergstein: That's right.\nVincent Sorgi: After the liability management.\nJoseph Bergstein: And the buyback subject, yes. So after the --\nVincent Sorgi: And the buyback, yeah.\nJoseph Bergstein: Right. Including liability management.\nDurgesh Chopra: So 2 to 2.5?\nJoseph Bergstein: Right.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thank you very much.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure.\nJoseph Bergstein: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ryan Greenwald of BofA, please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin: Hey guys, it's Julien on. Thanks again for the moment here. If I can go back and clarify the last couple of questions here. Just on timing, just to make sure we heard you right. You specifically designated 0.5 billion for '21, or at least the balance of the year here, as well as, if you think about the next few months, you should start to get some clarity on the CapEx? So when you think about that available capital here, you're going to get the clarity of what is \u201cremaining\u201d in the not-too-distant future? I just want to make sure at least from an available visibility perspective, you'll know pretty soon?\nVincent Sorgi: I mean, certainly we'll be working that through the summer, and through the business planning process, Julien. We, of course, need to take all that to the Board, get all that approved, and so in terms of publicly being able to disclose at an outset, still, I think that will coincide with the closing of the deal. If that happens before our year-end earnings call, as you know we normally would provide an update on the capital plans at our year-end call. If the deal goes beyond the year-end call, then certainly we would expect to provide that update then. But again, if the deal closes prior to the call, I think you could expect it in concert with the deal announcement and coming out with a news story, post-deal.\nJulien Dumoulin: Got it. And just to clarify here, I mean, how do you think or rank a transmission asset versus distribution versus other asset types? I know we've talked about this before, but obviously, the market's been fairly volatile. And obviously, if you comment, fairly elevated across the number of these asset classes. So curious if that has driven any rethink. As well as, are you opening minority ownership in assets? I suspect that's equally robust in terms of valuations, but just figured I would throw it out there.\nVincent Sorgi: So T versus D versus other transmissions -- well, first of all, we think as long as the capital deployment serves our customers well and is providing value to our customers, we think that's a good use of capital across all of the business segments. The returns are still strong in all 3, are really in transmission and distribution, but also generation down in Kentucky, as well as gas. But transmission still has slightly higher ROEs than distribution. But again, we're not strained from an ability to finance capital perspective. So it's not like we're deciding whether we're going to do transmission versus distribution.\nJulien Dumoulin: Got it. And the last one, just to clarify this. You went through your portfolio just now on the call a little bit, but the Kentucky Power, Mitchell update here, any read-throughs at all to your planning? Just want to make sure.\nVincent Sorgi: No.\nJulien Dumoulin: Okay. All right. Excellent. Thank you all very much. All the best and I look forward to seeing what you have to say.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure. Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hey, good morning.\nVincent Sorgi: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Just first of all, on Rhode Island, do we have a procedural schedule? I haven't been able to locate one, I was just wondering, do you guys have any key dates on coming up here in Rhode Island?\nVincent Sorgi: We do not. The division has not yet put out the procedural schedule, Paul. So you're not missing it.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then just finally on the EIP and your discussion on the call about technology, the need to find affordable solutions. Wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit further on this. The $50 million investment, is that all in the Elevate Fund, and just how should we think about the accounting on this, are you guys going to be expensing this, or capitalizing it, or how do we think about that?\nVincent Sorgi: Sure. So the -- it's not all going in the Elevate Fund, it is across multiple funds that are driving really the -- some of the funds are focused on the utility of the future and innovation in that space, smart technologies, and others. They're focused on decarbonization technologies, so EVs or energy storage or things like that. So really it cuts across multiple funds within the EIP platform. And from our perspective, the benefit of that, Paul, is that we get -- I mean, not only has EIP demonstrated positive returns in the fund, which takes what traditionally would be a cost center for a Company with R&D efforts, and potentially turn that into neutral to a positive return. But really the strategic value of getting in there is that we get broad feet so we have visibility into the technologies that are emerging in all of these different areas, as we think about the potential for demonstration projects, or just where we think the next breakthrough in technology will come.  Whether that's on carbon capture or energy storage when you have long-duration storage technologies. Various different areas that we're looking at, as we think about getting to net-zero for not only the fleet but economy-wide.\nPaul Patterson: So this -- should we think about this as being your primary vehicle for looking at technology or emerging technology R&D or you mentioned some other things, and I apologize, but I was slightly distracted when you were talking about it. You mentioned I think, EPRI and some other things. I mean, is there -- are you looking for additional investments in this area or? I mean, how should we just -- I'm just wondering how much of an initiative you are putting into this and also if there's any particular technology that you're finding particularly interesting or exciting.\nVincent Sorgi: Well, I would say that EIP is part of it. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the primary R&D avenue, but certainly, it's part of our strategy there. You talked about EPRI and the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative. So I have just recently taken over the Board Working Group Chair role for EPRI, and so we're integrally involved with the expert team in EPRI and looking at various different technologies. Again, as it relates to carbon capture, new nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, all different types of decarbonization technology. Again, EPRI is focused on, what are the technological breakthroughs or the emerging technologies that are currently being looked at, but they're also assessing alternatives to those, and then identifying demonstration projects down the road to try to commercialize some of these newer technologies. And so we are actively engaged with them on all of that depending on how those things evolve, whether it's hydrogen for storage or even hydrogen blending for gas LVCs or combined cycle generation. There's a way to go, I think to prove all that out for hydrogen, but there's a lot of work and a lot of activity going on there. Carbon capture sequestration continues to be an area, again about 80% of the world's energy is coming from fossil fuels still, so for the globe to get to net-zero at some point, we think carbon capture will have to play a role in that, and so EPRI is spending some time on that as well. Again, nuclear, looking at different forms of nuclear modular unitso[, etc, could also play a role by making those units smaller and more adaptable. So a lot of things going on there, Paul, and I think we're -- our strategy is to make sure that we keep our finger on the pulse there. Again, we'll be retiring coal plants this decade and next. And so could there be potential opportunities for demonstration projects on some of those plants? We'll work with the state to see if there are opportunities there, as we think about again, Trimble County 2, which went into service in 2011. And so unless things change at the federal level where that plant will be forced to be shut, Our current projection is that it would continue to be economic in 2015, and so identifying these technological advancements to drive specifically that plant to net-zero. But again, you're going to have combined-cycle fleets that are part of the transition strategy that you've heard from me and many of my --\nPaul Patterson: I think I understood. It's basically a finger on pulse kind of thing is how we should think about this as opposed to saying that we're going to see impacting earnings in any significant way in the next few years. Is that probably the best way to think about it?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, I think so, certainly in the near term.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. I do appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nVincent Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Hey, Vince, just in thinking about I guess two things. One is in thinking about the potential for a more organic capital plan, you have this multi-year deal that you just did in Kentucky. So I'm just kind of curious about the regulatory mechanisms you have to recover and increase in CapEx if that happens over this period? And then secondly, how long are you willing to hold -- sometimes it's hard to raise CapEx to later in the plan, and you have this money up front and actually if you turn it into an actual rate-based number, 2.5 billion is 5 billion of rate-base, it's a lot of rate base. How should we think about how long you're willing to wait to put the money to work so to speak?\nVincent Sorgi: Sure. So I think, maybe I'll answer your second question first. We don't want to put an artificial timeline on the use of the proceeds. So the first step I think is getting through the detailed process of identifying the organic growth opportunities and putting those plans together, and to your point, when do they get staged in, in terms of '22 maybe versus potential feeding into the back part of the five-year plan and then even beyond that. So I would just say the first step is to get through that, and then we'll assess the timing of when that cash is needed, and then see exactly how much is really fitting into the scenario that you're talking about. In terms of the mechanisms, while we're staying out, first of all, I would just say that, again, in Pennsylvania, we've been very successful at growing our rate base and our earnings despite staying out of rate cases, and we haven't had a distribution rate case since January 1st of 2016. But over that time, and again, this is just distribution, we've grown our rate base 6%, 7% CAGR over that time period, and our net income CAGR has pretty much stayed in line with that rate base growth and the way that you're able to do that is obviously, we have some mechanisms within the different jurisdictions that reduce regulatory lag, whether it's the in PA or the ECR, the gas line tracker in Kentucky, of course, we have some in Rhode Island as well, around capital planning. But also when you deploy the capital in many cases you will see operational efficiencies as a result, and so those operational efficiencies can drive a return on that capital even though you're staying out of rate cases. So I will say that our -- we don't think the right answer just because we're staying out of rate cases is not to invest in the networks. It's incredibly important that we continue to reinvest in the networks, and then making sure that we do that in a way that drives efficiency for the customers and drives the return while we are staying out. We have the experience and successfully done that in Pennsylvania, so we'll look to replicate that. But just because we're staying put, we don't think that that means that there won't be a rate base or earnings growth opportunity.\nSteve Fleishman: Great.

            "name": "Vincent Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you Andy, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our second quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 in the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with an overview of the exciting quarter we've had here at PPL, including an update on our strategic repositioning, our newly announced net-zero emissions goal, along with a brief operational update. Joe will then provide a detailed review of second quarter financial results, and walk through some recent actions we've taken to strengthen PPL's balance sheet. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4, the second quarter has been a busy one, as we continue to advance the strategic repositioning of the company. First, we completed the sale of our UK utility, achieving exceptional value for the business, and once again demonstrating our ability to deliver on our strategic priorities to maximize shareowner value. The sale resulted in net cash proceeds of $10.4 billion, which will support the repositioning of PPL as a high-growth U.S.-regulated utility company. As a reminder, we've earmarked $3.8 billion of those proceeds to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. We also deployed some of the proceeds to achieve our previously stated objective of strengthening our balance sheet, utilizing $3.9 billion to retire $3.5 billion of outstanding holding company debt, which will provide the company with substantial financial flexibility. Regarding the remaining proceeds, we continue to review various options as previously discussed, including investing incremental capital at our utilities or in renewable energy, as well as the repurchase of PPL shares. On the topic of share repurchases, our Board recently authorized the company to repurchase up to $3 billion in PPL common stock. We currently expect to repurchase about $500 million by year-end, while we continue to assess other opportunities to deploy proceeds to maximize shareowner value. The actual amount we apply to share repurchases will depend on various factors, including the determination of other uses for the proceeds. We believe our current plan provides a balance of an efficient use of proceeds while still maintaining financial flexibility. I'll note that we are in the process of re-evaluating our capital plans for incremental investment opportunities for the benefit of our customers. As a result, we have removed our prior capital and rate-based projection from our presentation. We'll provide further updates to our capital and rate-based plans after we complete this review. The UK sale represented an important first step in our strategic repositioning, simplifying our structure with a clear focus on U.S. rate-regulated utilities, and strengthening our balance sheet while providing much greater flexibility to support future growth. We're also making great progress in the acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island. To date, we've satisfied our HSR and FCC requirements, and on July 16th, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities granted a waiver of jurisdiction over the sale, streamlining the overall path to regulatory approval for the acquisition. We continue to make progress on securing approvals from FERC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which are the two remaining approvals required for the transaction. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to close the transaction by March of next year, with hopes of closing before year-end. As we pursue the final regulatory approvals, we are working closely with National Grid on transition planning to ensure a seamless transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. We've also announced our planned leadership team for the Rhode Island utility. Dave Bonenberger, who has nearly 4 decades of energy industry experience, including leading both the transmission and distribution businesses at PPL Electric Utilities, will serve as the Rhode Island President upon completion of the transaction. Dave is well-positioned to lead the execution of our operational strategy in Rhode Island, as we seek to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and to support the state's decarbonization goals. Dave will be joined in Rhode Island by former National Grid employees in creating a strong, experienced, and local leadership team with a deep commitment to delivering energy safely and reliably to Rhode Island customers. Moving to Slide 5. In addition to strong execution towards our strategic repositioning, we also continue to advance our clean energy transition strategy and announced the new net-zero carbon emissions goal this morning. This goal encompasses greenhouse gas emissions from our Kentucky generation, as well as other aspects of our business, as outlined in the footnote on the slide. PPL is fully committed to driving innovation to enable net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to ensure a balanced, responsible, and just transition for our employees, communities, and customers as we advance towards our clean energy goals. Our new goal reflects our continuous evaluation of our progress and opportunities through ongoing business and resource planning efforts. Based on our latest reviews, we believe we are on a path to achieve 80% emissions reduction by 2040, a full decade ahead of our prior goal. As a result, in addition to today's announced net-zero emissions goal, we've also accelerated our previous interim goals, now targeting an 80% reduction by 2040 and a 70% reduction by 2035. In addition, we are undertaking an enterprise-wide effort to enhance our clean energy strategy and develop additional programs, metrics, and goals that will guide our path to net-zero emissions. We've hired an industry-leading global consulting firm to assist us in this endeavor. In addition to this strategic initiative, we are completing an updated scenario-based climate assessment, to evaluate the potential impacts to PPL from climate change and potential future requirements. Our last Climate Assessment Report was published in 2017. Our updated assessment, which we intend to publish later this year will analyze multiple scenarios, including a scenario tied to limiting the global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees celsius. As we conduct our climate assessment, our efforts will be informed by our ongoing integrated resource planning activities in Kentucky. LG&E and KU submit an IRP once every three years to the Kentucky Public Service Commission, and the next IRP will be filed in October of this year. Both the climate assessment and the IRP will serve as key inputs as we further define the pathway to achieving our emissions goal. Wrapping up this slide, we recognize that achieving these emissions reductions while maintaining reliability and affordability will require significant advances in clean energy technology and solutions that can be scaled economically to meet the country's energy needs. This is especially true as we support greater electrification of other sectors. With that in mind, investing in research and development is a key pillar of our clean energy strategy. And we continue to look for opportunities to engage in this area, to drive the innovation and solutions necessary to achieve net-zero. PPL, for example, is an anchor sponsor of the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative being led by EPRI and the Gas Technology Institute, and I chair EPRI's LCRI Board working group. We also recently joined Energy Impact Partners global investment platform, which brings together leading companies and entrepreneurs worldwide to foster innovation towards a sustainable energy future. Through our participation in the EIP platform, PPL will support up to $50 million in investments aimed at accelerating the shift to a low-carbon future and driving commercial-scale solutions needed to deliver deep economy-wide decarbonization. Apart from LCRI and EIPs investment platform, we also continue to engage in a number other R&D efforts related to clean energy technologies and enhancing the power grid. These collaborative efforts provide PPL greater visibility into emerging technologies, that can be leveraged to advance to clean energy transition, and we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our work and support in this area. Moving to Slide 6. We've outlined our updated path to net-zero carbon emissions on this slide, along with our current expectations on coal fire generation capacity in Kentucky, which is consistent with the generation planning and analysis study included in our recently approved rate case filings. It's clear that we'll need to advance technology to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 as we balance the need for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for our customers. Based on these current factors and consistent with our most recent rate case filings in Kentucky, we currently expect to achieve a reduction in our coal-fired capacity of 70% by 2035, 90% by 2040, and 95% by 2050 from our baseline in 2010. We anticipate having about 550 megawatts of remaining coal-fired generation in 2050 due to our highly efficient and relatively new Trimble County Unit 2 that started commercial operation in 2011. Therefore, our objective is to continue to explore innovative ways through our R&D efforts to economically drive these reductions further, while supporting our customers and local communities. We have also assessed the implications of advancing these goals even further. Our internal view of what it could take to achieve 100% carbon-free generation by 2035, as proposed by the Biden administration, using current technologies would create significant affordability issues for our customers. Our new commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, is backed by the actions that we are and will continue to take to support a low carbon energy system that is affordable, and reliable, and provides the time needed for the technology to advance. Next on Slide 7, I'll cover the details of the Kentucky rate cases. On June 30th, the KPSC approved the settlements that LG&E and KU had reached with parties to their rate reviews with certain modifications. At a high level, the order support continued investment to modernize our energy infrastructure, strengthen grid resilience, and upgrade LG&E 's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability for those we serve. Effective July 1st, the KPSC authorized a combined $199 million increase in annual revenue for LG&E and KU, within the allowed base ROE of 9.425%, and a 9.35% ROE for the environmental cost recovery and gas line tracker mechanisms. In addition, the KPSC approved a $53 million economic release sur-credit that was proposed by LG&E and KU, to help mitigate the impact of rate adjustments until mid-2022. Importantly, the commission's order authorized the full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, which will empower customers with detailed energy usage information, enable LG&E and KU to respond more quickly to power outages, and improve operational efficiency. We continue to believe the resulting O&M savings from installing advanced meters will exceed the cost of this investment for the benefit of our customers. The $350 million capital costs of the proposed AMI investment are not included in the new rates that took effect July 1st. Instead, we will record our investment in the AMI projects as SEAWIP and accrue AFUDC during the projects implementation period. The KPSC also approved a very constructive retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and a return on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs. The rider will provide cost recovery over 10 years upon retirement of such assets as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than the weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The Retired Asset Recovery Rider balances the interests of all stakeholders and provides certainty of recovery for the prudent investments made in these coal plants. Under the settlement agreements approved by the KPSC, LG&E and KU have committed that they will not increase the new base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. And before leaving this slide, I would note that in approving the settlement agreements, the Commission adjusted the proposed base ROE downward from 9.55% to 9.425%, and disallowed the recovery of certain legal costs. These modifications reduced the annual revenue requirements proposed in the settlements by approximately $20 million. We have filed a request for a limited rehearing on these matters. And finally, turning to Slide 8. In other highlights across PPL, we continue to achieve recognition for our strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, innovation, and safety. During the second quarter, PPL was recognized by DiversityInc in 2 distinct areas: first, as one of the top utilities in the nation for workforce diversity, and second, as one of the top 50 companies for ESG, determined by several factors including our programs and practices surrounding talent in the workforce, corporate social responsibility and philanthropy, supplier diversity programs, and overall leadership and governance. PPL has also been named the best place to work for disability inclusion for the fourth consecutive year, earning a perfect score on the 2021 disability equality index. And finally, PPL Electric Utilities received the South Eastern Electric Changes Chairman's Award for its groundbreaking technology that safely and automatically cuts power to downed power lines. These awards reflect a corporate strategy focused on creating value for all stakeholders as grounded in our five strategic priorities. These include achieving industry-leading performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability, maintaining a strong financial foundation and creating long-term value for our shareholders, fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace, and building strong communities in the areas we serve. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update, Joe. Thank you, Joe. In summary, as we continue to execute our strategic priorities, I am incredibly excited about PPL's future. We continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers. We continue to evolve our clean energy strategy and drive innovation across our Company. We completed the sale of our UK utility business, achieving outstanding value for our shareowners. We're on track to close on our Narragansett acquisition within the expected timeframes. And the new PPL will emerge from our strategic repositioning, as a much stronger Company, one poised for long-term growth and success. With that Operator, let's open the call for questions. Morning Shar. Sure. You hit a lot in that question Shar. In terms of timing, I would say that we're not really setting an arbitrary timeline to complete this. We want to make sure that we're going through this process in a disciplined and diligent way as we always do, so not really setting an artificial timeline on that, but to your point, you mentioned many of the factors that really are going into the process. So we're in the middle right now of assessing the capital plans, including for Rhode Island once acquired, and we do see additional T&D opportunities across the utilities, Again, including Rhode Island, for the benefit of our customers to drive improved efficiency and resiliency of the networks, as well as additional gas LDC investments to further enhance the safety of those operations. And again, from a capital deployment perspective, we think deploying capital into the utilities can create significant value for all of our customers and our shareowners. A lot of work going on right now going through that. You mentioned having the closure of Rhode Island, that's obviously a key component of how we think about capital deployment moving forward within the utilities. In terms of timing, we'll want to see the closure of getting the deals on. You also mentioned the IRP in Kentucky, that as well as the Climate Assessment Report, will be key inputs into our Clean Energy strategy going forward, there could be some capital deployment opportunities coming out of that. I think you hit all the points in terms of the areas that we're looking at that will ultimately drive the organic use of the remaining proceeds. In terms of M&A, I would just say that first of all, we don't need M&A to hit the targets that we're -- that we are targeting from both earnings and a growth perspective, and we will continue to be disciplined as we look at M&A opportunities as we always have been. I'll just say that the current valuations that we're seeing in the market are quite high. The utilities are trading quite expensively right now. We didn't pay anywhere near some of those valuations for Rhode Island, and we continue to think the Rhode Island [Indiscernable] will drive value for our shareowners. It will be earnings accretive, credit accretive, and value accretive for our shareowners. So again, from our perspective, maintaining discipline is incredibly important and we'll continue to do that. Well, again, I would say, never say never, but it's not impossible to create value at these valuations, but it is tough. So we'll continue to look at inorganic opportunities, strategic opportunities, but again, maintaining that discipline as we think about capital deployment opportunities organically as I talked about, but also share buybacks as well. Yes. So we will come out with the dividend guidance and all of that once we close the Rhode Island transaction. At that point in time, we'll be able to come out with our earnings guidance, what's the growth rate, of the range on the growth rate for earnings. As we've indicated, we expect, once we adjust the dividend to a targeted payout of around 60% to 65%, we would expect to be able to grow that going forward in line with our earnings. And all of that will be communicated once we close the Rhode Island transaction. Thank you Shar. Yes. Thanks, Durgesh. I think we see opportunity across the entire portfolio once we acquire Rhode Island, of course, we need to get through the regulatory process in Rhode Island, we will be meeting with the Governor and the legislature up there, as well as the commission and regulatory bodies on putting together what we think the best investment plan moving forward for Rhode Island will be. We've talked about the Clean Energy aspirations that the state has, they are quite aggressive when you compare them to other states, which we completely think we can support with what we've been able to accomplish in Pennsylvania and be able to replicate that up there. I think for us Durgesh, it's really about working with the state stakeholders and identify how quickly they want to move on that and then how quickly can we deploy our operating model and keep it affordable for our customers. We see tremendous opportunity up there, but that's something that we'll be working on once we close the deal. Having said that, I think we see continued opportunity both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky to continue to bring those utilities along the utility of the futures curve and continue to make investments in PA and Kentucky as well. So those are the activities we're going through right now over the summer and we'll be in a position to communicate that again once the Rhode Island deal closes and we come out with the whole story. Yeah, we just thought that it struck a nice balance in terms of deploying the proceeds in an efficient manner, do some buybacks, but also provide us with the financial flexibility to continue to assess alternatives against further buyback. So we just felt that that was a nice balance, Durgesh. And again, we'll continue to look at the other opportunities between now and certainly closing of the deal, but potentially a little bit after that as well. No, I think it's closer to 2 billion to 2.5 billion. After the liability management. And the buyback, yeah. Sure. I mean, certainly we'll be working that through the summer, and through the business planning process, Julien. We, of course, need to take all that to the Board, get all that approved, and so in terms of publicly being able to disclose at an outset, still, I think that will coincide with the closing of the deal. If that happens before our year-end earnings call, as you know we normally would provide an update on the capital plans at our year-end call. If the deal goes beyond the year-end call, then certainly we would expect to provide that update then. But again, if the deal closes prior to the call, I think you could expect it in concert with the deal announcement and coming out with a news story, post-deal. So T versus D versus other transmissions -- well, first of all, we think as long as the capital deployment serves our customers well and is providing value to our customers, we think that's a good use of capital across all of the business segments. The returns are still strong in all 3, are really in transmission and distribution, but also generation down in Kentucky, as well as gas. But transmission still has slightly higher ROEs than distribution. But again, we're not strained from an ability to finance capital perspective. So it's not like we're deciding whether we're going to do transmission versus distribution. No. Sure. Thanks, Julien. Hey, Paul. We do not. The division has not yet put out the procedural schedule, Paul. So you're not missing it. Sure. So the -- it's not all going in the Elevate Fund, it is across multiple funds that are driving really the -- some of the funds are focused on the utility of the future and innovation in that space, smart technologies, and others. They're focused on decarbonization technologies, so EVs or energy storage or things like that. So really it cuts across multiple funds within the EIP platform. And from our perspective, the benefit of that, Paul, is that we get -- I mean, not only has EIP demonstrated positive returns in the fund, which takes what traditionally would be a cost center for a Company with R&D efforts, and potentially turn that into neutral to a positive return. But really the strategic value of getting in there is that we get broad feet so we have visibility into the technologies that are emerging in all of these different areas, as we think about the potential for demonstration projects, or just where we think the next breakthrough in technology will come.  Whether that's on carbon capture or energy storage when you have long-duration storage technologies. Various different areas that we're looking at, as we think about getting to net-zero for not only the fleet but economy-wide. Well, I would say that EIP is part of it. I wouldn't say it's necessarily the primary R&D avenue, but certainly, it's part of our strategy there. You talked about EPRI and the Low-Carbon Resources Initiative. So I have just recently taken over the Board Working Group Chair role for EPRI, and so we're integrally involved with the expert team in EPRI and looking at various different technologies. Again, as it relates to carbon capture, new nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, all different types of decarbonization technology. Again, EPRI is focused on, what are the technological breakthroughs or the emerging technologies that are currently being looked at, but they're also assessing alternatives to those, and then identifying demonstration projects down the road to try to commercialize some of these newer technologies. And so we are actively engaged with them on all of that depending on how those things evolve, whether it's hydrogen for storage or even hydrogen blending for gas LVCs or combined cycle generation. There's a way to go, I think to prove all that out for hydrogen, but there's a lot of work and a lot of activity going on there. Carbon capture sequestration continues to be an area, again about 80% of the world's energy is coming from fossil fuels still, so for the globe to get to net-zero at some point, we think carbon capture will have to play a role in that, and so EPRI is spending some time on that as well. Again, nuclear, looking at different forms of nuclear modular unitso[, etc, could also play a role by making those units smaller and more adaptable. So a lot of things going on there, Paul, and I think we're -- our strategy is to make sure that we keep our finger on the pulse there. Again, we'll be retiring coal plants this decade and next. And so could there be potential opportunities for demonstration projects on some of those plants? We'll work with the state to see if there are opportunities there, as we think about again, Trimble County 2, which went into service in 2011. And so unless things change at the federal level where that plant will be forced to be shut, Our current projection is that it would continue to be economic in 2015, and so identifying these technological advancements to drive specifically that plant to net-zero. But again, you're going to have combined-cycle fleets that are part of the transition strategy that you've heard from me and many of my -- Yes, I think so, certainly in the near term. Sure. Sure. So I think, maybe I'll answer your second question first. We don't want to put an artificial timeline on the use of the proceeds. So the first step I think is getting through the detailed process of identifying the organic growth opportunities and putting those plans together, and to your point, when do they get staged in, in terms of '22 maybe versus potential feeding into the back part of the five-year plan and then even beyond that. So I would just say the first step is to get through that, and then we'll assess the timing of when that cash is needed, and then see exactly how much is really fitting into the scenario that you're talking about. In terms of the mechanisms, while we're staying out, first of all, I would just say that, again, in Pennsylvania, we've been very successful at growing our rate base and our earnings despite staying out of rate cases, and we haven't had a distribution rate case since January 1st of 2016. But over that time, and again, this is just distribution, we've grown our rate base 6%, 7% CAGR over that time period, and our net income CAGR has pretty much stayed in line with that rate base growth and the way that you're able to do that is obviously, we have some mechanisms within the different jurisdictions that reduce regulatory lag, whether it's the in PA or the ECR, the gas line tracker in Kentucky, of course, we have some in Rhode Island as well, around capital planning. But also when you deploy the capital in many cases you will see operational efficiencies as a result, and so those operational efficiencies can drive a return on that capital even though you're staying out of rate cases. So I will say that our -- we don't think the right answer just because we're staying out of rate cases is not to invest in the networks. It's incredibly important that we continue to reinvest in the networks, and then making sure that we do that in a way that drives efficiency for the customers and drives the return while we are staying out. We have the experience and successfully done that in Pennsylvania, so we'll look to replicate that. But just because we're staying put, we don't think that that means that there won't be a rate base or earnings growth opportunity. Sure. Great. Thanks to everybody for your participation, thanks for your questions. Everybody has a great day and look forward to the next time we get together. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Joseph Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you Vince, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 10. Today we announce Second Quarter reported earnings of $0.03 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a UK tax rate change, and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by earnings from the UK utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations. I'll note that the tax-related item was a non-cash adjustment before the completion of the sale of WPD in June. Adjusting for these special items, the second-quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.19 per share compared with $0.20 per share a year ago. We remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our Pennsylvania and Kentucky jurisdictions, which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales. These higher sales were offset by several factors, which I will cover in the next slide. Let's move to Slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second quarter segment results. As a reminder, we've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amounts to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the UK regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense. The total amount of these costs was about $0.02 per share for the Quarter. Turning to the ongoing segment results. Our Pennsylvania regulated segment results were $0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins, driven by lower peak transmission demand as discussed in Q1 and consistent with our expectations, and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission-based return on equity. Partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments. We also experienced an additional $0.01 decline due to favorable tax-related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment, results were $0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in Q2 2020. The increase was primarily driven by higher commercial industrial demand revenue as we experience strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of COVID-19 and lower interest expense primarily due to the interest cost previously allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in corporate and other. Partially offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were flat compared with a year ago. Higher interest costs of a penny, a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the Kentucky segment, were offset by several factors that were not individually significant. Turning to Slide 12, I'll cover some notable financing-related updates. First, following the sale of the UK utility business, we successfully completed a series of financing activities in June and July that led to a significant reduction in Holding Company debt. The result was a total reduction of PPL Capital Funding debt by about $3.5 billion, which was in line with our previously discussed targets. Through these actions, we've reduced total Holding Company debt to about 20% of PPL's total outstanding debt, while effectively clearing all near-term maturities at PPL Capital Funding through 2025. We've provided a detailed breakdown of these actions in the appendix of today's presentation. In addition to the activity at PPL Capital Funding, we redeemed at par $250 million at LG&E and KU energy in July, which was part of our original financing plan for the year to simplify the capital structure of the Company by eliminating intermediate holding Company debt. That was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the LKE entity. Therefore, we have deregistered LKE as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity. We expect PPL capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding Company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries. The successful execution of liability management leaves PPL well-positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post-closing of the Narragansett Electric acquisition. In addition to these notable financing updates, we also reduced outstanding short-term debt as efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of WPD. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. That's right. And the buyback subject, yes. So after the -- Right. Including liability management. Right. Sure."

I'll share a few operational highlights as well as an update on the 2 strategic transactions we announced in March.  Joe will provide a more detailed overview of first quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced the first quarter reported net loss of $2.39 per share. This reflects special item net losses of $2.67 per share, primarily related to reporting WPD's discontinued operations this quarter.  Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share compared with $0.27 per share a year ago. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Compared to last year, improved margins were the most significant driver of the increase, primarily due to more favorable weather compared to the mild winter we experienced in 2020.  Shifting to a few operational highlights. Now over a year into the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that operationally, all 7 of our utilities continue to perform extremely well with no operational issues to report. We continue to operate in a very similar manner to last year with many of our team members continuing to work from home.  We continue to stress the importance of social distancing and mask wearing within our facilities and at our work site. With vaccinations in full swing, we are beginning to turn our attention to return to office planning and protocols. However, we are not expecting to deviate from our current mode of operations for at least a few more months and perhaps until end of summer for some of our locations.  We've been able to operate extremely well during this virtual working environment, as evidenced not only by our strong operational performance, but also our ability to execute 2 significant strategic transactions simultaneously in a fully virtual manner. Our #1 priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and our customers, so we will be very diligent in our return-to-office planning.  Moving to an update on the Kentucky rate case proceedings. We reached unanimous settlement agreements subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval with all parties in our rate reviews for both LG&E and KU. The agreements cover all matters in the review except for net metering. We have a long track record of working constructively with the parties to our rate reviews to achieve positive outcomes that balance the interest of all our stakeholders, and this time was no exception.  The settlement agreements were filed with the KPSC on April 19, and hearings were held last week. We expect KPSC orders on all settled matters by June 30 with new rates effective July 1. I'll review the terms of the settlement agreements in a bit more detail on the next slide.  Moving to Pennsylvania. PPL Electric Utilities recently received the 2021 Energy Star Partner of the Year award from the EPA and Department of Energy. This award recognizes outstanding corporate energy management programs and is the EPA's highest level of recognition. It reflects PPL's commitment to protecting the environment and helping customers save energy and money.  In April, we also made a number of leadership changes to help further position the company for long-term success, especially as we plan for the integration of Narragansett Electric into the PPL family of regulated utilities. Greg Dudkin was promoted to Chief Operating Officer of PPL from his prior role as President of PPL Electric Utilities.  Under Greg's leadership over the past decade, PPL Electric Utilities has been focused squarely on creating the utility of the future. The business has developed one of the nation's most advanced electricity networks has consistently delivered award-winning customer satisfaction and has firmly established itself as an industry leader in reliability.  This advanced grid that we've built at PPL Electric Utilities uniquely positions us to partner with the state of Rhode Island in support of their ambitious decarbonization goals of net zero by 2050, and potentially driving toward 100% renewable energy by 2030. We continue to be very excited about the opportunity to bring our experience and expertise to an already very strong utility in Narragansett Electric. Greg will also focus on driving continuous improvement and best practices across our already strong regulated utility operations.  Stephanie Raymond is succeeding Greg as the President of PPL Electric Utilities. Stephanie has been a key member of PPL electric utilities leadership team for nearly a decade and has led both the transmission and distribution functions. She has played a central role in spearheading our operational excellence in Pennsylvania, as well as our forward-looking investments to strengthen grid resilience and prepare for increased distributed energy resources.  Our Pennsylvania customers are in very good hands with Stephanie now at the helm of PPL Electric Utilities. We also hired Wendy Stark as our new Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Wendy replaces Joanne Raphael, who announced her retirement from the company effective June 1 after an impressive and distinguished 35-year career with our company. We certainly wish Joanne all the best as she transitions to this new phase of her life. Wendy joins PPL from Pepco Holdings, where she served as Senior Vice President, Legal and Regulatory Strategy and General Counsel.  Wendy is an excellent addition to our team, and she's already making her presence known as we prepare for the regulatory approval process for the Narragansett acquisition. She brings to PPL significant experience in leading legal teams and extensive background in regulatory matters and a deep knowledge of our industry. I'm very excited about the strong leadership team that we've assembled here at PPL.  I believe it's the right team at the right time as we strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth in success. Finally, I'll note that we continue to make good progress on the regulatory approval processes. Related to both the WPD sale and the Narragansett acquisition. In the U.K., we remain on track to close the WPD sale by the end of July. On April 22, National Grid shareowners voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction.  And on May 4, we received the Guernsey approval, leaving just the financial conduct authority approval outstanding in the U.K. while we have no assurance as to the timing of this final approval, the WPD sale could close as early as this month. In the U.S., we've made all the required regulatory filings to secure approval for the Narragansett Electric acquisition.  We've requested the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers to decide on our petition by November 1, 2021. While we cannot be assured, the division will decide on our petition in that time frame, we remain confident in our ability to close on the acquisition by March of next year. The transition teams for both PPL and National Grid have been formed. And have actively begun planning to ensure a seamless transition for both employees and Rhode Island customers upon the approval and closing of the transaction.  The PPL transition team is being led by Greg Dudkin, with strong executive presence and experienced leaders on the team, who will oversee the eventual integration of Narragansett Electric into PPL. I'll also note that we've had very constructive discussions with public officials in Rhode Island since our announcement. These interactions have only strengthened my belief that PPL is well positioned to drive real value for Rhode Island customers in their communities and to play a key role in helping the state achieve its ambitious decarbonization goals.  Turning to Slide 5 in a bit more detail on the settlement agreements in Kentucky. We believe the agreements, which again require approval of the KPSC, represent constructive outcomes for all stakeholders and that they minimize the near-term rate impact on customers while still providing LG&E and KU the opportunity to recover their costs by providing safe and reliable service. The settlements proposed a combined revenue increase of $217 million for LG&E KU with an allowed base ROE of 9.55%. These revenue increases enable LG&E and KU to continue modernizing the grid, strengthening grid resilience and upgrading LG&E's natural gas system to enhance safety and reliability.  They include LG&E and KU'S proposed $53 million economic release store credit to help mitigate the impact of the rate adjustments until mid-2022. The stipulation reflects the continuation of the currently approved depreciation rates for Mill Creek Units 1 and 2 and Brown Unit 3 for rate making purposes, rather than using the depreciation rates proposed in our original applications.  We had initially requested the depreciation rates for these units to be updated with their expected retirement over the next decade as they reach the end of their economic useful lives. This adjustment reduces the requested revenue increases by approximately $70 million. In a related provision, the settlement agreements also proposed the establishment of a retired asset recovery rider to provide recovery of and on the remaining net book values of retired generation assets as well as associated inventory and decommissioning costs.  The writer would provide recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement, as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital. As we announced in January, Mill Creek Unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024. And Mill Creek Unit 2 and E.W. Brown Unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives.  These units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity. The settlements also proposed full deployment of advanced metering infrastructure, I'll note that the capital cost of the proposed AMI investment is not included in the revenue requirements in these rate cases. We'll record our investment in the AMI project as [indiscernible] and a crew AFUDC during the AMI implementation period.  And finally, the settlement agreements include commitments that LG&E and KU will not increase base rates for at least 4 years, subject to certain exceptions. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for a detailed overview of our first quarter financial results. Joe?\nJoseph Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. And with the U.K. now reflected as discontinued operations, we removed the U.K. Regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk. In connection with this change, we have also updated our ongoing segment presentation for certain items. First, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense.  The total amount of these costs was about $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, beginning with our 2021 results, corporate level financing costs will no longer be allocated for segment reporting purposes. Those costs were primarily related to the acquisition financing of the Kentucky Regulated segment and will also be reflected in corporate and other moving forward.  Now turning to the domestic segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were flat compared to a year ago. During the first quarter, we experienced higher distribution adjusted gross margins resulting primarily from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather compared to the prior year, a year in which we experienced a mild winter. Weather in Pennsylvania was essentially flat to our forecast for Q1 2021, with quarterly heating degree days slightly below normal conditions. Adjusted gross margins related to transmission were slightly lower for the first quarter.  Returns on additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission demand and a reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission formula rate return on equity. Settlement negotiations related to the challenge are currently proceeding, but there can be no assurance that they will result in a final settlement. Finally, we experienced lower O&M expense of about $0.01 per share in Pennsylvania during the first quarter compared to 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q1 2020.  The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather, and similar to Pennsylvania, weather was flat compared to our forecast. Partially offsetting the increase from higher sales was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher interest expense from the additional debt we issued at the start of the pandemic to ensure we had adequate liquidity to navigate the uncertainty.  We expect our interest expense to be reduced significantly after we complete the liability management following the closing of the WPD sale. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In summary, we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely and reliably for our customers during the pandemic. We're on pace to close our strategic transactions within the expected time frames while making good progress on the integration and transition planning for Narragansett Electric. And we remain very excited about the opportunity we have in front of us to reposition PPL for future growth and success. With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: And congrats on continued progress on the transaction. So first off, if you can, can you talk a little bit more as to how you think about the trajectory of Rhode Island here? I mean, obviously, you've got a clean energy mandate in that state. I know we're still early. I know you filed related documents here recently. But can you speak at least a little bit more to how you're initially thinking about this clean energy mandate? I know last time we spoke about this initially, any updated thoughts? And that reconciles against the, shall we say, historical rate base [indiscernible]?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. You cut out a little bit throughout that, but I think your question was how are we thinking about Rhode Island trajectory given the clean energy mandate there. So yes, the state has enacted a net zero by 2050 goal through Executive Board or with the prior governor had aspirations for a 100% renewable generation by 2030. That's the executive order, not legislation. However, we feel very positive and very comfortable about the opportunity in front of us to partner with the state to really help them reposition that great to be ready for those ambitious goals.  And we -- in our conversations, we've had many conversations with public officials up there around what our value proposition is to the state and why we think we're uniquely positioned to own these assets at this point in time. And to your point, Julien, I think what we've been able to create in Pennsylvania with -- we use the term grid of the future, utility of the future, with the automation and really having that grid setup for distributed energy resources and being able to not only be able to connect significantly more renewable energy behind-the-meter renewable energy, but to also to be able to have the insight and the ability to control those resources to ensure we can maintain power quality and stability of the grid.  And so as we've been talking with the constituents in Rhode Island, we've been stressing that we've already built a lot of what they are going to need to achieve those objectives. And obviously, doing it the second time is easier and faster than doing it the first time. And so we think there's an incredible opportunity not only to support their 2050 ambitions, but their 2030 ambitions, I think, are potentially achievable as well given what to do in Pennsylvania and our confidence in our ability to replicate that and [indiscernible].  So to your earlier point, and you mentioned a little bit here, your question, we need to -- obviously, we talked about that in our petition. And we've been very open in our discussions with the commission and the division as well as just some of the public officials. But to your point, we need to close on the transaction and then really work on the capital investment plans with both the division and the commission up there, demonstrate what we've done. We'll be doing that through the petition process, I'm sure, through [indiscernible] and testimonies.  And so we look forward to engaging with the constituents in Rhode Island to demonstrate our ability there. But to your point, we absolutely see that as an opportunity for us. But as importantly for the state of Rhode Island.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Indeed. And if I can follow-up on a question on acquisitions here in brief. Obviously, we've seen a number of transactions across the space, probably higher valuations than perhaps one would have expected a few months ago. Does that put pause at all with respect to your strategy, especially as you think about competing against infrastructure funds, et cetera, here? Just any open commentary you might provide to differentiate your strategy might be helpful, I think.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. I don't think we have much in terms of further details to talk about versus what we talked about in March when we announced the transactions, we do continue to explore various options for the best use of the remaining proceeds we will certainly update the market at the appropriate time when we make a decision on that. In terms of M&A, that's one of the options that we will look at.  We continuously look at M&A opportunities, as you know. I think our track record has demonstrated a disciplined approach there. Including the 2 transactions that we did with National Grid, both on the valuation we got for WPD, but the valuation that we paid for arrogance and both of those demonstrate a lot more discipline. And so we will continue that disciplined approach as we look at potential strategic acquisitions with the remaining use of proceeds.  But there's also opportunities that we're looking at for, potentially, further investments in the utility. We talked about the opportunity in Rhode Island, but we'll also continue to look at those opportunities in Pennsylvania and Kentucky additional investments in renewables. We talked about that in March as well. I think when you look at the Biden's plans, both infrastructure plan and the clean energy plan, that will certainly continue to be a tailwind for renewable investment, and we think we're poised very well to take advantage of that with our distributed energy resource group.  And then potentially share buybacks could be, again, the use of those proceeds, but we'll -- again, that kind of creates the base case that will look at these other opportunities. And I'll just stress, Julien that we'll continue to be disciplined in that analysis and work with the Board on those various options. And then, of course, we'll update the market when we make but I think the key for us is maintaining that level of discipline, which I think we've demonstrated a track record.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Just to sort of follow-up on Julien's question with respect to Narragansett, is it the case that you guys feel that, I guess, rate base growth will pretty much be on the same trajectory that it has been historically there? Or do you think it might increase [indiscernible] or change?\nVincent Sorgi: Well, again, Paul, I think -- we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of putting those investment plans together after we make the acquisition, we do certainly think there's potential opportunity to deploy more capital than what was being spent previously, especially if the state launched to meet some of those more aggressive targets in that '20, '30, '35 time frame. And then the challenge for us, which, again, we think we're up to the challenge, but what we'll have to do is work with the Division and the Commission to show a path to make that investment in a way that remains affordability for the state, and that would likely come from being more efficient on the O&M side that would enable that investment without necessarily driving up customer rates significantly.  So that's the opportunity, Paul, to be honest. And we just need to work through the details with both the Division and the Commission in the state once we pose the deal.\nPaul Patterson: I got you. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. So just moving up to the -- just on transmission and the comments that Joe made. Just could you elaborate a little bit further on this lower peak transmission demand? And how much -- can you just sort of give us a sense as to how much that was versus the reserve that you that you're booking as a result of the challenge on the ROE? And then just in association with that challenge or the negotiations associated with it, is -- has there been a discernible impact associated with the FERC's NOPR on the RTO ladder? I'm just wondering if that's had any impact on -- if that caused any uncertainty or issues with expected negotiations, if you follow me?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Maybe I'll answer the last part, and then I'll ask Joe just to cover the details on the P&L variance between the 2 components for transmission. But on the on the negotiations, Paul, I don't think there's anything discernible regarding the NOPR. We and the intervenors or the counterparties, we've been negotiating in good faith all the way through. I think it's been fairly constructive. And so that continues. And again, as Joe said, that there can be no assurance that these negotiations will result in a settlement, but -- but both parties are -- I feel very comfortable that we are both negotiating in good faith. And I don't necessarily see that the NOPR has really impacted those negotiations at this point. But Joe, do you want to cover the breakup -- the breakdown of the transmission [indiscernible]?\nJoseph Bergstein: Sure. So the lower peak transmission demand was about $0.02 per share for the quarter. And then for the reserve that we recorded, it was in total about $19 million after tax. $5 million of that was related to this year and $14 million of that was related to 2020. So it's about $0.01 -- that $5 million is about $0.01 for the quarter.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Today's next question comes from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: I guess, one, given that you still have a lot of potential money to be put to work, one strategic question. How willing are you to add more coal to your mix as part of any strategic option as you look out there?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Our willingness to add more coal to the portfolio, we really, I think, depend on the specific asset, Steve, and whether or not there's a clear transition plan for those coal assets. We are very mindful of our ESG profile. So that would certainly be something that we would take into consideration, both from management and the Board as we evaluate any particular M&A transaction, it would be our ESG profile. So but I would say that's probably very asset specific, whether or not we would be willing to take on more coal.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for your final remarks.\nVincent Sorgi: Great. Thanks again for joining us on our first quarter call, and everybody, have a great day. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

And we've been very open in our discussions with the commission and the division as well as just some of the public officials. But to your point, we need to close on the transaction and then really work on the capital investment plans with both the division and the commission up there, demonstrate what we've done. We'll be doing that through the petition process, I'm sure, through [indiscernible] and testimonies.  And so we look forward to engaging with the constituents in Rhode Island to demonstrate our ability there. But to your point, we absolutely see that as an opportunity for us. But as importantly for the state of Rhode Island. Yes. I don't think we have much in terms of further details to talk about versus what we talked about in March when we announced the transactions, we do continue to explore various options for the best use of the remaining proceeds we will certainly update the market at the appropriate time when we make a decision on that. In terms of M&A, that's one of the options that we will look at.  We continuously look at M&A opportunities, as you know. I think our track record has demonstrated a disciplined approach there. Including the 2 transactions that we did with National Grid, both on the valuation we got for WPD, but the valuation that we paid for arrogance and both of those demonstrate a lot more discipline. And so we will continue that disciplined approach as we look at potential strategic acquisitions with the remaining use of proceeds.  But there's also opportunities that we're looking at for, potentially, further investments in the utility. We talked about the opportunity in Rhode Island, but we'll also continue to look at those opportunities in Pennsylvania and Kentucky additional investments in renewables. We talked about that in March as well. I think when you look at the Biden's plans, both infrastructure plan and the clean energy plan, that will certainly continue to be a tailwind for renewable investment, and we think we're poised very well to take advantage of that with our distributed energy resource group.  And then potentially share buybacks could be, again, the use of those proceeds, but we'll -- again, that kind of creates the base case that will look at these other opportunities. And I'll just stress, Julien that we'll continue to be disciplined in that analysis and work with the Board on those various options. And then, of course, we'll update the market when we make but I think the key for us is maintaining that level of discipline, which I think we've demonstrated a track record. Well, again, Paul, I think -- we certainly don't want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of putting those investment plans together after we make the acquisition, we do certainly think there's potential opportunity to deploy more capital than what was being spent previously, especially if the state launched to meet some of those more aggressive targets in that '20, '30, '35 time frame. And then the challenge for us, which, again, we think we're up to the challenge, but what we'll have to do is work with the Division and the Commission to show a path to make that investment in a way that remains affordability for the state, and that would likely come from being more efficient on the O&M side that would enable that investment without necessarily driving up customer rates significantly.  So that's the opportunity, Paul, to be honest. And we just need to work through the details with both the Division and the Commission in the state once we pose the deal. Yes. Maybe I'll answer the last part, and then I'll ask Joe just to cover the details on the P&L variance between the 2 components for transmission. But on the on the negotiations, Paul, I don't think there's anything discernible regarding the NOPR. We and the intervenors or the counterparties, we've been negotiating in good faith all the way through. I think it's been fairly constructive. And so that continues. And again, as Joe said, that there can be no assurance that these negotiations will result in a settlement, but -- but both parties are -- I feel very comfortable that we are both negotiating in good faith. And I don't necessarily see that the NOPR has really impacted those negotiations at this point. But Joe, do you want to cover the breakup -- the breakdown of the transmission [indiscernible]? Yes. Our willingness to add more coal to the portfolio, we really, I think, depend on the specific asset, Steve, and whether or not there's a clear transition plan for those coal assets. We are very mindful of our ESG profile. So that would certainly be something that we would take into consideration, both from management and the Board as we evaluate any particular M&A transaction, it would be our ESG profile. So but I would say that's probably very asset specific, whether or not we would be willing to take on more coal. Great. Thanks again for joining us on our first quarter call, and everybody, have a great day. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Joseph Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. And with the U.K. now reflected as discontinued operations, we removed the U.K. Regulated segment from our quarterly earnings walk. In connection with this change, we have also updated our ongoing segment presentation for certain items. First, we have adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the U.K. Regulated segment, which was primarily interest expense.  The total amount of these costs was about $0.01 per share for the quarter. In addition, beginning with our 2021 results, corporate level financing costs will no longer be allocated for segment reporting purposes. Those costs were primarily related to the acquisition financing of the Kentucky Regulated segment and will also be reflected in corporate and other moving forward.  Now turning to the domestic segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results were flat compared to a year ago. During the first quarter, we experienced higher distribution adjusted gross margins resulting primarily from higher sales volumes due to favorable weather compared to the prior year, a year in which we experienced a mild winter. Weather in Pennsylvania was essentially flat to our forecast for Q1 2021, with quarterly heating degree days slightly below normal conditions. Adjusted gross margins related to transmission were slightly lower for the first quarter.  Returns on additional capital investments were offset by lower peak transmission demand and a reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission formula rate return on equity. Settlement negotiations related to the challenge are currently proceeding, but there can be no assurance that they will result in a final settlement. Finally, we experienced lower O&M expense of about $0.01 per share in Pennsylvania during the first quarter compared to 2020. Turning to our Kentucky Regulated segment. Results were $0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in Q1 2020.  The increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather, and similar to Pennsylvania, weather was flat compared to our forecast. Partially offsetting the increase from higher sales was higher operation and maintenance expense, primarily at our generation plants. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to a year ago, driven primarily by higher interest expense from the additional debt we issued at the start of the pandemic to ensure we had adequate liquidity to navigate the uncertainty.  We expect our interest expense to be reduced significantly after we complete the liability management following the closing of the WPD sale. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Sure. So the lower peak transmission demand was about $0.02 per share for the quarter. And then for the reserve that we recorded, it was in total about $19 million after tax. $5 million of that was related to this year and $14 million of that was related to 2020. So it's about $0.01 -- that $5 million is about $0.01 for the quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and welcome to the PPL Corporation Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on fourth quarter and year end 2022 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we'll conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to slide two and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end investor update. We'll keep our remarks brief this morning given the comprehensive update we shared with you on January 11th. We continue to be extremely excited for PPL's bright future and the value we intend to deliver for our customers and shareowners. Turning to slide four, 2022 was a remarkable year in PPL's history, one that has completely redefined our company. It marks the beginning of a new era as we are now positioned as a premier pure-play US regulated utility holding company. Our strategic repositioning began with the sale of our UK business in 2021 and concluded in May of 2022 with the addition of Rhode Island Energy and its almost 800,000 customers. I'm very proud of the execution from our team to close this transaction and complete the transition activities to-date with National Grid. We are on schedule to complete all of the TSAs in 2024 as originally planned. The acquisition of Rhode Island Energy also enhances our scale and enables PPL to be a leader in our sector for years to come. This includes positioning our company to deliver top-tier 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth through at least 2026, with one of the best credit profiles in our sector, our balance sheet can support our growth without equity issuances throughout the planning horizon. And while we executed on our strategic repositioning, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of delivering excellent financial and operational results in 2022. First and foremost, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the midpoint of our forecast, which we had increased in November. This is a fantastic accomplishment considering all the extra work our teams completed this past year in connection with our strategic repositioning. In addition to delivering solid financial results, we also laid the groundwork for capital investments we need to make for years to come, in our pursuit of delivering an exceptional customer experience at an affordable price. Specifically, we presented a balanced investment plan in Kentucky to replace nearly 1,500 megawatts of retiring coal generation. This plan best positions our utilities in Kentucky to serve our customers with safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy while the state fosters significant economic development and growth. We also designed a series of plans for our newly acquired Rhode Island Energy, strategies to deliver the energy grids necessary to achieve the state's impressive clean energy goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033. These plans include advanced metering, grid modernization and our first infrastructure safety and reliability plans under our ownership. These plans emphasize just some of the robust investment opportunities at our utilities. We're also looking at potential regulated investment opportunities beyond our four utilities, leveraging our expertise in transmission development to open new doors for potential growth. This includes our strategic partnership with WindGrid, an Elia subsidiary, where we are exploring offshore transmission solutions in New England. Any investment opportunity stemming from this partnership, are not included in our capital forecast and represent potential upside to our long-term growth plan. On the operational front, during 2022, we maintained our top quartile reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, despite the increased frequency and severity of storms in our service territories. And in just a few months of ownership, Rhode Island Energy has experienced a marked improvement in reliability and exceeded 2022 expectations by more than 10%. One example of this excellent performance was during Winter Storm Elliott. Rhode Island Energy was the first major New England utility to achieve full customer restoration in the early morning of Christmas Day. We also maintained our top quartile customer satisfaction at PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities. And while we're proud of these achievements, we are sympathetic to the concerns of our Pennsylvania customers who experienced increases in their December bills as a result of higher energy prices. While we don't control the price of electricity supply, we know that it can have a meaningful impact on our customers. And while the default rate for PPL Electric's non-shopping customers increased in December, many of our customers who have chosen third-party suppliers saw even higher price increases and are paying significantly more than our default rate of approximately $0.145. Our most recent review of shopping results found that in November, over 40% of our residential shopping customers paid a higher rate than our default rate. Over 100,000 customers paid a rate between 25% and 100% more than the default rate and nearly 20,000 customers paid more than double our default rate. For the last two years, PPL Electric has been a vocal advocate, on behalf of our customers, for greater safeguards and other actions to protect them from overpaying for their electricity supply. We proposed various consumer protection reforms with our Pennsylvania legislators and regulators and are again having discussions with them for the benefit of our customers. In addition to higher bills from these increased energy prices, a large number of our PPL Electric Utilities customers received estimated bills in December due to a technical issue. The timing of higher electricity bills and the increased number of estimated bills created some confusion and concern for customers. We have since fixed the technical issue and have temporarily doubled the resources at our call centers to address customer questions and significantly reduce call wait times. And in further support of our customers, we've waived late fees and expanded our no-shutoff practice over the winter to include all residential and small business customers. We're also focused on communicating even more with our customers about high energy prices and what customers can do to minimize their energy bills. While this is an important topic for us and our customers that I wanted to address today, I want to be clear that we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on our financial results. As we've discussed at length, one of the key aspects of our strategy is to drive operating efficiencies across the entire business. In developing our strategy, we anticipated affordability being a key area of focus for customers and regulators, even before we saw the effects of inflation and high commodity costs. We all know the energy grids need significant investment to ensure reliability and resiliency while preparing for renewables, DERs and more electrification. This is why our plan best positions PPL to achieve our goals while focusing on affordability for our customers. Turning to Slide 5. PPL's outlook for 2023 is one that is simply focused on executing our utility of the future strategy. In my 2022 recap, I discussed that we are on track with our integration activities with Rhode Island Energy. An obvious top priority for 2023 is to remain on track with our Rhode Island integration, setting us up for completion in 2024. We have a $2.4 billion capital plan that improves the safety, reliability and resiliency of our networks while addressing our customers' evolving needs. We're on track to deliver the first leg of our $175 million O&M savings target by 2026 with $50 million to $60 million of savings in 2023 as we deploy our playbook and continue to optimize our operations. These savings will provide a strong basis for us to deliver the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. Recall, this forecast represents a 7% increase from our pro forma 2022 forecast of $1.48 per share. We will also focus on the regulatory filings in Kentucky and Rhode Island to deliver lease cost and reliable energy for our customers and help to advance the clean energy transition. Turning to Slide 6. As we executed our strategic repositioning over the past few years, we took a hard look at how we wanted to be defined as a company and management team. Simply put, we want to be the best utility company in the US, the best set of learning safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to our customers and competitive long-term returns to our shareowners. We've included on the right side of the slide, the categories that we'll use to measure our success against our peers. In short, we will be targeting top decile or top quartile performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and cost efficiency, while at the same time, targeting a premium stock valuation. While we're not there yet in all categories, I firmly believe we are on the right path to get there. And I'm excited to see us advance down this path. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. Our solid fourth quarter financial results closed out a great year for the company. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.02 per share, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, partially offset by a tax benefit due to the provision to final 2021 tax return adjustments, primarily related to the sale of WPD. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.06 per share compared to 2021. With these strong fourth quarter results, our 2022 GAAP earnings totaled $1.02 per share. Special items for the year were $0.39 per share, primarily related to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Our ongoing earnings for the year were $1.41 per share compared to $1.05 per share for 2021 exceeding the midpoint of our earnings forecast for 2022. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on slide nine. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to milder than normal weather last year and increased returns on additional capital investments in transmission. These improvements were offset partially by higher O&M expenses. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. Improved sales volumes in Kentucky also due to milder than normal weather experienced last year were more than offset by higher O&M and interest expense. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.03 per share for the quarter. Results at Corporate and Other increased $0.03 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expenses, lower income taxes, and other factors that were not individually significant. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter reflects another proof point of delivering on expectations since our repositioning last year. Our results for the full year are on slide 10. We reported improved results across each business segment in 2022. The operating segment results presented here exclude the impact of share accretion, which we've shown as a separate bar on the far right of the slide. Recall that we used a portion of the UK business sales proceeds to repurchase $1 billion of shares back in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in $0.05 of accretion in 2022. We also used another $4 billion of the UK sales proceeds to reduce our holding company debt, strengthening our balance sheet to one of the best in the sector. This reduction of debt was the primary driver for the $0.10 improvement in our Corporate and Other segment for the year. Turning to the operating segments. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment delivered a $0.06 per share increase for the year compared to 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher peak transmission demand, and improved sales volumes. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including increased uncollectibles, additional vegetation management costs, and IT amortization costs. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earnings increased by $0.07 per share for the year compared to 2021. Our improved results in Kentucky were primarily driven by a full year of higher retail rates that went into effect in July 2021 and higher sales volumes. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including vegetation management, plant outage and storm costs, and higher depreciation expense. Our Rhode Island segment added $0.08 per share to ongoing earnings for the year, reflecting the period from our acquisition in late May through the end of the year. This was a great year for the company and is yet another demonstration of our commitment to deliver on and exceed our financial goals. Turning to slide 11. We expect to keep that momentum heading into this year. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share and the midpoint of $1.58 per share. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our forecast by leveraging our proven operating model, a strategy focused on driving cost efficiencies to reduce O&M, which enables investments necessary to advance our energy networks in the most affordable manner. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.04 per share in 2023, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower O&M, partially offset by higher interest expense. We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.05 per share in 2023, primarily due to lower O&M, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.08 per share in 2023, primarily due to the impact of a full year's earnings. We project corporate and other results to be flat year-over-year. Moving to slide 12. In connection with the request from many of our investors, we've reallocated our Kentucky holding company financing costs to corporate and other, beginning January 1. This reallocation provides a clearer view of the utility earnings for our Kentucky Regulated segment and is consistent with how we report the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island segments. We've illustrated the impact of this reallocation to our actual 2022 ongoing earnings on this slide to show the 2022 segment results on a consistent basis with our 2023 segment forecast. Moving to slide 13. Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share to be paid on April 3 to shareholders of record as of March 10. As we discussed in January, the $0.24 dividend is a 7% increase that aligns with our predictable, linear and competitive annual EPS growth of 6% to 8%. This is also within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65%, combining our targeted EPS growth with our dividend yield provides investors with a compelling total return proposition in the range of 9% to 11% per year. This is consistent with our mission of delivering long-term returns to shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. Over the past two years, we've taken bold steps to transform PPL for long-term growth and success and to improve shareowner return, while building on our core strengths. Since then, we have continued to deliver on the goals we set, exceeding the midpoint of our 2022 earnings forecast, advancing industry-leading grid modernization, providing highly reliable electricity and gas service and economically advancing our clean energy strategy. And our plan provides investors with an attractive return proposition, one that the entire management team and I intend to deliver. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, team.\nVince Sorgi: Hey, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, Vince. Just two quick ones here after you guys obviously had a comprehensive update a little while ago. But just -- I know you guys are obviously targeting $50 million to $60 million of O&M savings this year, but it's been kind of a super mild winter, Q1 looks to be a little bit rough. I guess how comfortable are you around the 158 midpoint when you're also layering in sort of interest expense pressures and some of the externalities we're seeing out there. So I guess if the tail risks don't abate can you sort of pull forward some of that incremental $70 million in O&M savings next year into this year? I guess, can you just talk a little bit about the contingencies here? Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Shar. Look, I would just say we still remain incredibly confident in our ability to hit the 2023 forecast. As you've mentioned and with many of our peers, right, I would say the most significant potential headwinds or factors that we're looking at today are interest rates and inflation. And then, of course, weather, which you referenced and its impact potentially on sales or our storm costs. I would say regarding inflation and interest rates at this point, we're really not seeing anything significant enough that we don't think we can manage as we look forward for not only 2023 but going forward. And I would just reiterate that we built a plan to withstand volatile markets and still enable us to hit the targets that we've laid out for you all. So we're still very confident, don't necessarily see the need to really accelerate O&M, but that's always a lever we have at our disposal.\nShar Pourreza: Great. And then just lastly, Vince, that's helpful. Just on the Kentucky CPCN process, interveners are obviously starting to line up, looks like there's been some delays on solar PPAs and the PSC just engaged a consultant, right, to do an analysis earlier this week. Can you just speak to the process a little bit more broadly and what we should be watching for interveners and procedurally between now and your next update in the spring? Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes, sure. So the CPCN process does continue, I would say, really on plan as was laid out in the procedural schedule. Last week, the KPSC granted several interveners, their motions to intervene short, none of those were a surprise to us. So I would say everything, again, progressing as we would have expected there. The next step is for us to get the data requests from the interveners, which are due to us by the end of today actually. This will then start a series of requests and testimony that are scheduled really to continue through mid-August. And then once we get through that, that will culminate with the public hearing during the last week of August. And then as I think you know, the commission has indicated that they expect to provide a decision by November 6.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Terrific. Fantastic. That\u2019s all I had and congrats and we\u2019ll be seeing you real soon. Appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hey Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning. Good morning team. And Vince very helpful. Thank you for your commentary on the Pennsylvania billing issue, we were getting some questions on that, so I appreciate the color. I just had one quick follow-up, rest, everything is pretty clear. The -- you've asked for AFUDC in Kentucky, is that part of this CPCN filing, or is that a separate decision? What should we be looking for there and how to track that specifically?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, that will come out through the CPCN process, so that will be resolved all at the same time to get, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. And go Eagles for 2024.\nVince Sorgi: Not an Eagle stand, but that's okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hey Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Hey, how is it going? On the call, I think you were -- in your prepared remarks, you were talking about like discussions with regulators about affordability and what have you. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color as to what they might be looking at and if you have a little bit more discussion about Kentucky and I guess, Pennsylvania, what you're hearing there?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, some of the things that we were -- we've been engaged in Pennsylvania, really with our -- with the state legislature as well as our regulator, the PUC. Most significantly, Paul, we've requested to have customers return to the EDC, so right, the companies like PPL Electric and to return to our default rate when they come off the standard offer program as that's where we've seen our customers gauge the most when they come off the standard offer plan. In some cases, our customers' rates have increased by more than 300% in the months following, coming off the standard offer program. So, we -- our recommendation was just to have folks once the standard offer program ends. If they hadn't already signed up for a new plan that they would just default to our default rate, which would limit how much the price could increase as opposed to, like I said, this 300% or more, which we have seen some of our customers get it with. We've also requested that suppliers provide detailed information about their agreements to our customers, both to the electric companies. So, again, companies like PPL Electric as well as the PUC, so that we can augment any supplier notifications and make sure that our customers understand some of these plans that they're signing up for. We've also asked for tighter restrictions around introductory or teaser rates as well as variable rates. Again, our customers have been impacted significantly by some of those areas. So, overall, I would just say we're really trying to see greater accountability with our suppliers.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. This is kind of a problem that's sort of plagued choice -- retail choice jurisdictions around the country, I mean, if you look over the years, there are some places that are talking about actually limiting customer choice to more sophisticated customers. In other words, there just doesn't seem to be a lot of value that's being driven by these third-party providers in many cases. And is there any talk about that? And anywhere in any of the areas that you operate?\nVince Sorgi: I'm not seeing that yet, Paul. But again, so we've been engaged with our public officials over the last couple of years on trying to get some of these measures implemented, and they haven't to-date, we are continuing to engage with them. I think, it's more pronounced now with what we've seen with wholesale power prices and natural gas prices. So we will continue to engage on behalf of our customers to try to get these wholesale -- or not the wholesale rates, but the rates that third-party suppliers are charging our customers. In many cases, as I said in my prepared remarks, customers are paying a lot more, even more than double our default rate. And you can go out on the PUC's website and actually get prices that are even cheaper than our default rate. And so, it's a huge issue, as you mentioned, and that's why we're spending a lot of time right now on educating our customers to make sure that they know what plans are available, but also to just make sure they really read the fine print and understand the plans that they're entering into and doing what's best for them and their family.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much. Have a great one.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Please, go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hi, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Hi. How are you? So I have a question about Kentucky. And it's -- I understand it's a bit premature, I guess. But given the time line for the approval by FERC of the Kentucky Power sale, I think it's increasingly likely that, that transaction doesn't happen. And I'm just wondering, if this asset stays within AP, they're probably going to try to boost its growth profile, which -- that could result in additional coal plant retirements or plans to retire coal plants. And I'm just wondering, how do you think that could impact your pending proposal? I mean, we've been hearing some noise in newspapers in the state about reliability concerns on the back of coal plant retirements? And again, just thinking bigger picture if there were to be more large state utilities with a similar growth path or towards the coal plant retirements, if that could actually derail the process, or do you think actually that could be helpful?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, I'm not sure, I think, it would impact us one way or the other, Angie. I think, again, our CPCN has been designed to strike an appropriate balance with different fuel sources to provide that safe, reliable and affordable energy, while we're replacing 1,500 megawatts, that is reaching our end of lives. We've been very clear that we have not accelerated the retirement of our coal plants. These are plants that are end of life. And -- so our CP, or CPCN, with the commission is really how best to replace that retiring coal generation with the least cost, most reliable sources of energy. And as you know, we have a balance of combined cycle plants in there with solar, with some storage, et cetera. So I don't know that I would see the -- whether the sale process or whether the asset remains with AEP really impacting our process.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then secondly, assuming that you do get the approval, the certificate of -- the certificates from the Kentucky Commission, would you then file a rate case to recover the investment, or the plan would be either see a rider recovery or basically further cut costs to pay for the capital spending and the return on it? Yes. So we do -- we are requesting AFUDC coverage for the capital investments we would be making under the CPCN. So that would provide us with the earnings aspect of making those investments before they go in service. From a cash perspective, again, one of the reasons why we have the balance sheet that we have is it enables us to engage with our regulators to mitigate near-term rate impacts, but at the same time, get the investments done that we know we need to get done. And then we would pick that up in a rate case sometime in the 2026 or later time frame.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, this point that you brought up about retail choice. So it's kind of an interesting time, right? Because if you think -- I mean, I'm assuming that you guys had procured electricity ahead of time, so you had likely locked in elevated power prices. So wouldn't actually retail choice makes sense to residential customers in this power price environment where power prices have fallen pretty dramatically, as such that there should be a positive differential between what a retailer can offer versus what the incumbent utility offers, no?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, you would think so, Angie. So our price to compare is about $0.0145. There are suppliers out there that are below $0.10 exactly to your point. We've had to procure that power over six, 12, 18 months time horizons in accordance with the PUC process. So yes, so we're not necessarily getting the immediate impact of the precipitous decline in energy prices over the last month or two. Some of our suppliers are, which they're able to provide, like I said, $0.10 contracts, it makes it interesting that many of our customers were paying $0.20 and over $0.30 in December for their third-party supplier energy. So great point.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of minor questions here. I just wanted to check on the reallocation of the Kentucky Holdco drag, I was just wondering, are there any implications there either from a regulatory perspective or from like a debt refinancing perspective as you shift that into corporate and other, or is it really just as simple as moving around that EPS drag?\nJoe Bergstein: Hey, Dave, it's Joe. It's -- there's no implications to either of those. It's really just the reallocation of those costs that we were -- we had been allocating to the Kentucky segment to and really from an investor perspective to align the Kentucky segment to the similar way that we had been reporting Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. So no implications there.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. Great. That's helpful. And then I was just curious, would you expect any ongoing elevated costs or personnel activity or anything like that on the back of the billing issues in Pennsylvania in terms of the call center resources or anything like that, or is it going to be just temporary in terms of response there?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. No, that will be temporary, David. We do have third-party contracts that we can lean on in times of need, which we've done. We've also reallocated some of our existing folks in other departments and train them up on the call center activity. So, yes, of course, the third-party contracts, we could dial those up and down as needed and then our internal resources -- they'll just go back to their other departments when we're through with the call center duties that we have been doing.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, understood. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead.\nGreg Orrill: Yes, thank you. Just with regard to the CPCN, how does the impact of inflation play into that with inflation/supply constraints?\nVince Sorgi: So, those price estimates that are in our CPCN are all based on current pricing. And we ran the RFPs in the summertime. So, those RFP prices are included for solar projects. And again, we're using our internal cost estimates for the combined cycle units and any of the solar that we're proposing that we build. So, I would say cost estimates are up-to-date there. No major issues with having to adjust those with what's in the CPCN.\nGreg Orrill: All right. Congratulations.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo: And good to hear about the Rhode Island reliability improvements so quick off the bat. Shifting to the gas side in Rhode Island, I know there's that future of gas proceeding ongoing. Just could you talk at a high level how that could impact the spending plans, whether in terms of magnitude or timing?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, it's -- we're early in that process, Paul, as you know. We did put a capital plan together to ensure the safety and reliability of the gas network while we work with the state on the future of gas docket, that will take some time to get through. Again, as we think about the gas networks, not only in Rhode Island, but across the country. We certainly see a future for those as to folks like EPRI and other independent research agencies in terms of the fuel that's flowing through those LDCs may be different. They may not be 100% natural gas. could have renewable natural gas, hydrogen, we could have other sources of fuel flowing through them, but there are certain processes that just don't lend themselves to electrification. And so long-term, while we certainly support and expect there to be a lot more electrification, we also expect there to be a need and a use for gas LDC networks. And so making sure that those networks are safe and reliable now continues to be a top priority, but we will certainly be engaged with the state on the long-term future of that network.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, excellent. Thank you. And one unrelated and I know you may be a little limited in what you can say, but just is there any update on the talent litigation or arbitration now that, that bankruptcy process has wrapped up? I know it's a legacy one, but just hope we can put that one to bit bed sooner rather than later? Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. There is actually -- we are entering into mediation next week on February 22. That will be before one of the judges in the Texas bankruptcy court. So, yes, there is an update there. We'll be heading into mediation next week.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Thank you very much.\nVince Sorgi: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.\nNeil Kalton: Hi, guys. Just a question on Rhode Island. Yes. It looks like based on the guidance for 2023 that, if my math is right, it might not be, that you will be significantly under-earning the ROE. So my question is, are the cost savings coming in as expected thus far? And then, in terms of bridging that gap? Is this something that is ultimately going to require regulatory relief in 2026, or can it be accomplished faster?\nJoe Bergstein: Hey, Neil, it\u2019s Joe. So a couple of points there. First on the Rhode Island guidance for 2023. I think, we've discussed in the past a few times that we expect to experience some variability or noise in our Rhode Island earnings as we work through the transition period and stand up Rhode Island on our systems and processes. And so, that's what you're seeing here. The primary driver of those lower earnings are due to costs, as we work our way off the TSA, their costs such as staffing up our operations, training our new full-time employees, things like that. I do expect that to normalize once we've completed the TSA period in 2024. And again, we expected this from the outset, and it's been embedded in our projections. And so, our outlook for Rhode Island remains very positive, as we execute the plan, and I certainly expect to see growth there in 2024. As far as the O&M savings that we're projecting for 2023, the $50 million to $60 million, those come predominantly from Pennsylvania and Kentucky for the same reason I talked about in Rhode Island. We're still working our way off those TSAs. So until we're on our systems and processes, we can't really drive O&M savings there through the transition period.\nNeil Kalton: Okay. Understood. And do you think by 2025, we're going to be earning close to the allowed there, or is -- it might take a little bit more?\nJoe Bergstein: I think, 25% is certainly a normal year. We'll be off the TSAs by that period, sometime in 2024. So we get a clean year in 2025. It will have been some time since the last rate case there. I think National Grid's last rate case was 2018. So we certainly expect to see an improvement in ROEs. We may need a rate case following that. But I think we'll continue to work through the plan and execute what we have in store there and see where we are. But we feel -- again, we feel good about the growth prospects in Rhode Island.\nNeil Kalton: Got it. Thank you.\nJoe Bergstein: Yes.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I just want to reiterate, again, really pleased with our 2022 results where we ultimately came in, what we accomplished in 2022 to set us up for 2023 and beyond and just, really remain confident in our ability to deliver on what we've laid out for you all. And I can tell you the entire management team is aligned around the new strategy, and we're really looking forward to delivering it. So, with that, hopefully, we'll see you guys on some of the conference circuits or on MDRs and look forward to chatting with you then.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end investor update. We'll keep our remarks brief this morning given the comprehensive update we shared with you on January 11th. We continue to be extremely excited for PPL's bright future and the value we intend to deliver for our customers and shareowners. Turning to slide four, 2022 was a remarkable year in PPL's history, one that has completely redefined our company. It marks the beginning of a new era as we are now positioned as a premier pure-play US regulated utility holding company. Our strategic repositioning began with the sale of our UK business in 2021 and concluded in May of 2022 with the addition of Rhode Island Energy and its almost 800,000 customers. I'm very proud of the execution from our team to close this transaction and complete the transition activities to-date with National Grid. We are on schedule to complete all of the TSAs in 2024 as originally planned. The acquisition of Rhode Island Energy also enhances our scale and enables PPL to be a leader in our sector for years to come. This includes positioning our company to deliver top-tier 6% to 8% earnings and dividend growth through at least 2026, with one of the best credit profiles in our sector, our balance sheet can support our growth without equity issuances throughout the planning horizon. And while we executed on our strategic repositioning, we remain steadfast in our pursuit of delivering excellent financial and operational results in 2022. First and foremost, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the midpoint of our forecast, which we had increased in November. This is a fantastic accomplishment considering all the extra work our teams completed this past year in connection with our strategic repositioning. In addition to delivering solid financial results, we also laid the groundwork for capital investments we need to make for years to come, in our pursuit of delivering an exceptional customer experience at an affordable price. Specifically, we presented a balanced investment plan in Kentucky to replace nearly 1,500 megawatts of retiring coal generation. This plan best positions our utilities in Kentucky to serve our customers with safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy while the state fosters significant economic development and growth. We also designed a series of plans for our newly acquired Rhode Island Energy, strategies to deliver the energy grids necessary to achieve the state's impressive clean energy goal of 100% renewable energy by 2033. These plans include advanced metering, grid modernization and our first infrastructure safety and reliability plans under our ownership. These plans emphasize just some of the robust investment opportunities at our utilities. We're also looking at potential regulated investment opportunities beyond our four utilities, leveraging our expertise in transmission development to open new doors for potential growth. This includes our strategic partnership with WindGrid, an Elia subsidiary, where we are exploring offshore transmission solutions in New England. Any investment opportunity stemming from this partnership, are not included in our capital forecast and represent potential upside to our long-term growth plan. On the operational front, during 2022, we maintained our top quartile reliability in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, despite the increased frequency and severity of storms in our service territories. And in just a few months of ownership, Rhode Island Energy has experienced a marked improvement in reliability and exceeded 2022 expectations by more than 10%. One example of this excellent performance was during Winter Storm Elliott. Rhode Island Energy was the first major New England utility to achieve full customer restoration in the early morning of Christmas Day. We also maintained our top quartile customer satisfaction at PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities. And while we're proud of these achievements, we are sympathetic to the concerns of our Pennsylvania customers who experienced increases in their December bills as a result of higher energy prices. While we don't control the price of electricity supply, we know that it can have a meaningful impact on our customers. And while the default rate for PPL Electric's non-shopping customers increased in December, many of our customers who have chosen third-party suppliers saw even higher price increases and are paying significantly more than our default rate of approximately $0.145. Our most recent review of shopping results found that in November, over 40% of our residential shopping customers paid a higher rate than our default rate. Over 100,000 customers paid a rate between 25% and 100% more than the default rate and nearly 20,000 customers paid more than double our default rate. For the last two years, PPL Electric has been a vocal advocate, on behalf of our customers, for greater safeguards and other actions to protect them from overpaying for their electricity supply. We proposed various consumer protection reforms with our Pennsylvania legislators and regulators and are again having discussions with them for the benefit of our customers. In addition to higher bills from these increased energy prices, a large number of our PPL Electric Utilities customers received estimated bills in December due to a technical issue. The timing of higher electricity bills and the increased number of estimated bills created some confusion and concern for customers. We have since fixed the technical issue and have temporarily doubled the resources at our call centers to address customer questions and significantly reduce call wait times. And in further support of our customers, we've waived late fees and expanded our no-shutoff practice over the winter to include all residential and small business customers. We're also focused on communicating even more with our customers about high energy prices and what customers can do to minimize their energy bills. While this is an important topic for us and our customers that I wanted to address today, I want to be clear that we do not expect this matter to have a significant impact on our financial results. As we've discussed at length, one of the key aspects of our strategy is to drive operating efficiencies across the entire business. In developing our strategy, we anticipated affordability being a key area of focus for customers and regulators, even before we saw the effects of inflation and high commodity costs. We all know the energy grids need significant investment to ensure reliability and resiliency while preparing for renewables, DERs and more electrification. This is why our plan best positions PPL to achieve our goals while focusing on affordability for our customers. Turning to Slide 5. PPL's outlook for 2023 is one that is simply focused on executing our utility of the future strategy. In my 2022 recap, I discussed that we are on track with our integration activities with Rhode Island Energy. An obvious top priority for 2023 is to remain on track with our Rhode Island integration, setting us up for completion in 2024. We have a $2.4 billion capital plan that improves the safety, reliability and resiliency of our networks while addressing our customers' evolving needs. We're on track to deliver the first leg of our $175 million O&M savings target by 2026 with $50 million to $60 million of savings in 2023 as we deploy our playbook and continue to optimize our operations. These savings will provide a strong basis for us to deliver the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. Recall, this forecast represents a 7% increase from our pro forma 2022 forecast of $1.48 per share. We will also focus on the regulatory filings in Kentucky and Rhode Island to deliver lease cost and reliable energy for our customers and help to advance the clean energy transition. Turning to Slide 6. As we executed our strategic repositioning over the past few years, we took a hard look at how we wanted to be defined as a company and management team. Simply put, we want to be the best utility company in the US, the best set of learning safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy to our customers and competitive long-term returns to our shareowners. We've included on the right side of the slide, the categories that we'll use to measure our success against our peers. In short, we will be targeting top decile or top quartile performance and safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and cost efficiency, while at the same time, targeting a premium stock valuation. While we're not there yet in all categories, I firmly believe we are on the right path to get there. And I'm excited to see us advance down this path. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe? Thank you, Joe. Over the past two years, we've taken bold steps to transform PPL for long-term growth and success and to improve shareowner return, while building on our core strengths. Since then, we have continued to deliver on the goals we set, exceeding the midpoint of our 2022 earnings forecast, advancing industry-leading grid modernization, providing highly reliable electricity and gas service and economically advancing our clean energy strategy. And our plan provides investors with an attractive return proposition, one that the entire management team and I intend to deliver. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Hey, Shar. Yes, Shar. Look, I would just say we still remain incredibly confident in our ability to hit the 2023 forecast. As you've mentioned and with many of our peers, right, I would say the most significant potential headwinds or factors that we're looking at today are interest rates and inflation. And then, of course, weather, which you referenced and its impact potentially on sales or our storm costs. I would say regarding inflation and interest rates at this point, we're really not seeing anything significant enough that we don't think we can manage as we look forward for not only 2023 but going forward. And I would just reiterate that we built a plan to withstand volatile markets and still enable us to hit the targets that we've laid out for you all. So we're still very confident, don't necessarily see the need to really accelerate O&M, but that's always a lever we have at our disposal. Yes, sure. So the CPCN process does continue, I would say, really on plan as was laid out in the procedural schedule. Last week, the KPSC granted several interveners, their motions to intervene short, none of those were a surprise to us. So I would say everything, again, progressing as we would have expected there. The next step is for us to get the data requests from the interveners, which are due to us by the end of today actually. This will then start a series of requests and testimony that are scheduled really to continue through mid-August. And then once we get through that, that will culminate with the public hearing during the last week of August. And then as I think you know, the commission has indicated that they expect to provide a decision by November 6. Great. Thanks, Shar. Hey Durgesh. Yes, that will come out through the CPCN process, so that will be resolved all at the same time to get, Durgesh. Not an Eagle stand, but that's okay. Hey Paul. Yes. So, some of the things that we were -- we've been engaged in Pennsylvania, really with our -- with the state legislature as well as our regulator, the PUC. Most significantly, Paul, we've requested to have customers return to the EDC, so right, the companies like PPL Electric and to return to our default rate when they come off the standard offer program as that's where we've seen our customers gauge the most when they come off the standard offer plan. In some cases, our customers' rates have increased by more than 300% in the months following, coming off the standard offer program. So, we -- our recommendation was just to have folks once the standard offer program ends. If they hadn't already signed up for a new plan that they would just default to our default rate, which would limit how much the price could increase as opposed to, like I said, this 300% or more, which we have seen some of our customers get it with. We've also requested that suppliers provide detailed information about their agreements to our customers, both to the electric companies. So, again, companies like PPL Electric as well as the PUC, so that we can augment any supplier notifications and make sure that our customers understand some of these plans that they're signing up for. We've also asked for tighter restrictions around introductory or teaser rates as well as variable rates. Again, our customers have been impacted significantly by some of those areas. So, overall, I would just say we're really trying to see greater accountability with our suppliers. I'm not seeing that yet, Paul. But again, so we've been engaged with our public officials over the last couple of years on trying to get some of these measures implemented, and they haven't to-date, we are continuing to engage with them. I think, it's more pronounced now with what we've seen with wholesale power prices and natural gas prices. So we will continue to engage on behalf of our customers to try to get these wholesale -- or not the wholesale rates, but the rates that third-party suppliers are charging our customers. In many cases, as I said in my prepared remarks, customers are paying a lot more, even more than double our default rate. And you can go out on the PUC's website and actually get prices that are even cheaper than our default rate. And so, it's a huge issue, as you mentioned, and that's why we're spending a lot of time right now on educating our customers to make sure that they know what plans are available, but also to just make sure they really read the fine print and understand the plans that they're entering into and doing what's best for them and their family. Thanks, Paul. Hi, Angie. Yes, I'm not sure, I think, it would impact us one way or the other, Angie. I think, again, our CPCN has been designed to strike an appropriate balance with different fuel sources to provide that safe, reliable and affordable energy, while we're replacing 1,500 megawatts, that is reaching our end of lives. We've been very clear that we have not accelerated the retirement of our coal plants. These are plants that are end of life. And -- so our CP, or CPCN, with the commission is really how best to replace that retiring coal generation with the least cost, most reliable sources of energy. And as you know, we have a balance of combined cycle plants in there with solar, with some storage, et cetera. So I don't know that I would see the -- whether the sale process or whether the asset remains with AEP really impacting our process. Yes, you would think so, Angie. So our price to compare is about $0.0145. There are suppliers out there that are below $0.10 exactly to your point. We've had to procure that power over six, 12, 18 months time horizons in accordance with the PUC process. So yes, so we're not necessarily getting the immediate impact of the precipitous decline in energy prices over the last month or two. Some of our suppliers are, which they're able to provide, like I said, $0.10 contracts, it makes it interesting that many of our customers were paying $0.20 and over $0.30 in December for their third-party supplier energy. So great point. Sure. Yes. No, that will be temporary, David. We do have third-party contracts that we can lean on in times of need, which we've done. We've also reallocated some of our existing folks in other departments and train them up on the call center activity. So, yes, of course, the third-party contracts, we could dial those up and down as needed and then our internal resources -- they'll just go back to their other departments when we're through with the call center duties that we have been doing. So, those price estimates that are in our CPCN are all based on current pricing. And we ran the RFPs in the summertime. So, those RFP prices are included for solar projects. And again, we're using our internal cost estimates for the combined cycle units and any of the solar that we're proposing that we build. So, I would say cost estimates are up-to-date there. No major issues with having to adjust those with what's in the CPCN. Thanks Greg. Good morning Paul. Yes. So, it's -- we're early in that process, Paul, as you know. We did put a capital plan together to ensure the safety and reliability of the gas network while we work with the state on the future of gas docket, that will take some time to get through. Again, as we think about the gas networks, not only in Rhode Island, but across the country. We certainly see a future for those as to folks like EPRI and other independent research agencies in terms of the fuel that's flowing through those LDCs may be different. They may not be 100% natural gas. could have renewable natural gas, hydrogen, we could have other sources of fuel flowing through them, but there are certain processes that just don't lend themselves to electrification. And so long-term, while we certainly support and expect there to be a lot more electrification, we also expect there to be a need and a use for gas LDC networks. And so making sure that those networks are safe and reliable now continues to be a top priority, but we will certainly be engaged with the state on the long-term future of that network. Yes. There is actually -- we are entering into mediation next week on February 22. That will be before one of the judges in the Texas bankruptcy court. So, yes, there is an update there. We'll be heading into mediation next week. Yes. Thanks, Neil. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. I just want to reiterate, again, really pleased with our 2022 results where we ultimately came in, what we accomplished in 2022 to set us up for 2023 and beyond and just, really remain confident in our ability to deliver on what we've laid out for you all. And I can tell you the entire management team is aligned around the new strategy, and we're really looking forward to delivering it.

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. Our solid fourth quarter financial results closed out a great year for the company. Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share. Special items in the fourth quarter were $0.02 per share, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, partially offset by a tax benefit due to the provision to final 2021 tax return adjustments, primarily related to the sale of WPD. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.28 per share, an improvement of $0.06 per share compared to 2021. With these strong fourth quarter results, our 2022 GAAP earnings totaled $1.02 per share. Special items for the year were $0.39 per share, primarily related to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Our ongoing earnings for the year were $1.41 per share compared to $1.05 per share for 2021 exceeding the midpoint of our earnings forecast for 2022. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on slide nine. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to milder than normal weather last year and increased returns on additional capital investments in transmission. These improvements were offset partially by higher O&M expenses. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year. Improved sales volumes in Kentucky also due to milder than normal weather experienced last year were more than offset by higher O&M and interest expense. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.03 per share for the quarter. Results at Corporate and Other increased $0.03 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expenses, lower income taxes, and other factors that were not individually significant. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense. Our strong performance in the fourth quarter reflects another proof point of delivering on expectations since our repositioning last year. Our results for the full year are on slide 10. We reported improved results across each business segment in 2022. The operating segment results presented here exclude the impact of share accretion, which we've shown as a separate bar on the far right of the slide. Recall that we used a portion of the UK business sales proceeds to repurchase $1 billion of shares back in the fourth quarter of 2021, resulting in $0.05 of accretion in 2022. We also used another $4 billion of the UK sales proceeds to reduce our holding company debt, strengthening our balance sheet to one of the best in the sector. This reduction of debt was the primary driver for the $0.10 improvement in our Corporate and Other segment for the year. Turning to the operating segments. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment delivered a $0.06 per share increase for the year compared to 2021. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher peak transmission demand, and improved sales volumes. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including increased uncollectibles, additional vegetation management costs, and IT amortization costs. Our Kentucky Regulated segment earnings increased by $0.07 per share for the year compared to 2021. Our improved results in Kentucky were primarily driven by a full year of higher retail rates that went into effect in July 2021 and higher sales volumes. These favorable drivers were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, including vegetation management, plant outage and storm costs, and higher depreciation expense. Our Rhode Island segment added $0.08 per share to ongoing earnings for the year, reflecting the period from our acquisition in late May through the end of the year. This was a great year for the company and is yet another demonstration of our commitment to deliver on and exceed our financial goals. Turning to slide 11. We expect to keep that momentum heading into this year. Today, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings forecast range of $1.50 to $1.65 per share and the midpoint of $1.58 per share. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our forecast by leveraging our proven operating model, a strategy focused on driving cost efficiencies to reduce O&M, which enables investments necessary to advance our energy networks in the most affordable manner. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.04 per share in 2023, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission and lower O&M, partially offset by higher interest expense. We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.05 per share in 2023, primarily due to lower O&M, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.08 per share in 2023, primarily due to the impact of a full year's earnings. We project corporate and other results to be flat year-over-year. Moving to slide 12. In connection with the request from many of our investors, we've reallocated our Kentucky holding company financing costs to corporate and other, beginning January 1. This reallocation provides a clearer view of the utility earnings for our Kentucky Regulated segment and is consistent with how we report the Pennsylvania and Rhode Island segments. We've illustrated the impact of this reallocation to our actual 2022 ongoing earnings on this slide to show the 2022 segment results on a consistent basis with our 2023 segment forecast. Moving to slide 13. Our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share to be paid on April 3 to shareholders of record as of March 10. As we discussed in January, the $0.24 dividend is a 7% increase that aligns with our predictable, linear and competitive annual EPS growth of 6% to 8%. This is also within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65%, combining our targeted EPS growth with our dividend yield provides investors with a compelling total return proposition in the range of 9% to 11% per year. This is consistent with our mission of delivering long-term returns to shareholders. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Hey, Dave, it's Joe. It's -- there's no implications to either of those. It's really just the reallocation of those costs that we were -- we had been allocating to the Kentucky segment to and really from an investor perspective to align the Kentucky segment to the similar way that we had been reporting Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. So no implications there. Hey, Neil, it's Joe. So a couple of points there. First on the Rhode Island guidance for 2023. I think, we've discussed in the past a few times that we expect to experience some variability or noise in our Rhode Island earnings as we work through the transition period and stand up Rhode Island on our systems and processes. And so, that's what you're seeing here. The primary driver of those lower earnings are due to costs, as we work our way off the TSA, their costs such as staffing up our operations, training our new full-time employees, things like that. I do expect that to normalize once we've completed the TSA period in 2024. And again, we expected this from the outset, and it's been embedded in our projections. And so, our outlook for Rhode Island remains very positive, as we execute the plan, and I certainly expect to see growth there in 2024. As far as the O&M savings that we're projecting for 2023, the $50 million to $60 million, those come predominantly from Pennsylvania and Kentucky for the same reason I talked about in Rhode Island. We're still working our way off those TSAs. So until we're on our systems and processes, we can't really drive O&M savings there through the transition period. I think, 25% is certainly a normal year. We'll be off the TSAs by that period, sometime in 2024. So we get a clean year in 2025. It will have been some time since the last rate case there. I think National Grid's last rate case was 2018. So we certainly expect to see an improvement in ROEs. We may need a rate case following that. But I think we'll continue to work through the plan and execute what we have in store there and see where we are. But we feel -- again, we feel good about the growth prospects in Rhode Island. Yes."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the PPL conference call on third quarter 2022 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our Web site. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer, and conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Turning to Slide 4. We had another solid quarter of financial results as we execute our Utility of the Future strategy. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.24 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share compared with $0.36 per share a year ago. Based on our strong financial performance year-to-date, today, we increased the midpoint of our earnings forecast from $1.37 per share to $1.40 per share, and narrowed our earnings forecast range to $1.35 to $1.45 per share. Our 2022 earnings guidance reflects a partial year estimate of contributions from Rhode Island Energy, which we acquired on May 25th. Today, we also reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2025. Our per share growth target is based off the midpoint of our pro forma 2022 forecast range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share or $1.48 per share. The pro forma forecast reflects a full year of earnings contribution from Rhode Island Energy. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our growth projections, even in the current macro environment of rising interest rates, high inflation and high commodity costs. At a time when affordability is paramount for our customers, our strategy and strong balance sheet provide PPL significant resilience. Namely, our current business plan does not rely on rate cases to achieve our stated growth targets. We expect to recover about 55% of our current five year CapEx plan through riders and formularate, reducing regulatory lag and supporting continued strong credit metrics. And our strong balance sheet will support growth without the need for equity issuances over the planned period, while providing financial flexibility to effectively manage market volatility. We also continue to execute our business transformation initiatives, focused on driving efficiency, affordability and improved reliability for our customers. As we outlined in our Q2 call, this includes hardening the system, deploying smart grid technology and leveraging data science across our T&D operations, optimizing our generation outage schedules and nonoutage maintenance costs and centralizing shared services while deploying common systems and platforms. We remain confident that we will achieve our planned O&M savings of at least $150 million through 2025 with the potential for additional upside beyond 2025. Bottom line, we believe we are well positioned to weather current economic conditions while driving substantial value for both customers and shareowners. Shifting to a few operational highlights on Slide 5. In Kentucky, we continue to evaluate opportunities to advance the transition of our generation fleet, transition that will offer long term value for our customers and help deliver the clean energy transition in Kentucky. We continue to expect to retire 1,000 megawatts of coal fired generation by 2028, with the potential to retire an additional 500 megawatts due to EPA's Good Neighbor rule. In connection with these expected retirements and following the RFP completed earlier this year, we're targeting a mid-December filing with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, which would include requests for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, for any supply side assets that would be owned by us. We're also updating our load forecast to reflect the recent economic development in our service territories, including Ford's EV battery plant as well as updating demand side management and energy efficiency programs to fully address the demand side of the equation. As we evaluate our supply options, we're focusing on solutions that are lease cost and will ensure the reliability our customers need and expect. We anticipate these lease cost solutions will be a combination of company owned resources and power purchase agreements and will include solar, energy storage and combined cycle natural gas. We also expect this generation replacement strategy to significantly improve the carbon intensity of our Kentucky generation fleet. Our mid-December filing will begin a regulatory review process that will conclude with an order from the KPSC. While there is no statutory timing requirement for the KPSC to review a CPCN filing, we would expect to conclude the regulatory review process by the end of 2023. In other updates, our Rhode Island Energy subsidiary expects to file several plans with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission by the end of Q4 that will support our customers' evolving energy needs. We've already filed our annual energy efficiency plan in late September, which is critical to our reliability, customer satisfaction, affordability and sustainability objectives. Within the next couple of months, we'll file the company's annual infrastructure, safety and reliability plans for both electric and gas, which will outline our plans to enhance the reliability of state's energy infrastructure while at the same time, preparing the electric grid for more renewable energy, including offshore wind and distributed energy resources. Costs approved through the ISR plan will be recoverable through the ISR rider mechanism, which reduces regulatory lag for these investments between base rate cases. By the end of the year, we also expect to file our advanced metering plans at the Rhode Island PUC, outlining the deployment of advanced meters to our electricity and gas customers in the state. PPL has experience installing almost 3 million advanced meters and realizing the benefits that those meters can provide. We will leverage this experience in Rhode Island and deliver this value for our Rhode Island customers as well. Our advanced metering plan will be foundational for our grid modernization plan, which we also plan to file by year end. The GMP is a longer term strategic initiative we're developing in support of the needs of our customers as we deliver the grid capable of connecting 100% renewable energy by 2033, which is now a law in Rhode Island. And finally, in late October, we announced a strategic partnership with the Elia Group to support the development of transmission solutions for offshore wind in the New England region. Specifically, PPL and Elia signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop and propose innovative transmission solutions to integrate offshore wind to the onshore grid. We believe PPL and Elia are uniquely suited to support New England in this regard. Elia has been a clear pioneer in developing offshore transmission grid solutions through its subsidiaries in Belgium and Germany as the company has connected 14 offshore wind farms to the onshore grid. Meanwhile, PPL has established a proven track record of successfully citing, building and operating large transmission projects here in the US. Both of our companies are clear leaders in grid innovation and reliability. And we both share a strong focus on advancing the clean energy future, while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable. Together, we recently responded to a request for information issued by five New England states that are seeking input on potential transmission system changes and upgrades to integrate future offshore wind generation with current estimates of as much as 30 gigawatts by 2050. Moving forward, we anticipate forming a joint venture with Elia to pursue any potential offshore transmission opportunities that may arise after the RFI. We expect an RFP for proposed transmission projects in New England could be issued as early as third quarter 2023. Many offshore transmission projects stemming from this effort are expected to drive investments beyond 2026, and would be expected to be FERC jurisdictional projects under FERC formula rates. And while we are in the early stages of this process, we're excited to be participating in the process and are optimistic that PPL and Elia can develop innovative and cost effective offshore transmission solutions for New England. Any investments made through this partnership would be incremental to the $27 billion of capital investment opportunities through 2030 that we highlighted at our Investor Day. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 7. We reported 2022 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.24 per share. Special items in the third quarter were $0.17 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, commitments made during the acquisition process and impacts associated with the sale of Safari, which we announced in late September and closed on earlier this week. Adjusting for these special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share, an improvement of $0.05 per share compared to last year. Another strong quarter brings our year-to-date GAAP earnings to $0.77 per share. Adjusting for year-to-date special items of $0.36 per share, our ongoing earnings results are $1.13 per share through nine months of 2022 compared to $0.83 in 2021. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.01 per share year-over-year, excluding share accretion. The increased earnings in Pennsylvania were driven by lower O&M expenses in the period, primarily from lower storm and support group costs. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year, excluding share accretion. The decrease was due to various factors that were not individually significant. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.04 per share for the quarter. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to the prior year due to factors that were not individually significant. Finally, our third quarter results were $0.02 higher due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of stock buybacks completed in 2021. Turning to Slide 9. Our results to date support the $0.03 increase in the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast to $1.40 per share. As shown on the left of the slide, the primary drivers of the increase in our forecast are at our Kentucky and Rhode Island segments with higher margins due to favorable weather compared to our forecast in Kentucky, as well as lower O&M expenses in both jurisdictions as we execute on our business transformation. Turning to the right part of the slide. We've also narrowed our forecast, increasing the bottom end of the range to $1.35 per share from $1.30 per share given our strong year-to-date performance and only a few months remaining in the year. In closing, our financial results to date reflect the improved low risk profile of the new PPL as we continue to deliver for both customers and shareowners. Our strategic actions have well positioned PPL to achieve those results with an excellent financial foundation and a strong balance sheet to navigate the current macroeconomic environment. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our growth projections of 6% to 8% in earnings and dividends through 2025. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, I'm proud of how we continue to execute the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Across PPL, we are laser focused on creating technology enabled utilities of the future, on delivering the clean energy transition reliably and affordably and on driving long term value for our customers and our shareowners. Our strategy delivers top tier earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually. And as we said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver this growth. Our growth is supported by $27 billion in investment opportunities through 2030 and one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. It's anchored in operational efficiencies in the near term with stronger rate base growth driving earnings growth later in the decade. And we firmly believe it's the right strategy at the right time to effectively manage the risks associated with the current macroeconomic environment, while continuing to deliver real value for our customers and shareowners. Across our company, we continue to execute our plans for the new PPL and we're as excited as we've ever been about our future. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: So just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned again today that a CCGT and some renewables would be leading candidates for new energy and capacity. Has the IRA kind of changed the calculus on your potential ownership of the latter, so being renewables? And I guess, how should we think about scale there?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, it clearly has. So the IRA has clearly improved the competitiveness of company owned renewables versus third party PPA pricing, Shar, right? The PTC optionality there plus the additional tax attribute enhancements for certain types of labor, apprenticeship programs and in our case, we're using coal sites, et cetera. So clearly, the economics are moving in the right direction from where we were before to now post IRA. I don't want to get too far out in front of the filing in terms of how much of the resources we see. But clearly, I think there's an opportunity for solar, storage, combined cycle on the solar and storage side. I think we'll see a combination of PPAs and company owned there and then on the combined cycle, we would expect that to be company owned.\nShar Pourreza: And then just on the Rhode Island filings, Vince, are these sort of the gating mechanisms to maybe potentially narrow that CapEx range you have there? I mean, when you rolled out your plan, the out years had a roughly $200 million range between the bottom and top end. Now that you've been on the system, is this something we could see narrowed or even raised next year?\nVince Sorgi: I think that's a good point. I would say timing wise, Shar, you're probably right. I think we would see that maybe next year with our ability to narrow those ranges. We really want to get through this first regulatory process in the state. So these filings are our first filings in the state, as you know. And so we would expect to get through those kind of mid next year, and that will set us up for a much clearer view of '23, '24.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just firstly, just I think -- can you size the CapEx dollars for us? Or did I hear you say you don't want to kind of get ahead of the filing in terms of what this might mean. I'm thinking of just the Kentucky generation bucket separately and then Rhode Island separately.\nVince Sorgi: So for Kentucky, I would say the opportunity is probably in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, Durgesh, in total. The piece that could pull into the five year period would probably be in the $1 billion to $2 billion. So as you know, we had generation replacement in the $15 billion bucket, the $27 billion to $30 billion bucket of our $27 billion. And so as we look at what we're seeing now with the CPCN filing where I think we're going to see some of that pull into '25, '26 as we prepare for '27, 2028 in service dates for some of these options. So $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion total, $1 billion to $2 billion moving potentially into the five year period.\nDurgesh Chopra: And how about just the Rhode Island opportunity here? You've got the AMF, the GMV. How should we -- is there a way to kind of handicap what the CapEx upside might be there?\nVince Sorgi: I think the ranges that we provided incorporate what we're talking about with these current filings. And again, once we get through, I think, this first round in the state, we'll be able to narrow that range following next year's -- in next year's update.\nDurgesh Chopra: And then just one, hopefully, quickly following up. You have -- am I right in thinking about the balance sheet capacity that whether it's the Kentucky upside or the Rhode Island CapEx upside that you can absorb that without having to issue equity?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. We resized the balance sheet to not only fund the CapEx we had in the plan but those two upsides as well, yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: I was just wondering, would you be able to talk about or size the potential upside in transmission CapEx that's outside of the offshore transmission opportunities, if you're seeing any?\nVince Sorgi: Are you specifically referring to Rhode Island or more generally, David?\nDavid Arcaro: More generally, I was thinking.\nVince Sorgi: So we continue to look at transmission across the portfolio in all three of our jurisdictions, continue to see opportunity for additional system hardening, as well as smart grid technology in those networks, primarily in Rhode Island and Kentucky. So definitely see additional opportunity there. I would say in the $27 billion, we have that opportunity in there. Again, that's probably an area where maybe some of that could get pulled in from the back half of the decade into the current five year plan. But that will all be part of our more fulsome update once we get through the regulatory filings in Kentucky and then come out with our normal cadence with our update would be on the year end call in February. But yes, those are all areas that we're looking at.\nDavid Arcaro: And then wondering if you could give an update, just a level of kind of execution risk in achieving the O&M cost cuts in terms of the backdrop that you're seeing right now? And just looking over the next 12 months, what's your level of confidence in being able to kick things off aggressively on that path?\nVince Sorgi: We're feeling very confident in our ability to hit at least the $150 million by 2025. Again, we talked about a potential upside to beyond 2025. Joe talked about for the 2022 forecast, really two main areas there, weather and then O&M. The real source of O&M, both in Rhode Island and Kentucky is the result of our business transformation and centralization efforts. And so I would say we're ahead of schedule on that, David, which is great. And so it just gives us further confidence that we'll be able to at least hit the $150 million going into 2025.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Just curious on the Kentucky generation transformation opportunity, can you remind us how much does that depend on an acceleration of coal plant retirements? And what's your -- like, has your forecast of the timing of shutting down some of the coal plants in the state changed?\nVince Sorgi: So the transformation initiatives in Kentucky are really not, I would say, directly tied to -- well, they're certainly not tied to accelerating our coal plant retirement. So our existing retirement dates other than one unit that we had in 2034 that we think may need to be pulled up into the 2020s as a result of the EPA Good Neighbor rule. But other than that, our existing end-of-life depreciation dates are what's in the plan, Michael. On the transformation initiatives or the O&M reduction initiatives, we're just -- that's enabling us to just be more prudent in how we're looking at outage scheduling and overall O&M on those plants that we\u2019ll be retiring in 2024 and 2028. So there's some linkage there, but I wouldn't say it's really dependent. And then in terms of overall acceleration of coal plant retirements, we're really not factoring that into our update today, again, other than that one 2034 plant and the potential for that to get pulled in. But again, as we see economics continue to change, freight regulation continue to change, that's certainly something that we will continue to keep an eye on. But our existing depreciation dates are really what's driving the CapEx opportunity there.\nMichael Lapides: So if you don't build a combined cycle in the next five to seven years, do you see yourself having a shortage of effective base load or non-intermittent generation by the latter part of the decade?\nVince Sorgi: I don't necessarily want to speculate on that, Michael. I think we're kind of finishing the analysis right now for the CPCN. We'll make that filing with the commission and then we'll go through the regulatory process there. So would rather not speculate on what is like that until we get through the process with the commission.\nMichael Lapides: So in other words, the CPCN filing will show a supply and demand for the service territories in Kentucky and therefore, will show whether there's a potential -- effectively the supply need?\nVince Sorgi: Absolutely. So we're updating the load forecast. So we're including all of the economic development that we're seeing in the state. So that's an increased load. We're updating our DSM and energy efficiency plan. So that will be a decrease to load. So we'll have a full blown updated load forecast. We'll look at all the capacity that's retiring and then the amount of the capacity and energy required to meet that load on a 24/7 basis. So yes, all of that will be included in the filing, that will all be public on the KPSC's Web site. You'll see all of the input and output assumptions that we made from the modeling that we've done. The only thing we'll do is we'll see confidential protection on any commercially sensitive information like the actual bid prices from the RFP. But other than that, you'll get a very clear picture of the supply need and the lease cost solution to solve that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo: Just want to check on the interest rate side of the house. I know in the past, you've been active on hedging. And just have you added any new additional swaps, hedges, anything like that? Just broadly, if you could comment on comfort about the variable rate exposure?\nVince Sorgi: I'll let Joe take that.\nJoe Bergstein: So from a variable rate exposure, about 15% of our consolidated long term debt portfolio is floating rate. So the total debt portfolio is about $13 billion. We feel comfortable with that level of floating rate exposure and really don't see any material impact to the plan from fluctuations that we've seen to date in interest rates. And so maybe I could just make a couple of comments overall on interest rates broadly even outside of the floating rate exposure. We still feel very good about our plan despite the recent rise in interest rates. And obviously, we reaffirmed our long term growth forecast this morning. We've discussed several times and on our Investor Day that we've developed a plan that's low risk and contemplated the macro headwinds that we see, including interest rates. And there are several factors that we have and levers that we have within our plan to help offset the higher rates. Those are tracking mechanisms that we have in our jurisdictions to help mitigate exposure, 55% of our capital runs through some form of tracker or rider. Obviously, we're very focused on operational efficiencies. We have the potential to outperform on our savings targets within this plan period. And then from a load perspective, we've not incorporated any load growth in our current business plan. And we do continue to see load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. And in Kentucky, we have known incremental upside as well with the economic development that's been announced recently within the state. And then just on Rhode Island, we are decoupled there, so load is not a factor.\nPaul Zimbardo: And just following up on the load side actually. I was kind of curious, things seem to be moving around a bit between Kentucky, Pennsylvania. Residential was a little weak in Pennsylvania, but strong Kentucky and the opposite for industrial. So just if you could give a little bit more insight on what you're seeing on the ground?\nVince Sorgi: So I would say in both jurisdictions, the general economy continues to be strong. You're seeing that in Pennsylvania C&I load, even in Kentucky C&I -- commercial is up. Industrial is down in Kentucky really due to one steel manufacturer and this is really just a year-over-year anomaly where last year, there was a lot of pent up demand coming out of the pandemic. And so the production was higher than we've ever seen it. And so we've kind of, I would say, normalized back to normal levels for that one steel customer. And then on -- so really no underlying issues with the economy there. And then you're right, on the residential, we saw a bit of a dip in the third quarter versus last year. We really think that, that's related to just customers' immediate response to the high commodity prices that we're seeing now flow through our bills. So the wholesale prices are up and where we're adjusting our prices accordingly. And so we think there's some level of just conservation going on within the residentials to try to manage their bills there. But again, no underlying impacts around the general economy, and I think that continues to look strong.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Campanella with Credit Suisse.\nNick Campanella: So I just wanted to ask on the credit side. And I'm sorry if I'm making you repeat yourself. I don't know if I heard it, but just as we think about the kind of potential megawatt additions that you're contemplating in Kentucky. Can you execute on those without additional, call it, growth equity capital?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, we can, Nick.\nNick Campanella: And then just how does IRA kind of affect your credit stance, if at all?\nVince Sorgi: Not a major impact on credit. So really the AMT provision is probably maybe where you're going on that. Again, we don't see any impact on our cash flows coming from the AMT. We generally use our tax attributes. When we sold WPD, we were about a 15% taxpayer in our projections anyway. Of course, they modified the rules there at the very end. There's still a lot of regulation that still needs to come from treasury on the final act. So when we look at it, Nick, really not anticipating any impact on our cash position as a result of AMT. And then on the other provisions, the clean energy provisions, obviously, those are supportive of us being more competitive on company owned renewables versus third party PPAs. But again, that's not going to really drive any credit impacts.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Just a few quick follow-ups. The remuneration component in Rhode Island that I think you guys are foregoing in the RFP. I just wasn't clear why that was taking place, or could you give a little bit more color as to the thought process behind that?\nVince Sorgi: The way the final law came out on that, Paul, was that we were only able to earn that remuneration up until 2026. And if you look at the -- when those contracts will actually come online that would not happen within the window that was allotted in the law. So there really wasn't any reason to try to go after any remuneration when the reality is we wouldn't be able to pick up any given the timing constraints in the law.\nPaul Patterson: And then the Elia JV, I read the release, I think, from last week. Just other than Elia's expertise and our experience in Europe. Is there anything else that you can elaborate on in terms of the competitive advantage you guys think that you guys are mentioning today and on the release, I mean, sort of like what do you think -- could you give a little bit more color with respect to that?\nVince Sorgi: Well, I certainly don't want to talk about where we think our competitive advantages would be versus competing bidders in that process. But again, I would just say, given Elia's deep expertise in offshore and our deep expertise in onshore and ISO, understanding of the ISOs and siting, operating and building transmission here in the US. I think our partnership creates a great opportunity for us to bring innovative solutions to New England. But I don't want to get into any more detail on that.\nPaul Patterson: I don\u2019t want you guys to give away your competitive advantage. But I just -- could it be anywhere beyond -- I mean, you mentioned New England. But is there any thought of -- anything wider than New England or just New England?\nVince Sorgi: Potentially, there could be opportunity there. Obviously, the New England opportunity is in front of us right now, and that's where we're focused. But again, I think the opportunity for a long term partnership with Elia is certainly there. And given our two skill sets, it's not unique to necessarily to just New England. But clearly, that's where our focus is right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Quick following up on Paul's question earlier on load. You gave some nice detail and I know Rhode Island is decoupled, so it really doesn't matter. But you mentioned you are seeing some residential load cutback maybe because of high builds. Just thought on where you're forecasting load growth in '24 or even in your five year period, if you've provided that.\nVince Sorgi: So our current plan, we have really no load growth built in for [PA] in Kentucky, so we're relatively flat across that period.\nAnthony Crowdell: Does the change in residential cause concern on your plan, or do you think it's going to be more temporary and that you'll be able to hit your plan [on fly]?\nVince Sorgi: I think it's likely temporary, but it's also just the way our tariff structures are, Anthony, we're really most heavily weighted to load fluctuations in Kentucky. PA, we do have some impact from load but it's not as impactful as Kentucky just because of the way we have demand charges, fixed charges in PA versus those levels in Kentucky. But what we're seeing in PA, one, I think you're right, that will probably be more of a temporary reaction to the pricing but also just the tariff structure doesn't give us really cause for concern.\nAnthony Crowdell: And just lastly, you gave some great detail earlier on, on a lot of CapEx opportunities. if I could just take a step back and wonder. Do you think there's any ability within the current five year plan of changes to the rate base growth rate, or that if those plans come to fruition that, that's more something on the back end of the decade? You talked about AMI, you talked about some RFP in Kentucky. Just is that the ability for that to maybe hit the five year plan?\nVince Sorgi: As I talked earlier, again, I think the total CapEx opportunity in Kentucky is probably in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, Anthony. But I think $1 billion to $2 billion of that could actually come into the five year period, which obviously would raise rate base growth compared to what our current plan shows.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe Research.\nDavid Paz: You may have just addressed this, but let me maybe ask it differently. When you update your long term EPS growth outlook in February, will you incorporate the Kentucky CPCN filing into your growth target? And if so, how much do you anticipate the gap between that long term rate base and EPS growth targets to narrow?\nVince Sorgi: Joe, do you want to talk to that?\nJoe Bergstein: So we'll incorporate at least some of that CapEx that we would file relative to the CPCN when we update our plan next year. As far as closing the gap between rate base and earnings growth, I think it's a little early to say exactly how much that will close. It will certainly close because if you think about the generation need in Kentucky and those units coming off-line, the whole units coming offline in 2028, we'll need the new generation to be ready to serve load at that time. And so construction would have to start probably beginning in 2025. So I think you'd see incremental capital related to replacement gen in '25 and '26, which certainly would help to close the current gap between rate based growth and earnings growth.\nVince Sorgi: David, I would just say that update will be a fulsome update. So we will not just update it for Kentucky CapEx related to generation, but across the portfolio where we see incremental capital needs. Again, we've talked about transmission in prior questions. So we'll do a fulsome update to Joe's point, that will help close the gap between the two.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thank you. Just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we're looking forward to seeing everybody at EEI. Stay safe, and we'll see you soon.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Turning to Slide 4. We had another solid quarter of financial results as we execute our Utility of the Future strategy. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.24 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share compared with $0.36 per share a year ago. Based on our strong financial performance year-to-date, today, we increased the midpoint of our earnings forecast from $1.37 per share to $1.40 per share, and narrowed our earnings forecast range to $1.35 to $1.45 per share. Our 2022 earnings guidance reflects a partial year estimate of contributions from Rhode Island Energy, which we acquired on May 25th. Today, we also reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2025. Our per share growth target is based off the midpoint of our pro forma 2022 forecast range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share or $1.48 per share. The pro forma forecast reflects a full year of earnings contribution from Rhode Island Energy. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our growth projections, even in the current macro environment of rising interest rates, high inflation and high commodity costs. At a time when affordability is paramount for our customers, our strategy and strong balance sheet provide PPL significant resilience. Namely, our current business plan does not rely on rate cases to achieve our stated growth targets. We expect to recover about 55% of our current five year CapEx plan through riders and formularate, reducing regulatory lag and supporting continued strong credit metrics. And our strong balance sheet will support growth without the need for equity issuances over the planned period, while providing financial flexibility to effectively manage market volatility. We also continue to execute our business transformation initiatives, focused on driving efficiency, affordability and improved reliability for our customers. As we outlined in our Q2 call, this includes hardening the system, deploying smart grid technology and leveraging data science across our T&D operations, optimizing our generation outage schedules and nonoutage maintenance costs and centralizing shared services while deploying common systems and platforms. We remain confident that we will achieve our planned O&M savings of at least $150 million through 2025 with the potential for additional upside beyond 2025. Bottom line, we believe we are well positioned to weather current economic conditions while driving substantial value for both customers and shareowners. Shifting to a few operational highlights on Slide 5. In Kentucky, we continue to evaluate opportunities to advance the transition of our generation fleet, transition that will offer long term value for our customers and help deliver the clean energy transition in Kentucky. We continue to expect to retire 1,000 megawatts of coal fired generation by 2028, with the potential to retire an additional 500 megawatts due to EPA's Good Neighbor rule. In connection with these expected retirements and following the RFP completed earlier this year, we're targeting a mid-December filing with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, which would include requests for Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity, or CPCN, for any supply side assets that would be owned by us. We're also updating our load forecast to reflect the recent economic development in our service territories, including Ford's EV battery plant as well as updating demand side management and energy efficiency programs to fully address the demand side of the equation. As we evaluate our supply options, we're focusing on solutions that are lease cost and will ensure the reliability our customers need and expect. We anticipate these lease cost solutions will be a combination of company owned resources and power purchase agreements and will include solar, energy storage and combined cycle natural gas. We also expect this generation replacement strategy to significantly improve the carbon intensity of our Kentucky generation fleet. Our mid-December filing will begin a regulatory review process that will conclude with an order from the KPSC. While there is no statutory timing requirement for the KPSC to review a CPCN filing, we would expect to conclude the regulatory review process by the end of 2023. In other updates, our Rhode Island Energy subsidiary expects to file several plans with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission by the end of Q4 that will support our customers' evolving energy needs. We've already filed our annual energy efficiency plan in late September, which is critical to our reliability, customer satisfaction, affordability and sustainability objectives. Within the next couple of months, we'll file the company's annual infrastructure, safety and reliability plans for both electric and gas, which will outline our plans to enhance the reliability of state's energy infrastructure while at the same time, preparing the electric grid for more renewable energy, including offshore wind and distributed energy resources. Costs approved through the ISR plan will be recoverable through the ISR rider mechanism, which reduces regulatory lag for these investments between base rate cases. By the end of the year, we also expect to file our advanced metering plans at the Rhode Island PUC, outlining the deployment of advanced meters to our electricity and gas customers in the state. PPL has experience installing almost 3 million advanced meters and realizing the benefits that those meters can provide. We will leverage this experience in Rhode Island and deliver this value for our Rhode Island customers as well. Our advanced metering plan will be foundational for our grid modernization plan, which we also plan to file by year end. The GMP is a longer term strategic initiative we're developing in support of the needs of our customers as we deliver the grid capable of connecting 100% renewable energy by 2033, which is now a law in Rhode Island. And finally, in late October, we announced a strategic partnership with the Elia Group to support the development of transmission solutions for offshore wind in the New England region. Specifically, PPL and Elia signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly develop and propose innovative transmission solutions to integrate offshore wind to the onshore grid. We believe PPL and Elia are uniquely suited to support New England in this regard. Elia has been a clear pioneer in developing offshore transmission grid solutions through its subsidiaries in Belgium and Germany as the company has connected 14 offshore wind farms to the onshore grid. Meanwhile, PPL has established a proven track record of successfully citing, building and operating large transmission projects here in the US. Both of our companies are clear leaders in grid innovation and reliability. And we both share a strong focus on advancing the clean energy future, while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable. Together, we recently responded to a request for information issued by five New England states that are seeking input on potential transmission system changes and upgrades to integrate future offshore wind generation with current estimates of as much as 30 gigawatts by 2050. Moving forward, we anticipate forming a joint venture with Elia to pursue any potential offshore transmission opportunities that may arise after the RFI. We expect an RFP for proposed transmission projects in New England could be issued as early as third quarter 2023. Many offshore transmission projects stemming from this effort are expected to drive investments beyond 2026, and would be expected to be FERC jurisdictional projects under FERC formula rates. And while we are in the early stages of this process, we're excited to be participating in the process and are optimistic that PPL and Elia can develop innovative and cost effective offshore transmission solutions for New England. Any investments made through this partnership would be incremental to the $27 billion of capital investment opportunities through 2030 that we highlighted at our Investor Day. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe? Thank you, Joe. In closing, I'm proud of how we continue to execute the strategy we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Across PPL, we are laser focused on creating technology enabled utilities of the future, on delivering the clean energy transition reliably and affordably and on driving long term value for our customers and our shareowners. Our strategy delivers top tier earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually. And as we said, we remain confident in our ability to deliver this growth. Our growth is supported by $27 billion in investment opportunities through 2030 and one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. It's anchored in operational efficiencies in the near term with stronger rate base growth driving earnings growth later in the decade. And we firmly believe it's the right strategy at the right time to effectively manage the risks associated with the current macroeconomic environment, while continuing to deliver real value for our customers and shareowners. Across our company, we continue to execute our plans for the new PPL and we're as excited as we've ever been about our future. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, it clearly has. So the IRA has clearly improved the competitiveness of company owned renewables versus third party PPA pricing, Shar, right? The PTC optionality there plus the additional tax attribute enhancements for certain types of labor, apprenticeship programs and in our case, we're using coal sites, et cetera. So clearly, the economics are moving in the right direction from where we were before to now post IRA. I don't want to get too far out in front of the filing in terms of how much of the resources we see. But clearly, I think there's an opportunity for solar, storage, combined cycle on the solar and storage side. I think we'll see a combination of PPAs and company owned there and then on the combined cycle, we would expect that to be company owned. I think that's a good point. I would say timing wise, Shar, you're probably right. I think we would see that maybe next year with our ability to narrow those ranges. We really want to get through this first regulatory process in the state. So these filings are our first filings in the state, as you know. And so we would expect to get through those kind of mid next year, and that will set us up for a much clearer view of '23, '24. So for Kentucky, I would say the opportunity is probably in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, Durgesh, in total. The piece that could pull into the five year period would probably be in the $1 billion to $2 billion. So as you know, we had generation replacement in the $15 billion bucket, the $27 billion to $30 billion bucket of our $27 billion. And so as we look at what we're seeing now with the CPCN filing where I think we're going to see some of that pull into '25, '26 as we prepare for '27, 2028 in service dates for some of these options. So $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion total, $1 billion to $2 billion moving potentially into the five year period. I think the ranges that we provided incorporate what we're talking about with these current filings. And again, once we get through, I think, this first round in the state, we'll be able to narrow that range following next year's -- in next year's update. Yes. We resized the balance sheet to not only fund the CapEx we had in the plan but those two upsides as well, yes. Are you specifically referring to Rhode Island or more generally, David? So we continue to look at transmission across the portfolio in all three of our jurisdictions, continue to see opportunity for additional system hardening, as well as smart grid technology in those networks, primarily in Rhode Island and Kentucky. So definitely see additional opportunity there. I would say in the $27 billion, we have that opportunity in there. Again, that's probably an area where maybe some of that could get pulled in from the back half of the decade into the current five year plan. But that will all be part of our more fulsome update once we get through the regulatory filings in Kentucky and then come out with our normal cadence with our update would be on the year end call in February. But yes, those are all areas that we're looking at. We're feeling very confident in our ability to hit at least the $150 million by 2025. Again, we talked about a potential upside to beyond 2025. Joe talked about for the 2022 forecast, really two main areas there, weather and then O&M. The real source of O&M, both in Rhode Island and Kentucky is the result of our business transformation and centralization efforts. And so I would say we're ahead of schedule on that, David, which is great. And so it just gives us further confidence that we'll be able to at least hit the $150 million going into 2025. So the transformation initiatives in Kentucky are really not, I would say, directly tied to -- well, they're certainly not tied to accelerating our coal plant retirement. So our existing retirement dates other than one unit that we had in 2034 that we think may need to be pulled up into the 2020s as a result of the EPA Good Neighbor rule. But other than that, our existing end-of-life depreciation dates are what's in the plan, Michael. On the transformation initiatives or the O&M reduction initiatives, we're just -- that's enabling us to just be more prudent in how we're looking at outage scheduling and overall O&M on those plants that we'll be retiring in 2024 and 2028. So there's some linkage there, but I wouldn't say it's really dependent. And then in terms of overall acceleration of coal plant retirements, we're really not factoring that into our update today, again, other than that one 2034 plant and the potential for that to get pulled in. But again, as we see economics continue to change, freight regulation continue to change, that's certainly something that we will continue to keep an eye on. But our existing depreciation dates are really what's driving the CapEx opportunity there. I don't necessarily want to speculate on that, Michael. I think we're kind of finishing the analysis right now for the CPCN. We'll make that filing with the commission and then we'll go through the regulatory process there. So would rather not speculate on what is like that until we get through the process with the commission. Absolutely. So we're updating the load forecast. So we're including all of the economic development that we're seeing in the state. So that's an increased load. We're updating our DSM and energy efficiency plan. So that will be a decrease to load. So we'll have a full blown updated load forecast. We'll look at all the capacity that's retiring and then the amount of the capacity and energy required to meet that load on a 24/7 basis. So yes, all of that will be included in the filing, that will all be public on the KPSC's Web site. You'll see all of the input and output assumptions that we made from the modeling that we've done. The only thing we'll do is we'll see confidential protection on any commercially sensitive information like the actual bid prices from the RFP. But other than that, you'll get a very clear picture of the supply need and the lease cost solution to solve that. I'll let Joe take that. So I would say in both jurisdictions, the general economy continues to be strong. You're seeing that in Pennsylvania C&I load, even in Kentucky C&I -- commercial is up. Industrial is down in Kentucky really due to one steel manufacturer and this is really just a year-over-year anomaly where last year, there was a lot of pent up demand coming out of the pandemic. And so the production was higher than we've ever seen it. And so we've kind of, I would say, normalized back to normal levels for that one steel customer. And then on -- so really no underlying issues with the economy there. And then you're right, on the residential, we saw a bit of a dip in the third quarter versus last year. We really think that, that's related to just customers' immediate response to the high commodity prices that we're seeing now flow through our bills. So the wholesale prices are up and where we're adjusting our prices accordingly. And so we think there's some level of just conservation going on within the residentials to try to manage their bills there. But again, no underlying impacts around the general economy, and I think that continues to look strong. Yes, we can, Nick. Not a major impact on credit. So really the AMT provision is probably maybe where you're going on that. Again, we don't see any impact on our cash flows coming from the AMT. We generally use our tax attributes. When we sold WPD, we were about a 15% taxpayer in our projections anyway. Of course, they modified the rules there at the very end. There's still a lot of regulation that still needs to come from treasury on the final act. So when we look at it, Nick, really not anticipating any impact on our cash position as a result of AMT. And then on the other provisions, the clean energy provisions, obviously, those are supportive of us being more competitive on company owned renewables versus third party PPAs. But again, that's not going to really drive any credit impacts. The way the final law came out on that, Paul, was that we were only able to earn that remuneration up until 2026. And if you look at the -- when those contracts will actually come online that would not happen within the window that was allotted in the law. So there really wasn't any reason to try to go after any remuneration when the reality is we wouldn't be able to pick up any given the timing constraints in the law. Well, I certainly don't want to talk about where we think our competitive advantages would be versus competing bidders in that process. But again, I would just say, given Elia's deep expertise in offshore and our deep expertise in onshore and ISO, understanding of the ISOs and siting, operating and building transmission here in the US. I think our partnership creates a great opportunity for us to bring innovative solutions to New England. But I don't want to get into any more detail on that. Potentially, there could be opportunity there. Obviously, the New England opportunity is in front of us right now, and that's where we're focused. But again, I think the opportunity for a long term partnership with Elia is certainly there. And given our two skill sets, it's not unique to necessarily to just New England. But clearly, that's where our focus is right now. So our current plan, we have really no load growth built in for [PA] in Kentucky, so we're relatively flat across that period. I think it's likely temporary, but it's also just the way our tariff structures are, Anthony, we're really most heavily weighted to load fluctuations in Kentucky. PA, we do have some impact from load but it's not as impactful as Kentucky just because of the way we have demand charges, fixed charges in PA versus those levels in Kentucky. But what we're seeing in PA, one, I think you're right, that will probably be more of a temporary reaction to the pricing but also just the tariff structure doesn't give us really cause for concern. As I talked earlier, again, I think the total CapEx opportunity in Kentucky is probably in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, Anthony. But I think $1 billion to $2 billion of that could actually come into the five year period, which obviously would raise rate base growth compared to what our current plan shows. Joe, do you want to talk to that? David, I would just say that update will be a fulsome update. So we will not just update it for Kentucky CapEx related to generation, but across the portfolio where we see incremental capital needs. Again, we've talked about transmission in prior questions. So we'll do a fulsome update to Joe's point, that will help close the gap between the two. Great. Thank you. Just want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we're looking forward to seeing everybody at EEI. Stay safe, and we'll see you soon."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 7. We reported 2022 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.24 per share. Special items in the third quarter were $0.17 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy, commitments made during the acquisition process and impacts associated with the sale of Safari, which we announced in late September and closed on earlier this week. Adjusting for these special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share, an improvement of $0.05 per share compared to last year. Another strong quarter brings our year-to-date GAAP earnings to $0.77 per share. Adjusting for year-to-date special items of $0.36 per share, our ongoing earnings results are $1.13 per share through nine months of 2022 compared to $0.83 in 2021. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.01 per share year-over-year, excluding share accretion. The increased earnings in Pennsylvania were driven by lower O&M expenses in the period, primarily from lower storm and support group costs. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.01 per share year-over-year, excluding share accretion. The decrease was due to various factors that were not individually significant. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.04 per share for the quarter. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.01 lower compared to the prior year due to factors that were not individually significant. Finally, our third quarter results were $0.02 higher due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of stock buybacks completed in 2021. Turning to Slide 9. Our results to date support the $0.03 increase in the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast to $1.40 per share. As shown on the left of the slide, the primary drivers of the increase in our forecast are at our Kentucky and Rhode Island segments with higher margins due to favorable weather compared to our forecast in Kentucky, as well as lower O&M expenses in both jurisdictions as we execute on our business transformation. Turning to the right part of the slide. We've also narrowed our forecast, increasing the bottom end of the range to $1.35 per share from $1.30 per share given our strong year-to-date performance and only a few months remaining in the year. In closing, our financial results to date reflect the improved low risk profile of the new PPL as we continue to deliver for both customers and shareowners. Our strategic actions have well positioned PPL to achieve those results with an excellent financial foundation and a strong balance sheet to navigate the current macroeconomic environment. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our growth projections of 6% to 8% in earnings and dividends through 2025. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince. So from a variable rate exposure, about 15% of our consolidated long term debt portfolio is floating rate. So the total debt portfolio is about $13 billion. We feel comfortable with that level of floating rate exposure and really don't see any material impact to the plan from fluctuations that we've seen to date in interest rates. And so maybe I could just make a couple of comments overall on interest rates broadly even outside of the floating rate exposure. We still feel very good about our plan despite the recent rise in interest rates. And obviously, we reaffirmed our long term growth forecast this morning. We've discussed several times and on our Investor Day that we've developed a plan that's low risk and contemplated the macro headwinds that we see, including interest rates. And there are several factors that we have and levers that we have within our plan to help offset the higher rates. Those are tracking mechanisms that we have in our jurisdictions to help mitigate exposure, 55% of our capital runs through some form of tracker or rider. Obviously, we're very focused on operational efficiencies. We have the potential to outperform on our savings targets within this plan period. And then from a load perspective, we've not incorporated any load growth in our current business plan. And we do continue to see load growth in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. And in Kentucky, we have known incremental upside as well with the economic development that's been announced recently within the state. And then just on Rhode Island, we are decoupled there, so load is not a factor. So we'll incorporate at least some of that CapEx that we would file relative to the CPCN when we update our plan next year. As far as closing the gap between rate base and earnings growth, I think it's a little early to say exactly how much that will close. It will certainly close because if you think about the generation need in Kentucky and those units coming off-line, the whole units coming offline in 2028, we'll need the new generation to be ready to serve load at that time. And so construction would have to start probably beginning in 2025. So I think you'd see incremental capital related to replacement gen in '25 and '26, which certainly would help to close the current gap between rate based growth and earnings growth."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, VP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL conference call on second quarter 2022 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation and our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website. We will begin today\u2019s call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL\u2019s President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. Greg Dudkin, Chief Operating Officer, will also be available for the Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I will draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I will now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Turning to Slide 4, as we shared with you in June, we are extremely excited about PPL\u2019s compelling investment proposition, which is driven by our strategic repositioning. The completion of the sale of our UK Utility business and acquisition of Rhode Island Energy has derisked the company and created a compelling portfolio of domestic regulated utilities. Our company has one of the best operating track records in the industry. And this operating expertise enables us to further optimize our new portfolio to deliver growth and create shareowner value. The result is a strategy and a new business plan that is anchored in operational efficiencies in the near-term, with stronger rate base growth driving our earnings growth later in the decade, with a total capital investment need of at least $27 billion through 2030. This strategy also keeps affordability front and center as we have committed to stay out of rate cases in Kentucky and Rhode Island until at least mid-2025. We expect our optimization strategy to deliver at least $150 million of O&M savings through 2025. I will discuss these savings opportunities in more detail during today\u2019s presentation, but I want to emphasize that these optimization initiatives were the starting point for our new business plan. We believe this is an effective strategy for the company to manage risks associated with high inflation and high commodity costs, which have increased the cost of energy for our customers. At the same time, our plans support top tier EPS and dividend growth of 6% to 8% per year, with levers that mitigate risk and potentially provide upside. These include incremental O&M savings above the targeted $150 million and higher sales growth relative to the assumptions that we modeled in our plan. We also developed the capital investment plans required to deliver a more reliable and resilient network and to advance a clean energy future for our customers, while earning near our allowed returns by 2025. We see potential opportunities to invest more than our $12 billion capital plan over the next 5 years with incremental upside opportunity stemming from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or the IIJA. Importantly, about 55% of our current 5-year CapEx plan is expected to be recovered from riders and formula rates, significantly mitigating regulatory lag and supporting our credit metrics. This positions us to maintain a strong balance sheet, which will fuel organic growth without the need for equity issuances throughout our plan period. We also have an opportunity to lead the clean energy transition as we move through the plan period and begin to make the necessary investments to effectively transition our coal-fired generation fleet in Kentucky. This is a massive opportunity for both customers and shareowners and is a pivotal part of our broader clean energy strategy. In addition to delivering the utilities of the future, utilities that are designed to efficiently enable and manage distributed energy resources and large-scale renewables connected to our networks. We are on the leading edge of these efforts with the work we have done in Pennsylvania and are confident this proven strategy will continue to drive further savings and capital investment opportunities moving forward, even in Pennsylvania where it is already well underway. We have combined this innovative approach with our culture of delivering operational excellence. And we have a superior track record, which we demonstrated with the Pennsylvania playbook slides on our Investor Day call. In summary, we are excited to translate our track record of best-in-class operational excellence into top-tier returns for our shareowners. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months were designed to do just that, and I am confident they will. We have hit the ground running with the new PPL. My team and I are ready and committed to deliver for our customers and our shareowners. Turning to Slide 5 and the highlights of our second quarter results. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.16 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.30 per share compared with $0.19 per share a year ago. The strong second quarter earnings have us solidly on track to achieve the earnings guidance we shared during our Investor Day. And today, we reaffirmed our 2022 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share with a midpoint of $1.37 per share. This forecast reflects a partial year estimate of contributions from Rhode Island Energy following our completion of the acquisition on May 25. Today, we also reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2025. Our per-share growth target is based off the midpoint of our 2022 pro forma forecast range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share or $1.48 per share. The pro forma forecast range reflects a full year of earnings contributions from Rhode Island Energy. In addition to delivering strong quarterly results, we have also been hard at work, enabling the asset optimization and centralization plans that will drive our O&M savings targets. I will discuss the details of these initiatives on the next slide. The final major highlight, I\u2019ll note this morning is the RFP that LG&E and KU recently issued for replacement generation in Kentucky. As a reminder, the companies expect to retire at least 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation by 2028. The RFP is open to a variety of generation sources, which I will touch on further in a few minutes. Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our strategy moving forward focuses on efficiency and affordability, as we build the networks and make the investments necessary to deliver a clean energy future. Today, we are providing more detail on the savings opportunities that support our strategy. We expect to deliver $50 million to $60 million or about a third of the savings target in 2023. As our investments in technology take shape, we expect the savings to step up to a cumulative total of $120 million to $130 million by the end of 2024, achieving the full $150 million of targeted savings by the end of 2025. The timing and ranges reflect our planned implementation of various systems and processes, including the further use of data science to become more efficient. Turning to the right side of the slide, there are two key areas to this optimization strategy, operations and shared services. Regarding operations, the first piece is replicating our Pennsylvania playbook for electric T&D operations across Kentucky and Rhode Island, which we expect will drive about $80 million of savings by 2025. To accomplish this objective, we will deploy smart grid technology to enhance reliability and reduce costs and leverage data science to maximize our resource allocation. We are also improving our vegetation management approach, leveraging models and satellite imagery to assess individual predictions of risk, such as when a tree canopy is expected to reach a certain power line, it will need to be trimmed or cut down. We have spent several years honing our PA playbook and we\u2019ve built our electric T&D operating model to be scalable. Over the past decade, we grew our Pennsylvania rate base and earnings at about 10% a year, all while keeping O&M relatively flat, offsetting about $100 million of inflation over that period and driving significant improvements in reliability and customer satisfaction. At the same time, we built one of the nation\u2019s most advanced energy network, one that incorporates self-healing technology and supports the growth of renewable energy. We believe the best is yet to come as we replicate our PA playbook enterprise-wide, with additional upside as we continue to find ways to scale technology and drive further innovation. Another key source of O&M savings in our T&D operations will be the opportunity to leverage advanced technologies and our customer service function. This includes expanding and improving convenient self-service options for customers that reduces call handling and improves customer satisfaction. We\u2019re also projecting lower O&M in other areas of our operations, including the generation and gas LDC businesses, totaling about $35 million by 2025. We see the majority of this opportunity through greater efficiency in our generation fleet, including outage optimization and coal plant retirements. The second area of focus is the centralization of shared services, which includes the consolidation of our supply chain function and IT systems and platforms. We expect to drive savings in this area of about $35 million by 2025. By deploying common systems and platforms across our operations, we expect to reduce software and licensing costs and improve overall operating efficiency. This also includes leveraging our increased buying power from centralized supply chain operations to procure equipment and materials enterprise-wide, as well as other savings from consolidating our other shared services functions. In summary, we believe our strategy, which leverages operating efficiency, data science and advanced technology, differentiates PPL by supporting competitive earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8%, while remaining focused on affordability as we make the investments needed to deliver the clean energy transition. We\u2019re confident we will achieve our O&M reduction targets, as they are driven by a proven operating model, are technology driven and are spread over several areas of the business over several years, with achievable targets and plans in each area. Turning to Slide 7. We continue to evaluate opportunities to advance the transition of our Kentucky generation fleet, which presents an exceptional investment opportunity. Under our current plan, we expect to retire 1,000 megawatts of coal by 2028 and an additional 1,000 megawatts by 2035. As we plan for the future, we continue to evaluate supply options and technologies that will best deliver value for our customers over the long-term, while advancing cleaner sources and maintaining secure, reliable and low-cost energy in the state, which is key to supporting Kentucky\u2019s robust economic development. As I noted earlier, LG&E and KU recently issued an RFP for replacement generation to address potential EPA regulations, load growth, coal plant retirements, and greater diversification of our Kentucky generation portfolio. The RFP is open to a variety of generation sources, including renewables, battery storage and peaking or baseload natural gas. We\u2019re seeking proposals for capacity and energy to be available, no earlier than 2025. Proposals are due in mid-August, and we expect to complete our evaluation by the end of October. This will allow us to submit our required regulatory filings either in Q4 of this year or Q1 of 2023. Results from the RFP will also inform further analysis we\u2019re undertaking regarding the transition of our coal-fired fleet to cleaner sources, based on our continued engagement with shareowners. This analysis will include various clean energy scenarios, including an assessment of the financial and operational implications of achieving an 80% clean energy portfolio by 2030. We expect to complete the analysis and share our results by the end of the year. As you know, we issued two significant reports in the fall of 2021 with our Integrated Resource Plan and Climate Assessment report. This latest analysis, to be completed later this year, reflects our continued evaluation of clean energy transition options. Lastly, on this slide, I would note that we continue to closely monitor the EPA\u2019s proposed regulations for potential impacts to our transition plan, including the Good Neighbor rule. The Good Neighbor rule could potentially advance nearly 500 megawatts of coal-fired retirements from 2034 into the 2026 to 2028 time frame. As a result, we are closely monitoring that regulation, which we expect will become final later this year or in 2023. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, as Vince noted, we reported 2022 second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share. Special items in the second quarter were $0.14 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.30 per share, an improvement of $0.11 per share compared to last year. The strong quarter brings our year-to-date GAAP earnings to $0.53 per share. Adjusting for special items of $0.18 per share, our ongoing earnings results are $0.71 per share through the first half of 2022 compared to $0.47 in the first half of 2021. As Vince mentioned, these results put us firmly on track to achieve our 2022 earnings forecast of $1.30 to $1.45 per share. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers on Slide 10, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.03 year-over-year, excluding accretion. The increased earnings in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by higher peak transmission demand and returns on additional capital investments in transmission. Our Kentucky segment also improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year excluding accretion. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, 2021, and higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather. Partially offsetting these increases were higher O&M expenses, primarily due to plant outages and storm restoration costs, and higher depreciation due to additions to PP&E. Our Rhode Island segment earned $0.01 per share for the quarter, reflecting our 1 month of ownership. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year, driven by lower interest expense primarily resulting from the recapitalization of the balance sheet following the sale of WPD. Finally, we experienced $0.01 increase in our second quarter 2022 EPS due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of buybacks completed in 2021. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. As I said at the outset of my remarks, I\u2019m excited about the prospects for the new PPL. Through our strategic transactions, we\u2019ve positioned the company to deliver consistent, sustainable, top-tier returns for our share owners, and exceptional results for our customers. We look forward to seeing many of you during our upcoming marketing events over the next few months, as we continue to share our story. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi. Good morning, Vince. Thanks for the update. Just wanted to kick things off with the Inflation Reduction Act, your peers have kind of talked about implications. Maybe \u2013 I know it\u2019s pretty early, but just what are you thinking of the tax credits \u2013 the generation tax credits and then the impacts on cash taxes of the alternative minimum tax?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, sure. So for the most part, we think the act is positive for the company. First, the ability to elect the production tax credit instead of the ITC for solar will improve economics of our self-build options as we look at renewables as a potential source of replacement generation in Kentucky. In addition, the extension of the renewable tax credit should lower the cost of renewables overall. That will be good for not only our RFP process in Kentucky, but also our customers in Rhode Island as we procure clean energy to meet the 100% renewable energy by 2033 requirement that was just enacted into law up in Rhode Island. As you know, we are now a federal cash taxpayer. So we\u2019re not anticipating the 15% AMT provision to have a significant impact on our business, so no real headwind there. And then I just think the transferability provisions around tax credits, also makes it more likely that renewables will be built. And that will also be good in general for the industry and for accelerating our clean energy transition, simplifies the structure of the deals significantly.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. What effective cash tax rate are you currently at?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Joe, do you want to?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. So I would kind of expect it to be around the 15% range through the planning period.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. Alright. So the EMT is not going to impact the cash flow sort of metrics in the plan. Okay. Then just switching gears to the \u2013 and by the way, thank you for sharing the details on Slide 6 on the O&M trajectory. That\u2019s really helpful by year. Just switching to Slide 7 really quickly on the Kentucky RFP, so what are the next steps in terms of after the regulatory filing that is in Q4 this year or early next year? What do we expect a form of approval for the Commission, or what are the kind of things that we should be watching for?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, there could be various filings that we will need to make. It will really depend, Durgesh, on the generation replacement strategy. So, to the extent we are \u2013 we are going to be building generation. We will need a CPCN for that, and that will go into the Commission. There will be a period of months\u2019 approval process. There is no statutory requirement on that, but it will take some months for the commission to get through that. If it\u2019s through PPAs for renewable energy, those contracts also require approval from the Commission. And so the form of the filings will take shape depending on the ultimate generation source that we come up with in terms of that replacement generation, but both generally will require filings.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And then just one last one, and I will pass the opportunity for others to ask questions. Any of this CapEx coming out of these RFPs would be incremental to your current line, correct?\nVince Sorgi: It\u2019s incremental to the $12 billion in the 5-year CapEx plan. We do have $1 billion to $2 billion of CapEx for generation replacement in the $27 billion that we showed through 2030.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks guys.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: And the next question is from Ryan Greenwald from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRyan Greenwald: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nVince Sorgi: Hi Ryan.\nRyan Greenwald: Good morning. I appreciate the time. Just to maybe piggyback on Durgesh\u2019s question around the IRA. How do you \u2013 how does this kind of influence the way you guys think about unregulated renewables?\nVince Sorgi: I mean obviously, it will help the economics around that business. Again, it\u2019s a very small component of our overall business. So, I don\u2019t see it turning Safari into a material driver of our earnings in the near-term. But obviously, it will simplify the deal structures and make those projects more economic.\nRyan Greenwald: Understood. Thank you. And then any initial expectations on benefits that could accrue to you guys from the recent move by the governor to reduce the tax rate in Pennsylvania and how that could kind of factor into rate case dynamics and how long you guys are able to stay out?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. I will let Joe talk about the specifics on that. I mean the reduction going from 9.99% to 4.99% is over a period of years. I think it concludes in 2031. So, in any 1 year, the impact isn\u2019t too significant. But Joe, do you want to talk to that?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, sure. So, the current corporate income tax rate in Pennsylvania is 9.99%. That\u2019s going to be reduced to 8.99% on January 1, 2023. And then from there, it decreases by 0.5 percentage point annually until it reaches 4.99% in 2031, has been said. So, the impact is not material. I don\u2019t think that it would impact our rate case timing or strategy around that. Certainly, we will have to see what the PUC would do regarding the reduction, but it\u2019s not a material impact to the business.\nVince Sorgi: But it\u2019s good. We are glad to see the reduction in the rate just for general business purposes. It\u2019s good to see for sure.\nRyan Greenwald: Absolutely. I will leave it there. Thanks so much.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: And the next question is from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lapides: Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. I look forward to seeing you next week. I had a question about O&M savings, which is you used the language in today\u2019s slide deck of at least $150 million targeted by 2025. Do you see upside to that $150 million? And if so, kind of where do you think that upside kind of which of the buckets could that emerge from?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, as we have discussed, the \u2013 if you look at the disclosure that we provided on the Investor Day and you take the benchmarking metrics that we had just for the T&D operations, where EU was just outside the top quartile and Kentucky and Rhode Island were in the third quartile. The ability to move Rhode Island and Kentucky to where EU is today and then, of course, we are projecting to move EU into the first quartile, that is worth more than $150 million. In addition to that, we have the generation reductions that we are disclosing today. So the opportunity is more than the $150 million. The $150 million through 2025 is what we believe is achievable through 2025, given the integration efforts that are ongoing in Rhode Island, which takes a significant amount of attention and resources from both our company and National Grid to get all that done in the 2-year timeframe. So, that\u2019s why we have indicated we believe there is further optimization opportunity beyond 2025. And if there is opportunity to extract more than that through 2025, we could see that either being used as a potential offset to inflationary pressures, if that continues to persist, and ultimately has an impact on our plan. To-date, it hasn\u2019t had a material impact. But if that were to shift, we think that upside could help to offset that or it could provide upside to the EPS growth rate.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you for that. And then one question, the Good Neighbor Rule. Can you just walk us through how you think about whether \u2013 if the rule was finalized as proposed by the EPA, and I know we are still in the comment period and so forth, so we have some time. But just curious, how you are thinking about \u2013 does that impact energy that would come from existing coal plants, or do you think more of it as it would drive more of your existing coal plants into retirement and therefore, create a need for both energy and capacity?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, the Good Neighbor Rule is basically the cross-state pollution rule. And so from our perspective, it\u2019s really around back-end technology and the need for \u2013 so we still have a plant that\u2019s scheduled to retire in 2034 that would require some back-end pollution control equipment under this proposed rule. And so Michael, what we would have to do based on the final language in that is determine, write the most economic way to address that regulation. And so it could drive that plant being retired sooner or it could require some other solution, but we really need to wait for that rule to be finalized to determine the best way in which we would address that. But it certainly could drive us potentially to retire that plant sooner than 2034.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And if I think about just the timeline of this, the RFPs that are already underway in Kentucky, probably don\u2019t address the incremental potential coal retirement that could get moved up that you would either \u2013 if you needed to replace that coal plant, you would either have to host another RFP sometime next year or the following?\nVince Sorgi: I don\u2019t think so. I mean we are getting a number of responses. And so really, I think what you are describing is are we replacing 1,000 megawatts or 1,500 megawatts of coal capacity, and we will just stack the responses accordingly to come up with the most economic way to address either 1,000 megawatts or 1,500 megawatts. So, that\u2019s how we are thinking about it. I don\u2019t think we would have to run another RFP.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And the incremental megawatts is just an extra 500 megawatts?\nVince Sorgi: It\u2019s just shy of 500 megawatts, is the capacity of that plant.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hi Gregg.\nGregg Orrill: Hey. Thank you. Just a follow-up on if you might be able to do at a state what the Pennsylvania regulatory strategy is, or do you have a rate case that you are thinking about?\nVince Sorgi: So, as I think Joe discussed on our Investor Day call, we don\u2019t have an imminent rate case in the plan for Pennsylvania. That is something we always look at when we look at all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we have committed to staying out of base rate cases both in Rhode Island and Kentucky, at least until mid-2025. We do not have that commitment in Pennsylvania. Again, based on the optimization strategy, we think we can hold off a bit in PA, but that\u2019s something that we are always looking at when the best time to go in is. So, just to reiterate what Joe said, we don\u2019t have anything imminent in the plan.\nGregg Orrill: Alright. Thanks. Congratulations.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks Gregg.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks everyone for joining the call and we look forward to seeing many of you as we are out doing marketing over the next couple of months. So, thanks again for joining.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Turning to Slide 4, as we shared with you in June, we are extremely excited about PPL's compelling investment proposition, which is driven by our strategic repositioning. The completion of the sale of our UK Utility business and acquisition of Rhode Island Energy has derisked the company and created a compelling portfolio of domestic regulated utilities. Our company has one of the best operating track records in the industry. And this operating expertise enables us to further optimize our new portfolio to deliver growth and create shareowner value. The result is a strategy and a new business plan that is anchored in operational efficiencies in the near-term, with stronger rate base growth driving our earnings growth later in the decade, with a total capital investment need of at least $27 billion through 2030. This strategy also keeps affordability front and center as we have committed to stay out of rate cases in Kentucky and Rhode Island until at least mid-2025. We expect our optimization strategy to deliver at least $150 million of O&M savings through 2025. I will discuss these savings opportunities in more detail during today's presentation, but I want to emphasize that these optimization initiatives were the starting point for our new business plan. We believe this is an effective strategy for the company to manage risks associated with high inflation and high commodity costs, which have increased the cost of energy for our customers. At the same time, our plans support top tier EPS and dividend growth of 6% to 8% per year, with levers that mitigate risk and potentially provide upside. These include incremental O&M savings above the targeted $150 million and higher sales growth relative to the assumptions that we modeled in our plan. We also developed the capital investment plans required to deliver a more reliable and resilient network and to advance a clean energy future for our customers, while earning near our allowed returns by 2025. We see potential opportunities to invest more than our $12 billion capital plan over the next 5 years with incremental upside opportunity stemming from the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or the IIJA. Importantly, about 55% of our current 5-year CapEx plan is expected to be recovered from riders and formula rates, significantly mitigating regulatory lag and supporting our credit metrics. This positions us to maintain a strong balance sheet, which will fuel organic growth without the need for equity issuances throughout our plan period. We also have an opportunity to lead the clean energy transition as we move through the plan period and begin to make the necessary investments to effectively transition our coal-fired generation fleet in Kentucky. This is a massive opportunity for both customers and shareowners and is a pivotal part of our broader clean energy strategy. In addition to delivering the utilities of the future, utilities that are designed to efficiently enable and manage distributed energy resources and large-scale renewables connected to our networks. We are on the leading edge of these efforts with the work we have done in Pennsylvania and are confident this proven strategy will continue to drive further savings and capital investment opportunities moving forward, even in Pennsylvania where it is already well underway. We have combined this innovative approach with our culture of delivering operational excellence. And we have a superior track record, which we demonstrated with the Pennsylvania playbook slides on our Investor Day call. In summary, we are excited to translate our track record of best-in-class operational excellence into top-tier returns for our shareowners. The actions we have taken over the past 18 months were designed to do just that, and I am confident they will. We have hit the ground running with the new PPL. My team and I are ready and committed to deliver for our customers and our shareowners. Turning to Slide 5 and the highlights of our second quarter results. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.16 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.30 per share compared with $0.19 per share a year ago. The strong second quarter earnings have us solidly on track to achieve the earnings guidance we shared during our Investor Day. And today, we reaffirmed our 2022 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share with a midpoint of $1.37 per share. This forecast reflects a partial year estimate of contributions from Rhode Island Energy following our completion of the acquisition on May 25. Today, we also reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2025. Our per-share growth target is based off the midpoint of our 2022 pro forma forecast range of $1.40 to $1.55 per share or $1.48 per share. The pro forma forecast range reflects a full year of earnings contributions from Rhode Island Energy. In addition to delivering strong quarterly results, we have also been hard at work, enabling the asset optimization and centralization plans that will drive our O&M savings targets. I will discuss the details of these initiatives on the next slide. The final major highlight, I'll note this morning is the RFP that LG&E and KU recently issued for replacement generation in Kentucky. As a reminder, the companies expect to retire at least 1,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation by 2028.

We look forward to seeing many of you during our upcoming marketing events over the next few months, as we continue to share our story. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Durgesh. Yes, sure. So for the most part, we think the act is positive for the company. First, the ability to elect the production tax credit instead of the ITC for solar will improve economics of our self-build options as we look at renewables as a potential source of replacement generation in Kentucky.

That will be good for not only our RFP process in Kentucky, but also our customers in Rhode Island as we procure clean energy to meet the 100% renewable energy by 2033 requirement that was just enacted into law up in Rhode Island. As you know, we are now a federal cash taxpayer. So we're not anticipating the 15% AMT provision to have a significant impact on our business, so no real headwind there. And then I just think the transferability provisions around tax credits, also makes it more likely that renewables will be built. And that will also be good in general for the industry and for accelerating our clean energy transition, simplifies the structure of the deals significantly. Yes, Joe, do you want to? Yes. So, there could be various filings that we will need to make. It will really depend, Durgesh, on the generation replacement strategy. So, to the extent we are \u2013 we are going to be building generation. We will need a CPCN for that, and that will go into the Commission. There will be a period of months' approval process. There is no statutory requirement on that, but it will take some months for the commission to get through that. If it's through PPAs for renewable energy, those contracts also require approval from the Commission. And so the form of the filings will take shape depending on the ultimate generation source that we come up with in terms of that replacement generation, but both generally will require filings. It's incremental to the $12 billion in the 5-year CapEx plan. We do have $1 billion to $2 billion of CapEx for generation replacement in the $27 billion that we showed through 2030. Sure. Hi Ryan. I mean obviously, it will help the economics around that business. Again, it's a very small component of our overall business. So, I don't see it turning Safari into a material driver of our earnings in the near-term. But obviously, it will simplify the deal structures and make those projects more economic. Yes. I will let Joe talk about the specifics on that. I mean the reduction going from 9.99% to 4.99% is over a period of years. I think it concludes in 2031. So, in any 1 year, the impact isn't too significant. But Joe, do you want to talk to that? But it's good. We are glad to see the reduction in the rate just for general business purposes. It's good to see for sure. Great. Thanks Ryan. Yes. So, as we have discussed, the \u2013 if you look at the disclosure that we provided on the Investor Day and you take the benchmarking metrics that we had just for the T&D operations, where EU was just outside the top quartile and Kentucky and Rhode Island were in the third quartile. The ability to move Rhode Island and Kentucky to where EU is today and then, of course, we are projecting to move EU into the first quartile, that is worth more than $150 million. In addition to that, we have the generation reductions that we are disclosing today. So the opportunity is more than the $150 million. The $150 million through 2025 is what we believe is achievable through 2025, given the integration efforts that are ongoing in Rhode Island, which takes a significant amount of attention and resources from both our company and National Grid to get all that done in the 2-year timeframe. So, that's why we have indicated we believe there is further optimization opportunity beyond 2025. And if there is opportunity to extract more than that through 2025, we could see that either being used as a potential offset to inflationary pressures, if that continues to persist, and ultimately has an impact on our plan. To-date, it hasn't had a material impact. But if that were to shift, we think that upside could help to offset that or it could provide upside to the EPS growth rate. Yes. So, the Good Neighbor Rule is basically the cross-state pollution rule. And so from our perspective, it's really around back-end technology and the need for \u2013 so we still have a plant that's scheduled to retire in 2034 that would require some back-end pollution control equipment under this proposed rule. And so Michael, what we would have to do based on the final language in that is determine, write the most economic way to address that regulation. And so it could drive that plant being retired sooner or it could require some other solution, but we really need to wait for that rule to be finalized to determine the best way in which we would address that. But it certainly could drive us potentially to retire that plant sooner than 2034. I don't think so. I mean we are getting a number of responses. And so really, I think what you are describing is are we replacing 1,000 megawatts or 1,500 megawatts of coal capacity, and we will just stack the responses accordingly to come up with the most economic way to address either 1,000 megawatts or 1,500 megawatts. So, that's how we are thinking about it. I don't think we would have to run another RFP. It's just shy of 500 megawatts, is the capacity of that plant. Sure. Thanks Michael. Hi Gregg. So, as I think Joe discussed on our Investor Day call, we don't have an imminent rate case in the plan for Pennsylvania. That is something we always look at when we look at all of our jurisdictions. Of course, we have committed to staying out of base rate cases both in Rhode Island and Kentucky, at least until mid-2025. We do not have that commitment in Pennsylvania. Again, based on the optimization strategy, we think we can hold off a bit in PA, but that's something that we are always looking at when the best time to go in is. So, just to reiterate what Joe said, we don't have anything imminent in the plan. Great. Thanks Gregg. Great. Thanks everyone for joining the call and we look forward to seeing many of you as we are out doing marketing over the next couple of months. So, thanks again for joining."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9, as Vince noted, we reported 2022 second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.16 per share. Special items in the second quarter were $0.14 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.30 per share, an improvement of $0.11 per share compared to last year. The strong quarter brings our year-to-date GAAP earnings to $0.53 per share. Adjusting for special items of $0.18 per share, our ongoing earnings results are $0.71 per share through the first half of 2022 compared to $0.47 in the first half of 2021. As Vince mentioned, these results put us firmly on track to achieve our 2022 earnings forecast of $1.30 to $1.45 per share. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers on Slide 10, our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results improved by $0.03 year-over-year, excluding accretion. The increased earnings in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by higher peak transmission demand and returns on additional capital investments in transmission. Our Kentucky segment also improved by $0.03 per share year-over-year excluding accretion. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, 2021, and higher sales volumes, primarily due to favorable weather. Partially offsetting these increases were higher O&M expenses, primarily due to plant outages and storm restoration costs, and higher depreciation due to additions to PP&E. Our Rhode Island segment earned $0.01 per share for the quarter, reflecting our 1 month of ownership. Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year, driven by lower interest expense primarily resulting from the recapitalization of the balance sheet following the sale of WPD. Finally, we experienced $0.01 increase in our second quarter 2022 EPS due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of buybacks completed in 2021. That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yes. So I would kind of expect it to be around the 15% range through the planning period. Yes, sure. So, the current corporate income tax rate in Pennsylvania is 9.99%. That's going to be reduced to 8.99% on January 1, 2023. And then from there, it decreases by 0.5 percentage point annually until it reaches 4.99% in 2031, has been said. So, the impact is not material. I don't think that it would impact our rate case timing or strategy around that. Certainly, we will have to see what the PUC would do regarding the reduction, but it's not a material impact to the business."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the PPL Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nAndrew Ludwig: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the PPL Corporation Conference Call on First Quarter 2022 Financial Results. We provided slides for this presentation in our earnings release issued this morning on the Investors section of our website.  Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.  We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix.  Participating on our call this morning are Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer; and Greg Dudkin, Chief Operating Officer.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with highlights of our first quarter performance and an update on the status of our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island. Joe will then provide a detailed review of first quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share compared with $0.28 per share a year ago. These results were in line with our expectations and provide a strong start to the year as we remain focused on repositioning PPL for long-term growth and success.  Moving to Rhode Island, we received approval in late February from the Rhode Island division of Public Utilities and Carriers to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. In its detailed decision, the division found that PPL met the statutory standard for approval.  The Rhode Island Attorney General's office appealed the division's order to the state's Superior Court and obtained a stay of the approval until the appeal could be heard.  On April 26, the superior court heard oral arguments on the Attorney General's appeal. The Attorney General contends that the division misapplied the statutory standard for approval and in particular, the state's public interest requirement. The Attorney General also contends that the division failed to adequately consider Rhode Island's act on climate in its analysis decision.  We disagree and believe the extensive record and evidence in this case demonstrate that the division properly applied the statutory standard and correctly approved the transaction.  At the April 26 hearing, the Attorney General's office asked Judge Stern to remand the matter back to the division with instructions to address the issues raised by the Attorney General. The Attorney General's office did not ask the judge to reverse or vacate the decision. We anticipate Judge Stern will issue a decision on the appeal relatively soon because he publicly stated that a quick and timely resolution of this matter is in the best interest of all parties.  In the meantime, we are actively engaged in settlement discussions with the Attorney General's office and remain prepared to close promptly with National Grid. As we've shared all along, we are eager and excited about the opportunity to work with the talented team at Narragansett Electric to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and support the state's decarbonization efforts.  We continue to believe Narragansett Electric is an excellent for PPL and that PPL is an excellent fit for the state of Rhode Island. We remain confident that we will reach a positive outcome in the proceeding.  Given the pending litigation, we are not in a position to provide additional details at this time. And I have said all I can say about this matter on today's call. I appreciate you respecting the process when we get to the Q&A session.  Turning to Slide 5 and a few operational highlights. Our Kentucky Utilities continue to seek opportunities to advance clean energy options and support Kentucky's growing economic development. In late February, LG&E and KU joined the state's new Hydrogen Hub initiative, which focuses on making hydrogen a low-carbon solution for the future. The initiative is part of a new energy strategy announced last fall by Kentucky Governor, Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.  LG&E and KU's commitment to promote hydrogen supports a key pillar of PPL's clean energy strategy, which is to drive digital innovation and R&D to enable new technologies. The commitment is also consistent with our sponsorship of EPRI's Low-Carbon Resources Initiative, and LG&E and KU's partnership with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research. EPRI's Low-Carbon Resources Initiative seeks to advance clean energy technology and low carbon energy carriers such as hydrogen.  Meanwhile, LG&E and KU's carbon capture partnership with the University of Kentucky, includes a novel project focused on capturing CO2 from natural gas combined cycle plants and directly from the air as well as producing hydrogen and oxygen as value-added streams. We're excited to join this new Hydrogen Hub initiative and we will continue to engage with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state's clean energy strategy evolves.  We're also very excited to support continued economic development in Kentucky, which is coming off a banner year for attracting new business and manufacturing in the state. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, Kentucky's success in 2021 included Ford's announcement that it will build a $6 billion battery manufacturing complex within our LG&E and KU service territories. The complex to be built in Glendale, Kentucky will help put the state at the forefront of the auto industry's transformation to electric vehicles, and the state has called it the single-largest economic development project in its history.  In support of this effort in Glendale, Kentucky Utilities recently requested regulatory approval to build 2 345 kv and 2 138 kv power lines and 2 new substations. LG&E plans to construct an interconnection gas regulation facility and nearly half mile of gas lines to serve the Glendale project. The estimated capital cost to support the Glendale economic development project is $150 million to $200 million. The Kentucky Public Service Commission has set a procedural schedule that will support our ability to meet Ford's construction time line.  In addition to these initiatives, we also remain focused on advancing technology and innovation. Each of our utilities were recently recognized for these efforts by EPRI, winning technology transfer awards. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities received this award for application of an adaptive tool, which, through automation, further increases the overall safety, reliability and efficiency of the electric grid. This tool expands on one of the most advanced grids in the nation as we continue to develop a safer, smarter, self-healing grid of the future.  In Kentucky, LG&E and KU were recognized for the use of EPRI's electrification portfolio assessment tool to identify high-impact electrification technologies to reduce natural gas use and related emissions. This technology research project identified more than 1 million-megawatt hours of electrification opportunities for LG&E and KU industrial and commercial customers to reduce emissions and lower costs.  These awards are just another example of our continued efforts to lead in the research and development space while progressing towards our sustainability goals.  Across our businesses, we are also very focused on improving the customer experience by expanding self-service options, and our progress in this area continues to be well received by our customers. In February, PPL Electric Utilities ranked first in J.D. Power's annual Utility Digital Experience Study. The study assesses how customers interact online and through mobile apps with the 36th largest electric, natural gas and water utilities in the U.S.  PPL Electric's score in the study improved significantly in 2022, while the majority of the companies surveyed experienced declining scores. Improving customers' digital experience is yet another way we continue to use technology to drive value for our customers.  Shifting to our final update on Slide 5. We continue to make progress across PPL in advancing key environmental, social and governance initiatives. On April 14, we published our annual sustainability report, which addresses our approach to a wide range of ESG issues and highlights our 2021 performance and progress.  As highlighted in the report, we have expanded on our commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by committing to not burn unabated coal by 2050. This new commitment reflects our continued discussion and expectations around the future of our coal fleet and its transition.  Based on our current retirement schedule, we expect our coal capacity to be reduced from just over 4,700 megawatts today to approximately 550 megawatts in 2050. The 550 megawatts are associated with our highly efficient Trimble County 2 coal-fired facility, which was completed in 2011.  There are any number of technology developments, regulatory mandates or circumstances that could impact the timing of the end of this plant's economic life. We believe that research and development is key to our clean energy future and fully expect that innovation, technological advances and the relative economics of other cleaner energy sources will support the company's commitment to not burn unabated coal at this facility by 2050.  In other highlights from our sustainability report, we created and filled a new Chief Diversity Officer position to lead our DEI strategy enterprise-wide and build on the progress we made in 2021.  Finally, I would note that we have added political contributions to the oversight function of our Board's Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee. PPL's transparent disclosures in this area have earned us a trendsetter ranking by the CPA Zicklin Index, which benchmarks the political disclosures and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. Oversight by the Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee will further strengthen our governance in this area.  That concludes my strategic and operational overview. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe?\nJoseph Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. As Vince noted, we reported 2022 first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.37 per share. Special items in the first quarter were $0.04 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. Adjusting for these items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share.  Turning to the ongoing segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share, a $0.03 year-over-year increase. The improved earnings results in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by higher peak transmission demand, returns on additional capital investments in transmission and higher sales volumes. The increases were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, including higher-than-expected storm costs.  Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.25 per share in the first quarter, $0.07 increase over comparable results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, 2021. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation due to additions to PP&E.  Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other primarily included lower interest expense, primarily resulting from the recapitalization of the balance sheet following the sale of WPD.  Finally, included in the segment results, as reflected on this slide, is a $0.02 increase in our first quarter 2022 EPS due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of buybacks completed in 2021.  That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince for some closing comments.\nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. As I noted earlier in my remarks, we continue to work diligently through the state appeals process in Rhode Island. While the appeal has delayed the closing of the acquisition, we are confident we will complete this transaction, and we look forward to introducing a new PPL, a PPL that is built for the future, an innovative, best-in-class utility operator positioned to deliver competitive earnings and dividend growth, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector, employees to lead the clean energy transition, while keeping energy service affordable and reliable for our customers.  And we continue to look forward to sharing a strategic update, including long-term growth projections at an Investor Day following the Rhode Island closing.  With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: So Vince, starting, I guess, with Rhode Island, if the Superior Court rules in favor -- in your favor, I guess, the AG could appeal to the state Supreme Court. Any general thoughts on timing if that were to occur? Is it an immediate filing? And then would you wait for the court to deny your stay? I assume you would not close while this process is still underway, right?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, Shar. Let me just reiterate that we are in active litigation in Rhode Island. And as I said, we're engaged in settling discussions with the Rhode Island AG's office. So I really can't say any more than what I've already said in my prepared remarks.  I'll just reiterate that we're confident that we'll close the transaction in a timely fashion and again, look forward to rolling out the new PPL at an Investor Day shortly following the close. But look, I appreciate that you may have some questions about the matter, but I really need you to respect where we are in this process.\nShahriar Pourreza: No, that's fair. I appreciate that. And then just maybe a question for Joe on housekeeping. Can you just remind us on what the approximate unallocated cash balance is at this point, following the buybacks, which you just highlighted in the 3Q CapEx increase that you had? I guess how are you thinking about the toggle between buybacks and more CapEx as we approach the finish line here in Rhode Island?\nJoseph Bergstein: Yes. So Shar, we'll lay out all the details at the Investor Day when we have it. I mean clearly, we have cash available for the acquisition of NECO when we conclude that process. But anything beyond that, we'll discuss at the Investor Day.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Got it. And then just one last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue. It's just as we're thinking about the Analyst Day, the topic of Kentucky does pop up here and there. And obviously, there's a trajectory that's out there with the prior IRP that's filed. But is there an opportunity to maybe take a slightly more aggressive approach as you're thinking about the coal outlook within that state versus what you just recently filed?\nVincent Sorgi: Well, I'll just say that at the Investor Day, we'll provide a comprehensive update on the company's outlook, our strategy -- and again, we're calling it the new PPL for a reason, Shar. So I know it's been a while since we've had some detailed financial projections out there, but we're really looking forward to laying all of this out for the market. It will provide the investment opportunities in each of the jurisdictions, where we see the near-term and long-term growth going and really, how that translates into our earnings and dividend growth projections. So we'll cover all of that at the Investor Day for sure.\nShahriar Pourreza: No, that's helpful. I mean I think there's some trepidations around what the base earnings could be and what you would grow off of that. So it would be very welcome.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. I'll just say, look, we're focused on growing -- having our earnings growth very competitive, and we'll lay all that out at Investor Day. We're confident we're going to deliver.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicholas Campanella from Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: I just wanted to follow up on Kentucky actually again and just thinking through the portfolio and the amount of undepreciated book value that's kind of still in rate base today. Can you -- I don't know if you would be able to kind of quantify that now or not, but that would be helpful.  And then just thinking through the options for long-term retirements or even any potential acceleration, can you just discuss the framework that's in place there because I believe it's changed since you came out of the most recent rate case there?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So on the retirements, we have the 2024 retirement and then additional retirements in 2028 and then the next round are in kind of the mid-2030s as outlined in the IRP. We are actively engaged with the commission and other parties responding to questions around the IRP. But as we think about really the 2028 retirements going from kind of the theoretical that was in the IRP, again, that's a point in time analysis, to actually putting together the generation replacement plan, we're actively working on that now. That will become part of the interaction that we have with various stakeholders around the IRP. Ultimately, that will culminate in a CPCN probably within the next year around what we think that generation replacement will look like.  But Nick, to your point, there's opportunity to look at those retirement dates and potentially pull those in, but those will all be part of the CPCN request that we'll be working on here in the near term.  Joe, anything you want to add on the rest of his question?\nJoseph Bergstein: I think, Nick, the other part of your question was the current rate base and that's -- that was the other part of your question. That's about $5 billion today.\nNicholas Campanella: Okay, $5 billion. I appreciate that. And then just core business today, what are you seeing in terms of just inflation impacts? How are you feeling on labor pressures, financing costs and just how should we kind of be thinking about how that affects the base business today?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Well it's certainly an area that we're keeping an eye on. In both PA and Kentucky, we've seen some increase in prices due to inflation. However, we expect to be able to manage that. Really, where you're seeing the largest impact of inflation is on the cost of energy. So the energy purchases, the fuel purchases. And even though they don't necessarily impact the P&L because those are pass-through costs, they certainly impact affordability for our customers and that continues to be a key area that we're focused on in ensuring that our energy remains affordable for our customers.  So one of the key aspects of our business plan, and we'll get into a lot more detail on this at the Investor Day, is to drive efficiency across the entire business. Some of the -- parts of that strategy are centralizing our shared services functions. We're further leveraging our supply chain function and as we talked about, continuing to use technology and work optimization to reduce our overall cost.  On the affordability side, in addition to just maintaining and driving efficiency across the enterprise on the cost side, we are very focused on ensuring that our customers are aware of all the programs that are available to them as they think about paying their utility bills and we'll likely need to provide flexible payment plans to our customers just like we did during the pandemic.  So all of these activities, Nick, we think are going to serve us well in this inflationary environment as, again, we continue to look to maintain affordability for our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research.\nSteven Fleishman: One brief one. Just when you talk to a competitive earnings and dividend growth rate, I would say the average in the sector right now is 5% to 7% generally. Is that kind of a fair reflection of what you see as the average in the sector?\nVincent Sorgi: Sorry, Steve, you cut out when you stated your range or number. Say it again.\nSteven Fleishman: 5% to 7% generally viewed as the average, I'd say right now. Is that kind of the bogey that you would be looking to?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Well, that's consistent with what we see as well, yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Vince, tough outcome on Tuesday. So hopefully, get better luck tonight. Just, I guess, quickly on, I guess, Slide 4. And I don't know if you could answer this, and if you can't, just please tell me, but on one of the bullets you highlighted the Attorney General is requesting just, I guess, remand with instruction versus vacating the approval decision. I guess what is the distinction there that you're trying to make on that bullet?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So Anthony, that just means that the Attorney General's office is not looking for the judge to strike down in totality the decision that the division made to approve the transaction and then we basically start from scratch. What was requested was that they remand the decision back to the division with instruction to address the issues that the Rhode Island Attorney General's office had. So it's just making reference to what was being requested by the Attorney General's office. It's not a complete redo.\nAnthony Crowdell: So they're -- so am I -- fair to say from that bullet, that there's actually no challenge to actually -- there's no challenge to the DPUC approval, but the DPUC approved the transaction, and right now, there's no pending legal, I guess, matter that's challenging that approval that DPUC gave?\nVincent Sorgi: No. No, as I said in my prepared remarks, really the 2 issues that the Attorney General's office is challenging within the decision is whether or not the act on climate was adequately reviewed and analyzed in providing the approval and then whether the public interest requirement was met. So those were the 2 primary challenges that the Attorney General had around the decision.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then lastly, if I can just pivot, I guess, to maybe Pennsylvania. It's on kind of like customer bill impact and will load growth be impacted. If I think in Pennsylvania, I think customers maybe had an increase in December due to higher commodity prices. And then I believe new rates go into effect in June, so you get a kind of a pancake of maybe a sizable increase. I guess one is, what level of increase are you forecasting customers may face in Pennsylvania in June versus maybe a year ago? And then do you think that could impact either customer load growth looks very attractive when I look on the slides or maybe if it postpones any CapEx, and I'll leave it at that.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. I'll -- Greg, do you want to talk to that? I mean, at a high level, the increases are significant as you're describing. As we know, commodity prices are way up this year versus last year. And again, that's a pass-through cost for us, but it's upwards this year versus last around -- could be as much as 50%, 60%. So it is very significant. We are actively reaching out to our customers to help them, whether it's shopping or as I talked earlier about flexible payment plans, et cetera, so making sure that they have a full suite of options at their disposal.  When you look at the total increase, it's really the generation side, Anthony. I think T&D is actually going down. So it's really a generation issue, but it's certainly an area that we're focused on helping our customers deal with.  But Greg, any further details or insights you have on that?\nGregory Dudkin: Yes. So to Vince's point, compared to June of last year, the overall bill for residential will go up about 30%. And again, it's driven by basically a doubling of the generation costs. So the impact on sales going forward, we'll have to see, but it's -- that's a big impact.  We are really pushing for -- because we're a competitive state, there may be generation providers that have a lower rate than that. So in our communication to customers, we're really pushing for them to go shop. And if there's a lower generation charge or deal out there, they should sign up for it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo: First, I just want to clarify quick with the affordability questions. There's no plans in moderating the capital plans in Pennsylvania or Kentucky that you put out before?\nVincent Sorgi: Well, we'll lay out our new capital plan on the Investor Day, Paul. But specifically related to the old plans, they're not being impacted by that.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. I just wanted to check on that. And then just since all the inflation questions, what is the long-term O&M targets for Pennsylvania and Kentucky, just as you're seeing more pressures change the rate case plans in Pennsylvania?\nVincent Sorgi: Well, overall, again, we'll get into the details on the Investor Day, but as I mentioned, part of our strategy is to become more efficient across the entire enterprise, especially after we close Rhode Island and we're able to really leverage the IT systems that we have here in Pennsylvania around the T&D operations.  As we've talked, we need to just bring Rhode Island on to those systems. They're not coming with systems because they're integrated with National Grid. So we'll be able to take advantage of spreading all the fixed costs of those systems over more customers and more employees.  In addition to that, like I said, we're centralizing our services organizations or functions and looking to even further optimize our supply chain efforts across the entire portfolio. And, again, bringing in the opportunity with Rhode Island will enable us to do that even further. So we see a fairly significant opportunity there to reduce O&M over the planning horizon. And again, we'll lay all that out on the Investor Day, but it's significant.  Greg, anything you want add to that?\nGregory Dudkin: Yes. Just that you had mentioned PPL Electric Utilities, so there's no plans in the immediate future for a rate case there for today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Lapides: Guys, easy question for you. Just curious if -- I thought you had a stay out in Kentucky for a number of years. So if you ramp up capital spend there, do you have to wait until that next case to get cash recovery of it? Or are there mechanisms you can utilize that would enable interim rate increases before that next case? And can you remind me when do you file that next case there?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So last year's rate case, we had a 4-year stay-out provision. We do have the environmental recovery mechanism in Kentucky. So if there are any environmental-related capital spend, that does get recovered, Michael, on a more real-time basis. But just more broadly, we have the DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania. So even while Greg just mentioned, we don't have a base rate case, we do have the DSIC mechanism there.  And then in Rhode Island, they have their capital recovery mechanism as well that does not require base rate cases.  So the plan that we'll lay out in the Investor Day will not rely on any near-term rate cases across the entire portfolio, which we think will differentiate our plan against some of our peers.\nMichael Lapides: Got it. And can you remind me, do you have -- like how much in the way of near term, call it, next 3 to 5 years, coal, ash or ELT-related spend you have to do in Kentucky?\nVincent Sorgi: I think that we'd probably be better off responding to that at the Investor Day. But it's probably still a couple of hundred million over that time period, not as much as what we were showing the prior 5 years or so, Michael, but there's still a little bit to go there.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will be concluding today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Again, first quarter, I think a good start to the year. We remain confident in our ability to close Narragansett and really looking forward to laying out the new PPL for everybody shortly after closing. So appreciate everybody's time.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Yes. So to Vince's point, compared to June of last year, the overall bill for residential will go up about 30%. And again, it's driven by basically a doubling of the generation costs. So the impact on sales going forward, we'll have to see, but it's -- that's a big impact.  We are really pushing for -- because we're a competitive state, there may be generation providers that have a lower rate than that. So in our communication to customers, we're really pushing for them to go shop. And if there's a lower generation charge or deal out there, they should sign up for it. Yes. Just that you had mentioned PPL Electric Utilities, so there's no plans in the immediate future for a rate case there for today."

            "name": "Vincent Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for our first quarter investor update. Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. I'll begin this morning with highlights of our first quarter performance and an update on the status of our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric in Rhode Island. Joe will then provide a detailed review of first quarter financial results. And as always, we'll leave ample time for your questions.  Turning to Slide 4. Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.37 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share compared with $0.28 per share a year ago. These results were in line with our expectations and provide a strong start to the year as we remain focused on repositioning PPL for long-term growth and success.  Moving to Rhode Island, we received approval in late February from the Rhode Island division of Public Utilities and Carriers to acquire Narragansett Electric from National Grid. In its detailed decision, the division found that PPL met the statutory standard for approval.  The Rhode Island Attorney General's office appealed the division's order to the state's Superior Court and obtained a stay of the approval until the appeal could be heard.  On April 26, the superior court heard oral arguments on the Attorney General's appeal. The Attorney General contends that the division misapplied the statutory standard for approval and in particular, the state's public interest requirement. The Attorney General also contends that the division failed to adequately consider Rhode Island's act on climate in its analysis decision.  We disagree and believe the extensive record and evidence in this case demonstrate that the division properly applied the statutory standard and correctly approved the transaction.  At the April 26 hearing, the Attorney General's office asked Judge Stern to remand the matter back to the division with instructions to address the issues raised by the Attorney General. The Attorney General's office did not ask the judge to reverse or vacate the decision. We anticipate Judge Stern will issue a decision on the appeal relatively soon because he publicly stated that a quick and timely resolution of this matter is in the best interest of all parties.  In the meantime, we are actively engaged in settlement discussions with the Attorney General's office and remain prepared to close promptly with National Grid. As we've shared all along, we are eager and excited about the opportunity to work with the talented team at Narragansett Electric to drive significant value for Rhode Island customers and support the state's decarbonization efforts.  We continue to believe Narragansett Electric is an excellent for PPL and that PPL is an excellent fit for the state of Rhode Island. We remain confident that we will reach a positive outcome in the proceeding.  Given the pending litigation, we are not in a position to provide additional details at this time. And I have said all I can say about this matter on today's call. I appreciate you respecting the process when we get to the Q&A session.  Turning to Slide 5 and a few operational highlights. Our Kentucky Utilities continue to seek opportunities to advance clean energy options and support Kentucky's growing economic development. In late February, LG&E and KU joined the state's new Hydrogen Hub initiative, which focuses on making hydrogen a low-carbon solution for the future. The initiative is part of a new energy strategy announced last fall by Kentucky Governor, Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet.  LG&E and KU's commitment to promote hydrogen supports a key pillar of PPL's clean energy strategy, which is to drive digital innovation and R&D to enable new technologies. The commitment is also consistent with our sponsorship of EPRI's Low-Carbon Resources Initiative, and LG&E and KU's partnership with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research. EPRI's Low-Carbon Resources Initiative seeks to advance clean energy technology and low carbon energy carriers such as hydrogen.  Meanwhile, LG&E and KU's carbon capture partnership with the University of Kentucky, includes a novel project focused on capturing CO2 from natural gas combined cycle plants and directly from the air as well as producing hydrogen and oxygen as value-added streams. We're excited to join this new Hydrogen Hub initiative and we will continue to engage with the Kentucky administration and other stakeholders as the state's clean energy strategy evolves.  We're also very excited to support continued economic development in Kentucky, which is coming off a banner year for attracting new business and manufacturing in the state. As we highlighted on our third quarter call, Kentucky's success in 2021 included Ford's announcement that it will build a $6 billion battery manufacturing complex within our LG&E and KU service territories. The complex to be built in Glendale, Kentucky will help put the state at the forefront of the auto industry's transformation to electric vehicles, and the state has called it the single-largest economic development project in its history.  In support of this effort in Glendale, Kentucky Utilities recently requested regulatory approval to build 2 345 kv and 2 138 kv power lines and 2 new substations. LG&E plans to construct an interconnection gas regulation facility and nearly half mile of gas lines to serve the Glendale project. The estimated capital cost to support the Glendale economic development project is $150 million to $200 million. The Kentucky Public Service Commission has set a procedural schedule that will support our ability to meet Ford's construction time line.  In addition to these initiatives, we also remain focused on advancing technology and innovation. Each of our utilities were recently recognized for these efforts by EPRI, winning technology transfer awards. In Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities received this award for application of an adaptive tool, which, through automation, further increases the overall safety, reliability and efficiency of the electric grid. This tool expands on one of the most advanced grids in the nation as we continue to develop a safer, smarter, self-healing grid of the future.  In Kentucky, LG&E and KU were recognized for the use of EPRI's electrification portfolio assessment tool to identify high-impact electrification technologies to reduce natural gas use and related emissions. This technology research project identified more than 1 million-megawatt hours of electrification opportunities for LG&E and KU industrial and commercial customers to reduce emissions and lower costs.  These awards are just another example of our continued efforts to lead in the research and development space while progressing towards our sustainability goals.  Across our businesses, we are also very focused on improving the customer experience by expanding self-service options, and our progress in this area continues to be well received by our customers. In February, PPL Electric Utilities ranked first in J.D. Power's annual Utility Digital Experience Study. The study assesses how customers interact online and through mobile apps with the 36th largest electric, natural gas and water utilities in the U.S.  PPL Electric's score in the study improved significantly in 2022, while the majority of the companies surveyed experienced declining scores. Improving customers' digital experience is yet another way we continue to use technology to drive value for our customers.  Shifting to our final update on Slide 5. We continue to make progress across PPL in advancing key environmental, social and governance initiatives. On April 14, we published our annual sustainability report, which addresses our approach to a wide range of ESG issues and highlights our 2021 performance and progress.  As highlighted in the report, we have expanded on our commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by committing to not burn unabated coal by 2050. This new commitment reflects our continued discussion and expectations around the future of our coal fleet and its transition.  Based on our current retirement schedule, we expect our coal capacity to be reduced from just over 4,700 megawatts today to approximately 550 megawatts in 2050. The 550 megawatts are associated with our highly efficient Trimble County 2 coal-fired facility, which was completed in 2011.  There are any number of technology developments, regulatory mandates or circumstances that could impact the timing of the end of this plant's economic life. We believe that research and development is key to our clean energy future and fully expect that innovation, technological advances and the relative economics of other cleaner energy sources will support the company's commitment to not burn unabated coal at this facility by 2050.  In other highlights from our sustainability report, we created and filled a new Chief Diversity Officer position to lead our DEI strategy enterprise-wide and build on the progress we made in 2021.  Finally, I would note that we have added political contributions to the oversight function of our Board's Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee. PPL's transparent disclosures in this area have earned us a trendsetter ranking by the CPA Zicklin Index, which benchmarks the political disclosures and accountability policies and practices of leading U.S. public companies. Oversight by the Governance, Nominating and Sustainability Committee will further strengthen our governance in this area.  That concludes my strategic and operational overview. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Joe? Thank you, Joe. As I noted earlier in my remarks, we continue to work diligently through the state appeals process in Rhode Island. While the appeal has delayed the closing of the acquisition, we are confident we will complete this transaction, and we look forward to introducing a new PPL, a PPL that is built for the future, an innovative, best-in-class utility operator positioned to deliver competitive earnings and dividend growth, backed by one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector, employees to lead the clean energy transition, while keeping energy service affordable and reliable for our customers.  And we continue to look forward to sharing a strategic update, including long-term growth projections at an Investor Day following the Rhode Island closing.  With that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A. Yes, Shar. Let me just reiterate that we are in active litigation in Rhode Island. And as I said, we're engaged in settling discussions with the Rhode Island AG's office. So I really can't say any more than what I've already said in my prepared remarks.  I'll just reiterate that we're confident that we'll close the transaction in a timely fashion and again, look forward to rolling out the new PPL at an Investor Day shortly following the close. But look, I appreciate that you may have some questions about the matter, but I really need you to respect where we are in this process. Well, I'll just say that at the Investor Day, we'll provide a comprehensive update on the company's outlook, our strategy -- and again, we're calling it the new PPL for a reason, Shar. So I know it's been a while since we've had some detailed financial projections out there, but we're really looking forward to laying all of this out for the market. It will provide the investment opportunities in each of the jurisdictions, where we see the near-term and long-term growth going and really, how that translates into our earnings and dividend growth projections. So we'll cover all of that at the Investor Day for sure. Yes. I'll just say, look, we're focused on growing -- having our earnings growth very competitive, and we'll lay all that out at Investor Day. We're confident we're going to deliver. Yes. So on the retirements, we have the 2024 retirement and then additional retirements in 2028 and then the next round are in kind of the mid-2030s as outlined in the IRP. We are actively engaged with the commission and other parties responding to questions around the IRP. But as we think about really the 2028 retirements going from kind of the theoretical that was in the IRP, again, that's a point in time analysis, to actually putting together the generation replacement plan, we're actively working on that now. That will become part of the interaction that we have with various stakeholders around the IRP. Ultimately, that will culminate in a CPCN probably within the next year around what we think that generation replacement will look like.  But Nick, to your point, there's opportunity to look at those retirement dates and potentially pull those in, but those will all be part of the CPCN request that we'll be working on here in the near term.  Joe, anything you want to add on the rest of his question? Yes. Well it's certainly an area that we're keeping an eye on. In both PA and Kentucky, we've seen some increase in prices due to inflation. However, we expect to be able to manage that. Really, where you're seeing the largest impact of inflation is on the cost of energy. So the energy purchases, the fuel purchases. And even though they don't necessarily impact the P&L because those are pass-through costs, they certainly impact affordability for our customers and that continues to be a key area that we're focused on in ensuring that our energy remains affordable for our customers.  So one of the key aspects of our business plan, and we'll get into a lot more detail on this at the Investor Day, is to drive efficiency across the entire business. Some of the -- parts of that strategy are centralizing our shared services functions. We're further leveraging our supply chain function and as we talked about, continuing to use technology and work optimization to reduce our overall cost.  On the affordability side, in addition to just maintaining and driving efficiency across the enterprise on the cost side, we are very focused on ensuring that our customers are aware of all the programs that are available to them as they think about paying their utility bills and we'll likely need to provide flexible payment plans to our customers just like we did during the pandemic.  So all of these activities, Nick, we think are going to serve us well in this inflationary environment as, again, we continue to look to maintain affordability for our customers. Sorry, Steve, you cut out when you stated your range or number. Say it again. Yes. Well, that's consistent with what we see as well, yes. Yes. So Anthony, that just means that the Attorney General's office is not looking for the judge to strike down in totality the decision that the division made to approve the transaction and then we basically start from scratch. What was requested was that they remand the decision back to the division with instruction to address the issues that the Rhode Island Attorney General's office had. So it's just making reference to what was being requested by the Attorney General's office. It's not a complete redo. No. No, as I said in my prepared remarks, really the 2 issues that the Attorney General's office is challenging within the decision is whether or not the act on climate was adequately reviewed and analyzed in providing the approval and then whether the public interest requirement was met. So those were the 2 primary challenges that the Attorney General had around the decision. Yes. I'll -- Greg, do you want to talk to that? I mean, at a high level, the increases are significant as you're describing. As we know, commodity prices are way up this year versus last year. And again, that's a pass-through cost for us, but it's upwards this year versus last around -- could be as much as 50%, 60%. So it is very significant. We are actively reaching out to our customers to help them, whether it's shopping or as I talked earlier about flexible payment plans, et cetera, so making sure that they have a full suite of options at their disposal.  When you look at the total increase, it's really the generation side, Anthony. I think T&D is actually going down. So it's really a generation issue, but it's certainly an area that we're focused on helping our customers deal with.  But Greg, any further details or insights you have on that? Well, we'll lay out our new capital plan on the Investor Day, Paul. But specifically related to the old plans, they're not being impacted by that. Well, overall, again, we'll get into the details on the Investor Day, but as I mentioned, part of our strategy is to become more efficient across the entire enterprise, especially after we close Rhode Island and we're able to really leverage the IT systems that we have here in Pennsylvania around the T&D operations.  As we've talked, we need to just bring Rhode Island on to those systems. They're not coming with systems because they're integrated with National Grid. So we'll be able to take advantage of spreading all the fixed costs of those systems over more customers and more employees.  In addition to that, like I said, we're centralizing our services organizations or functions and looking to even further optimize our supply chain efforts across the entire portfolio. And, again, bringing in the opportunity with Rhode Island will enable us to do that even further. So we see a fairly significant opportunity there to reduce O&M over the planning horizon. And again, we'll lay all that out on the Investor Day, but it's significant.  Greg, anything you want add to that? Yes. So last year's rate case, we had a 4-year stay-out provision. We do have the environmental recovery mechanism in Kentucky. So if there are any environmental-related capital spend, that does get recovered, Michael, on a more real-time basis. But just more broadly, we have the DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania. So even while Greg just mentioned, we don't have a base rate case, we do have the DSIC mechanism there.  And then in Rhode Island, they have their capital recovery mechanism as well that does not require base rate cases.  So the plan that we'll lay out in the Investor Day will not rely on any near-term rate cases across the entire portfolio, which we think will differentiate our plan against some of our peers. I think that we'd probably be better off responding to that at the Investor Day. But it's probably still a couple of hundred million over that time period, not as much as what we were showing the prior 5 years or so, Michael, but there's still a little bit to go there. Yes, I just want to thank everybody for joining the call. Again, first quarter, I think a good start to the year. We remain confident in our ability to close Narragansett and really looking forward to laying out the new PPL for everybody shortly after closing. So appreciate everybody's time."

            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our first quarter segment results on Slide 6. As Vince noted, we reported 2022 first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.37 per share. Special items in the first quarter were $0.04 per share, primarily due to integration expenses associated with the planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. Adjusting for these items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.41 per share.  Turning to the ongoing segment drivers. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment earned $0.19 per share, a $0.03 year-over-year increase. The improved earnings results in Pennsylvania were primarily driven by higher peak transmission demand, returns on additional capital investments in transmission and higher sales volumes. The increases were partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense, including higher-than-expected storm costs.  Turning to our Kentucky segment, we earned $0.25 per share in the first quarter, $0.07 increase over comparable results 1 year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher base retail rates effective July 1, 2021. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation due to additions to PP&E.  Results at Corporate and Other were $0.03 higher compared to the prior year. Factors driving earnings results at Corporate and Other primarily included lower interest expense, primarily resulting from the recapitalization of the balance sheet following the sale of WPD.  Finally, included in the segment results, as reflected on this slide, is a $0.02 increase in our first quarter 2022 EPS due to share accretion resulting from the $1 billion of buybacks completed in 2021.  That concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call back over to Vince for some closing comments. Yes. So Shar, we'll lay out all the details at the Investor Day when we have it. I mean clearly, we have cash available for the acquisition of NECO when we conclude that process. But anything beyond that, we'll discuss at the Investor Day. I think, Nick, the other part of your question was the current rate base and that's -- that was the other part of your question. That's about $5 billion today."

I'm excited for today's call as we closed out 2023 in strong fashion and our future continues to look very bright. And I look forward to highlighting why that is on today's call. Turning to Slide 4. I'm very proud of what our PPL team was able to accomplish in 2023. In short, it was a year of challenges met and promises kept. Most importantly, we delivered electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to our more than 3.5 million customers. This included top quartile T&D reliability at each of our utilities, including record reliability for our companies in Kentucky and Rhode Island and top decile performance in Pennsylvania. Our generation reliability in Kentucky was among the very best in the nation. We achieved all this despite heightened storm activity in each of our service territories. At the same time and despite over $0.10 per share impact from mild weather and storms, we delivered on every one of our financial commitments to our shareowners. Namely, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.60 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast by $0.02 and delivering over 8% growth from pro forma 2022. We achieved this through our strong focus on operational efficiency and outperformance in key areas that Joe will cover in his financial review. We also executed $2.4 billion in planned capital spend on time and on budget to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable, and cleaner energy future. We exceeded our annual O&M savings target for 2023 through our strong enterprise-wide focus on technology and business transformation, achieving $75 million in savings from our 2021 baseline, reinforcing our continuous improvement mindset and putting us solidly on track to deliver our targeted $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. These operational and financial achievements were matched by strong results elsewhere in the business that position us for future success. Underpinned by sound planning and effective management of regulatory proceedings, we secured constructive regulatory outcomes in Kentucky and Rhode Island. In Kentucky, we secured approval for about $2 billion in generation replacement investments as part of our CPCN process that concluded in November of last year. The KPSC's decision ensures that we can continue to meet our customers' future energy needs safely, reliably, and affordably, while advancing a cleaner energy mix in the state. And in Rhode Island, we secured approval of our first infrastructure, safety, and reliability plans since acquiring Rhode Island Energy. In addition, we received the green light to deploy advanced metering functionality across Rhode Island, as we lay a foundation for a smarter, more resilient, more reliable, and more dynamic electric grid capable of supporting the state's leading climate goals. Finally, we continue to provide a smooth and seamless transition to PPL ownership for our Rhode Island Energy stakeholders, completing all planned 2023 integration milestones and keeping us on track to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in mid-2024. These achievements are a direct result of our focus on execution, our disciplined investment strategy, our ability to adjust when challenges arise, our experienced leadership team, and clarity of purpose across PPL as we pursue our Utilities of the Future Strategy. Looking ahead, we recognize we still have room to improve as we pursue our vision to be the best utility company in the US. And in 2024, we're determined to make continued progress as we seek to maximize long-term value for both our customers and shareowners. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced the results of our updated business plan, which extends our projected growth outlook through at least 2027. In connection with this update, today, we announced our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. The midpoint of this range, $1.69 per share, represents 7% growth from our 2023 ongoing earnings per share target, consistent with our long-term growth targets. In addition, today, we announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.2575 per share. This represents a 7.3% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and aligns with our commitment to dividend growth in line with our EPS growth targets. We've extended our 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth targets through at least 2027 based off the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast range. In addition to today's updated growth forecast, our updated capital plan includes $14.3 billion from 2024 to 2027 to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability. The new plan is expected to drive average annual rate base growth of 6.3% through 2027, up from the prior growth rate of 5.6%. We plan to fund these additional investments supported by our exceptional balance sheet as our credit metrics remain well within our targets throughout the planned period without the need for equity issuances through at least 2027. As I highlighted in my recap of 2023, we've made outstanding progress towards our multiyear target of at least $175 million in annual O&M savings by 2026. Based on the progress we made last year, we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2024 targeted savings of $120 million to $130 million. In terms of rate case timing in the plan, we do not anticipate any base rate case filings in 2024 in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, or Rhode Island. Looking beyond 2024, our current projections would have us filing a base rate case a bit sooner in Kentucky than previously anticipated due to several factors, including the CPCN decision and additional capital investment needs on the T&D side of the business. Currently, we believe the earliest we would file a rate case in Kentucky will be in the first half of 2025. For Rhode Island, the earliest we would file is late 2025, which is consistent with the prior plan. Finally, in Pennsylvania, recall that we have not been in for a base rate case since 2015 and we have no plans to go in again before 2026 at the earliest. The DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania has operated as designed to support long-term infrastructure investment between rate cases. We do see an increased need to invest more to improve reliability on the distribution system and filed with the Pennsylvania PUC a request to modify our long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP, which includes an increase in planned DSIC eligible investment over a five-year period. We are considering filing a waiver request with the Pennsylvania PUC in the near future, requesting modifications to the DSIC mechanism to support accelerated replacement of aging infrastructure. As always, our focus is on maintaining affordability for our customers. And we will continue to evaluate the need for future rate cases based on a variety of factors, including capital plans, interest rates, market conditions, and regulatory lag. Turning to Slide 6. Our updated plan and business outlook supports our Utilities of the Future Strategy, which is core to everything we do. What does that mean to us? It means updating our design criteria and continuing to harden our transmission and distribution systems to protect against climate change and keep our systems and data secure again cyber threats. It means expanding our industry-leading use of technology, including smart grids, automation, data analytics, AI, and technologies that haven't even been invented yet to build a self-healing grid. It means investing in R&D to drive innovation to advance technologies that can be scaled safely, reliably, and affordably to meet our customers' evolving energy needs and to actually achieve net zero. Like the carbon capture project that was awarded a $72 million DOE grant at our Cane Run combined cycle plant in Kentucky. At the same time, it means expanding transmission and incorporating grid-enhancing technologies to connect more renewables and improve reliability for our customers; advancing a cleaner generation mix, while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable; expanding our ability to reliably manage two-way power flows on the distribution network as we connect significant more distributed energy; driving operational efficiencies to support an affordable clean energy transition; partnering with our customers and state and local officials to enable growth and economic development in our communities; and lastly, expanding self-service options for our customers using digital tools to enhance the customer experience. Turning to Slide 7. As you can hear, creating the Utilities of the Future requires change across our entire business, and it requires significant investments to support a net zero economy. The industry and others are projecting a 200% to 300% increase in electricity demand, which will require additions of reliable generation unless we see unprecedented amounts of energy conservation. At the same time, aging fossil fuel plants in this country are being retired very rapidly without replacements of reliable, dispatchable generation capacity. And considering that fossil fuel generation represents more than 50% of our total capacity in the US, that presents a potentially major problem if this transition is not managed appropriately. The math simply doesn't add up when we don't have proven, scalable technology currently available to actually achieve net zero carbon emissions that customers can afford. Most technologies used in our industry took 40 years to commercialize from the demonstration phase. We need to cut that timeframe in half, at least to meet net zero by 2050 targets, especially as we think about the big four new potential technologies, nuclear SMRs, carbon capture and sequestration, long-duration energy storage, and hydrogen. In the meantime, we need to leverage commercially viable resources that exist today to reduce our carbon footprint, while maintaining reliability. Those that are dispatchable, can ramp up and down quickly and are vital to balancing the gaps left on the system by intermittent renewables. That is why natural gas generation is the key to achieving deep decarbonization in this country and it actually allows us to deploy more renewables than we would otherwise be able to do because of the reliability benefits of natural gas. In a nutshell, this is what makes the energy transition such a challenge being able to deliver the clean energy future in a way that maintains reliability and affordability for our customers. However, with every challenge brings opportunity. And that's why we know our Utilities of the Future strategy is the right approach for this dynamic energy landscape. It's why our generation transition plan in Kentucky is reasoned and delivered and ensures we can maintain the reliability and resiliency of our customers and public officials demand. We actually need to figure out a way to do the same in deregulated markets like PJM and ISO New England. And it's why becoming more efficient is such a critical component of our strategy because for every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can spend $8 on capital without impacting the customer bill. The energy transition simply won't happen if customers cannot afford it. This is how we will achieve our long-term vision and how we intend to enhance the value we deliver for all stakeholders. It requires us to lead from the front and that is exactly what we've been doing and what we will continue to do in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 8 and our priorities for 2024. In addition to advancing our Utilities of the Future Strategy, our 2024 priorities also include achieving at least the midpoint of our earnings per share forecast, executing $3.1 billion in infrastructure investments to maintain safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers and modernize the grid. Delivering on our 2024 O&M savings targets as we deploy scalable technologies across our portfolio, take advantage of economies of scale created by our centralization efforts, and continue to leverage data analytics to reduce costs and optimize asset planning and maintenance. Finally, we need to complete our integration of Rhode Island Energy and exit all remaining tranches and service agreements with National Grid. Bottom-line, we're eager to showcase PPL's strengths once again in 2024, and we are poised to lead on these very significant issues facing our industry. We have tremendous conviction in our strategy and business plan and in our ability to execute them both and we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to customers and shareowners. That concludes my business and strategic update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. PPL's fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.26 per share in Q4 2022. We recorded special items of $0.25 per share during the fourth quarter, primarily due to a settlement agreement with Talen Energy Corporation as well as integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.40 per share, an improvement of $0.12 per share compared to Q4 2022. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the continued mild weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In total, weather was a $0.02 per share drag on our Q4 results compared to our plan. On an annual basis, our 2023 GAAP earnings were $1 per share. Adjusting for $0.60 per share of special items recorded throughout the year, our 2023 ongoing earnings were $1.60 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share of ongoing earnings for 2022 or a 13% increase from those prior year results. And as Vince noted, we delivered our earnings target for 2023, exceeding the $1.58 per share midpoint of our earnings forecast. Our teams did a fantastic job of executing our plan, while remaining steadfast in achieving our financial goals, which enabled us to offset the adverse impacts of significant unfavorable weather and storm activity, while maintaining reliability for our customers. 2023 demonstrated our ability to deal with adversity and still achieve our commitments to both customers and shareowners, adding to our confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings targets. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.04 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in Kentucky's results were primarily driven by lower O&M expense, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share. This increase was primarily driven by higher rider revenue from capital investments, partially offset by higher interest expense. Finally, results at corporate and other were flat compared to the prior period, primarily due to lower income taxes, offset by higher O&M expense. Moving to Slide 12, 2023 was a pivotal year for PPL following our strategic repositioning, which we completed in 2022. Heading into the year, we set our 2023 earnings forecast range with a midpoint of $1.58 per share, representing 7% growth from the 2022 pro forma midpoint of $1.48 per share, which reflected a full year of earnings from Rhode Island Energy. And for the second consecutive year, we outperformed our own targets, beating our earnings forecast by $0.02 and achieving over 8% growth for the 2022 pro forma forecast midpoint. This was a significant achievement given the abnormally mild weather and storms we experienced, which impacted results by more than $0.10 per share. As I said numerous times over the past year, we were confident that our team would overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to both our customers and shareowners. This included several areas of excellent execution and constructive regulatory mechanisms, including prudent management of costs without sacrificing reliability, recovery of critical infrastructure investments in PA through the DSIC mechanism, outperformance and integration of Rhode Island Energy, and optimization of our financing plan. Looking at 2024, the midpoint of our earnings forecast range is $1.69 per share, which again represents 7% earnings growth from the midpoint of our 2023 forecast. Since we initially communicated our earnings growth targets to investors, we remain on that consistent trajectory, while extending that growth further into the future. And we've done that again today with our extension of the 6% to 8% growth targets to 2027, supported by an updated capital investment plan, which I'll discuss in more detail in a couple of slides. Moving to Slide 13. On this slide, we've provided a walk from our 2023 actual results of $1.60 per share to the midpoint of our 2024 forecast, highlighting the projected drivers of the year-over-year increase by segment. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher sales volume and lower O&M, partially offset by less distribution rider recovery and higher interest expense. We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.07 per share in 2024, primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to the expected return to normal weather. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.02 per share in 2024 compared to our 2023 results. This is primarily due to higher capital investment rider revenue and lower O&M, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Finally, we project our corporate and other results to decrease by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to higher interest expense and other factors that are not individually significant. Turning to Slide 14. Over the next four years, we have planned capital investments of $14.3 billion, focused on delivering superior service and enhancing the overall customer experience, while maintaining an affordable price. This includes advancing industry-leading grid modernization, expanding and hardening our transmission networks, improving the safety of our natural gas networks, and implementing our approved generation replacement plan in Kentucky. This plan represents a $2.4 billion increase in capital investments compared to the prior four-year plan. Approximately $1 billion of that increase is expected to occur in the 2024 to 2026 period. Most of that increase is projected to be in Pennsylvania and Kentucky as we continue to modernize our electric transmission and distribution systems and enhanced reliability and resiliency. We continue to expect significant investment needs until the end of this decade as reflected on our 2027 forecast. This includes nearly $1.2 billion in Pennsylvania, of which approximately 65% is transmission investment under FERC formula rates; $1.8 billion of investment in Kentucky, primarily related to further enhancements on the electric and gas T&D systems and to execute our generation replacement plan; and it includes over $700 million of investment in Rhode Island as we continue to prepare the grid for significant levels of clean energy resources and enhance resiliency against increasingly severe storms, while continuing our focus to maintain a safe and reliable gas network by replacing leak-prone pipe. Turning to Slide 15. These additional capital investments are projected to lead to annual rate base growth of 6.3% from 2023 to 2027. This compares to annual rate base growth of 5.6% in our prior plan period from 2022 to 2026. As you can see on the chart, two-thirds of our rate base relates to investments in our electric T&D networks, given the significant needs as we strengthen and modernize the grid. Importantly, while we project our total rate base to grow, rate base related to coal generation continues to decline from 2023 to 2027. In fact, the percentage of our total rate base related to coal generation is expected to be less than 12% by the end of 2027, down from about 18% today. And based on this trajectory, we expect this to continue to decline and be under 10% by the end of the decade. In summary, the result of our updated plan narrows the gap between our projected rate base growth and earnings growth targets as investment needs continue to increase with the evolving energy landscape. As such, we continue to be very focused on affordability and maximizing every dollar we spend. Our earnings growth in the near-term continues to be driven by the combination of rate base growth and operating efficiencies that we believe maximizes value for both customers and shareowners. Moving to Slide 16. Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.2575 per share. This results in an annualized dividend of $1.03 per share compared to our prior annualized dividend of $0.96 per share. The 7.3% increase aligns with our projected 2024 forecasted earnings growth and long-term EPS growth targets. We continue to expect future dividend growth to align with our earnings growth targets. The updated dividend remains within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65% based on the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast. The combination of PPL's EPS growth and dividend yields provides investors with an attractive total return proposition in the range of 9% to 12%. Moving to an update on PPL's credit and our financing plan for 2024 on Slide 17. We continue to believe that having one of the sector's strongest balance sheets is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility. Our updated business plan maintains strong credit metrics throughout. This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%. We have limited near-term refinancing risk with zero maturities in 2024 and only $550 million of total maturities in 2025. And we continue to maintain limited floating rate debt exposure, mitigating volatility in our plan. We also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our updated planning period, which is now extended through 2027. As investors think about our financing plan for 2024, they should expect our activity to be primarily focused on funding our utility capital plans with operating company debt. We've already executed a portion of this plan with our $650 million PPL Electric Utilities deal in January, which was executed at attractive pricing. We're also planning to be in the market for Rhode Island with our first debt offering since the acquisition. We have no current plans for debt issuances in Kentucky or a PPO capital funding this year, but that is an area we'll continue to evaluate opportunistically in connection with market conditions and our strong financial position. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position and outlook to execute our updated plan. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned earlier, this is a pivotal time for our industry, a time that requires us to lead with strength. There is no shortage of challenges facing our industry and being able to deliver the clean energy transition safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers. This is what gets me out of bed every morning and why I'm so excited to be a part of this industry at this moment in time. I'm convinced we have the right strategy for the right time, a strategy that prioritizes efficiency and affordability built on our core strength and will maximize long-term value for customers and shareowners alike. We are well-positioned to continue our competitive and predictable long-term earnings growth of 6% to 8% a year. We've established a derisked and disciplined business plan that advances a safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future while providing investors with an attractive return proposition. And finally, we have an experienced leadership team that is 100% committed to delivering on these objectives and backed by a dedicated team of 6,500 strong across PPL. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys.\nVince Sorgi: Morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning Vince. So, just on the transmission side, I see you've added a couple of hundred million to the Pennsylvania plan. How much of that is tied to the recent RTEP Window 3 awards? The reason why I'm asking is we've seen some significant increases in transmission needs and transfer capability across utilities in Eastern PJM and EMAC. So, just trying to get a sense for what has started to trickle into your plan versus incremental? Thanks.\nJoe Bergstein: Hey Shar, it's Joe. About half of that increase is driven by what you're describing and what we were awarded in that recent PJM window.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then just coming back to the Kentucky spend, the CPCN process, obviously, had deferred, but not quite closed the door to the second CCGT. Is that something like you could revisit and could the spend start to land in the outer years of the latest plan? Just kind of trying to get a sense for the next incremental focus. Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. To your point, Shar, the order suggested that we should come back with another CPCN filing with an in-service date for that second CCGT in 2030. And so we would plan on doing that in a couple of years' time to start to prepare for that and obviously, we'll be updating that as we go through the IRP process this year looking at load and generation economics and all that. So, the first point is really the updated IRP that we'll file this year and then ultimately, that will feed into a CPCN filing to be -- to have a plant in service in 2030.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. That\u2019s all the questions I had. Congrats on the execution, it's pretty notable. Appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Shar. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Morning Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning Vince. Good morning. I just had a question on Pennsylvania. Maybe just can you elaborate on what you plan to do or any color you can share on the district itself? The reason why I ask is the -- your peer water utility in the state, their rate case is drawing a lot of attention, there are new commissioners at the commission. So, just maybe just talk to the regulatory environment in the state. And then what -- if you could share any color on what you might try to do with amending the DSIC mechanism, that would be great? Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So, maybe a precursor to the DSIC waiver is really the LTIP process that we have in the state, Durgesh. In mid-January, we filed a petition with the commission to modify our LTIP, which covers the period. That's the long-term infrastructure improvement plan that covers the period from January 1, 2023 to 12/31/27. So, we're already a year into this current LTIP plan. We did file for some significant adjustments to that plan, which the LTIP is really the precursor for the types of projects that would then be eligible to flow through the DSIC mechanism. We're proposing to increase that LTIP plan from about $500 million to about $800 million. We're including a new project or a new program for predictive failure technology. We've been doing a lot of testing on some new devices that we can put on the grid that actually enable us to identify failing equipment before it actually fails and causes an outage. So, we have some money in there that we want to include. We're also looking at just other distribution reliability projects. Our reliability very strong in Pennsylvania being led by our transmission results there. We need to continue to improve our distribution reliability, so additional money in there for that. And then, of course, we have the approved projects through the IIJA process that we also updated the LTIP 4. So, the parties have 30 days to file comments on our LTIP filing. And those comments are actually due today. So, we'll want to review those comments before we file for the DSIC waiver request. We have notified the PUC of our intention to file that waiver request. And we'd expect to file that relatively soon, Durgesh. At this point, the request what we're still working on, it will likely be in the form of the higher cap on the DSIC.\nDurgesh Chopra: Perfect. I appreciate that color and congrats on the quarter guys. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Morning Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: Good morning. So, I -- it's a bit of an unfair question, I admit. So, we're waiting to see this potential large data center to be developed next to or -- directly next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant, which is obviously, your service territory and your former asset. So, I'm just wondering, so if that were to happen, if we were to have this almost 1,000 megawatts data center, what type of investments would that require from you guys from like a T&D perspective? And is it already embedded in your plan?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, let me talk about maybe data centers more broadly. You're referring to one that's specifically related or will be tied to the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So, most of that activity is really between Talen and the data center entity, although we are working with Talen to ensure that the reliability of power supply is there for that center. So, some incremental work there, Angie. What I would say, though, more broadly, beyond that specific instances, we've really started to see some data center activity, both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with some very large load requirements, again, 1-gig size projects, some smaller than that, but we are seeing some 1-gig projects as well. And in our territories, we have some -- a number of positive attributes that these data centers are looking for. Not only is our reliability very strong in the top quartile, top decile range, especially in our transmission side of the business, which is where these generally are pulling their power from our reliability there is extremely high. We also have relatively inexpensive land and an abundance of that land in both of our jurisdictions in PA and Kentucky. And then in Pennsylvania, in particular, we have a decent amount of capacity on the transmission network that we could add this load without a lot of investment that still is incredibly beneficial for our customers because that will still lower the overall cost and bill for our retail customers, the more and more load that we can connect to the transmission network. And then, of course, we're close to New England and the Mid-Atlantic region, especially as you think about Pennsylvania. So, there's a number of things in our territories that make this attractive. And of course, in Kentucky, we have relatively cheap power prices. So, very active in working with the data center companies. We haven't included these in our load forecast at this point. We will do that at the appropriate time if and when we close these deals with these folks. But I would just say at this point, a lot of activity going on with the data centers as you're hearing with some of our peers as well.\nAngie Storozynski: And can I ask about Kentucky. So, you mentioned that the grid is getting tighter from the power supply perspective. I mean, one, does it make you sort of reassess your plans about retirements of coal plants and/or additions of new gas plants in the state? And also, how do those data center providers actually look at thermal power from gas and coal versus, I don't know, nuclear or renewables? Does that matter? Do they really care about the carbon footprint or emissions? Or is it mostly the total cost and how cheap the power is?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, for the most part, what we're seeing, Angie, is reliability and reliability of power. I think you're right, there are some data center companies that also want to ensure that, that power is coming from green energy sources like what we're seeing up in Susquehanna, as you mentioned earlier. But for the most part, it's about reliability and the cost of that power because, obviously, these are huge costs for these data centers is the cost of the electricity itself. So, to your point, we don't have as much capacity in Kentucky as we do up here in Pennsylvania. And so we would expect there to be incremental investment needed to support data centers in Kentucky perhaps more so than we would need at least in the near-term in Pennsylvania. Certainly, this will feed into, as I was mentioning before, into our IRP process as we look at our load growth as we think about our generation replacement strategy, a little too early I would say, to say we need to modify our current thinking on that. But clearly, if some of these large centers hit, we're going to have to factor that into the IRP and then ultimately into that CPCN request a couple of years from now.\nAngie Storozynski: Awesome. Thank you. Congrats.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi good morning team.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning. Hey Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo: First one on the O&M target and please correct me if I'm wrong. It looks like you reaffirmed them all, but exceeded the 2023 target by around like $20 million. Just what would -- I know the targets are at least, what would you need to see to kind of increase those targets? And what kind of drove that initial outperformance versus target?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, sure. Hey Paul, it's Joe. So, first focusing on what drove the outperformance in 2023. As we noted, we achieved $75 million in savings compared to the $50 million to $60 million target that we had coming into the year. It was really driven by acceleration of some of the initiatives from 2024. When we started the TMO process, we have initiative owners for all these projects that will deliver these savings and we've set milestones and KPIs for all of them. And so what we saw bringing that rigor to the process has actually allowed us to accelerate in some areas, which gives us confidence in achieving the $120 million to $130 million next year and the $175 million overall. As we talked about -- as Vince talked about in his remarks, focused on the Utility of the Future and ensuring affordability for customers is key. And so from that perspective, we'll continue to look to get more efficient as we go through the plan. But where we are today is we're still holding that $175 million -- at least $175 million as we said. What I can say is the growth that we're talking about here and extending that into 2027 doesn't rely on further efficiencies. So, to the extent that we're successful in identifying more of that would be upside to the current plan.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, great. Very clear. And then on the rate case timing strategy, I know Vince listed a bunch of factors. But one of them wasn't about how rate cases go for peers. Just curious how important is that as you think through the process, how the -- especially in Pennsylvania, just given a lot of the rate cases as Durgesh was mentioning, how important is that to kind of assess your own plan?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Well, clearly, because we have no rate cases in 2024 across the board, we're able to assess the regulatory environment and the outcomes that our peers are getting. As we know, not every company gets the same outcome even under the same jurisdiction, so it wouldn't totally impact our decision. But clearly, it's something we will keep an eye on and feed into our decision-making. And again, the fact that we don't have anything for the -- certainly the rest of this year and likely the first one will be down in Kentucky sometime in 2025. I feel pretty good about our timing that we have in the plan right now.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, great. Thanks and nicely done last year.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey good morning guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Just a couple of quick ones. One up to follow-up from Angie's question. What's this load growth forecast you're assuming for 2024?\nJoe Bergstein: Hey Anthony, it's Joe. We're assuming 50 basis points load growth throughout our planning horizon.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then if I could jump on Durgesh's question, in Pennsylvania, you're filing the DSIC, and I think you're looking to raise the cap you talked about it. Just curious -- again, I'm not saying that it's -- I'm here to say it doesn't get approved. But if you don't get approval, does that increase the frequency of the rate filing, or you believe you have other offsets that you could still stay out in Pennsylvania a little longer?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, it's the latter, Anthony. We have some modest value in the plan coming from the DSIC filing. I think the real benefit is it would enable us to stay out longer in Pennsylvania and make the investments that we had talked about. But yes, to your point, if for some reason that, that request does not get approved, we're comfortable we can manage that and still maintain the growth targets that we've talked about.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just lastly on Slide 17. I appreciate the detail on the -- you don't have any near-term financing. Just in 2026, you see the capital funding, you also have the Electric Utility funding there. On those maturities, do you think you'll retire those vehicles -- those financing vehicles? Do you think you just roll over that? I'm just curious on what your plan is on those financing vehicles?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, Anthony, we'll have to assess that as we get closer. Obviously, where interest rates are will play a big role in what we do there. So, I think it's a little early to tell on how we'll treat those. Our assumption is that we refi them.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks so much Vince. Talk to you guys soon.\nVince Sorgi: Take care Anthony. Go Rangers.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Paz with Wolfe. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hey David. Good morning.\nDavid Paz: Good morning. Can you hear me?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes.\nDavid Paz: Okay, great. Thank you. Just actually following up on the previous question. FFO-to-debt, in particular, where are you in that 16% to 18% currently? And where kind of -- how does that -- what's the profile of that over the course of your plan?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, I would just say we're comfortably in that 16% to 18% range. We -- in the early part of the plan, we continue to have integration cost for Rhode Island that obviously are -- impact the credit metric and those roll away. And then you see the CapEx increase later in the plan. So, we feel really good about where we are within that range and kind of operate comfortably around the midpoint.\nDavid Paz: Perfect. Thank you. And then just -- I don't know if you touched on this, but what are your opportunities -- or what opportunities do you see from the pending offshore wind solicitations? More transmission? What do you have in your plan, if anything? Just any color you can provide, that would be great.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So, a couple of opportunities there. Obviously, we have the RFP that we've issued in Rhode Island. We are not the owners of that, but we would be the offtaker of that generation. And so to your point, we have -- we do have in the plan the transmission required to the enhancements to transmission grid to handle that offshore wind load. We have talked in the past about our joint venture with wind grid to potentially provide wet transmission solutions more broadly up in Rhode Island or New England that we would partner with them on where we would not own the turbine -- the wind turbine generation, but we would build out a mesh network of sorts to lower the overall cost of the transmission build-out as we think about upwards of 30 gigs of offshore wind over the next, say, decade being built out there. That opportunity will highly depend on where the US Treasury ultimately comes out on their implementation provisions for the IRA. So, we are monitoring those regulations very closely. The initial regs that came out from the treasury, we think were in error in proposing that the regulations would limit the eligibility of the ITC credit for that wet transmission only if that transmission is owned by the same taxpayer that owns the wind turbines themselves. That limitation, if the final rules come out that way, would unnecessarily raise the cost of the offshore wind industry, which we know is quite challenged. And so we continue to engage with the administration and other policymakers to try to improve that final regulation and expand it to all taxpayers, not just ones that own the turbines and to try to bring the overall cost of offshore wind down so that we can get this very important clean energy source kind of up and running in the US. But I can't give you any assurance in terms of what that final rule is going to say. I can say we don't have any of that upside potential in our business plan. It's not in our growth projections at all at this point. I would say, kind of hinges on this. And then the states really coming together up there and partnering on this broader solution, which we believe will certainly bring the cost of offshore wind down.\nDavid Paz: Great. Thank you so much for all the color.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Just want to say thanks for joining us. Again, strong end to 2023, really looking forward to 2024 and beyond. I've spent quite a bit of time talking about the Utility of the Future strategy.

            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and year end investor update. I'm excited for today's call as we closed out 2023 in strong fashion and our future continues to look very bright. And I look forward to highlighting why that is on today's call. Turning to Slide 4. I'm very proud of what our PPL team was able to accomplish in 2023. In short, it was a year of challenges met and promises kept. Most importantly, we delivered electricity and natural gas safely and reliably to our more than 3.5 million customers. This included top quartile T&D reliability at each of our utilities, including record reliability for our companies in Kentucky and Rhode Island and top decile performance in Pennsylvania. Our generation reliability in Kentucky was among the very best in the nation. We achieved all this despite heightened storm activity in each of our service territories. At the same time and despite over $0.10 per share impact from mild weather and storms, we delivered on every one of our financial commitments to our shareowners. Namely, we achieved ongoing earnings of $1.60 per share, exceeding the midpoint of our ongoing earnings forecast by $0.02 and delivering over 8% growth from pro forma 2022. We achieved this through our strong focus on operational efficiency and outperformance in key areas that Joe will cover in his financial review. We also executed $2.4 billion in planned capital spend on time and on budget to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable, and cleaner energy future. We exceeded our annual O&M savings target for 2023 through our strong enterprise-wide focus on technology and business transformation, achieving $75 million in savings from our 2021 baseline, reinforcing our continuous improvement mindset and putting us solidly on track to deliver our targeted $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. These operational and financial achievements were matched by strong results elsewhere in the business that position us for future success. Underpinned by sound planning and effective management of regulatory proceedings, we secured constructive regulatory outcomes in Kentucky and Rhode Island. In Kentucky, we secured approval for about $2 billion in generation replacement investments as part of our CPCN process that concluded in November of last year. The KPSC's decision ensures that we can continue to meet our customers' future energy needs safely, reliably, and affordably, while advancing a cleaner energy mix in the state. And in Rhode Island, we secured approval of our first infrastructure, safety, and reliability plans since acquiring Rhode Island Energy. In addition, we received the green light to deploy advanced metering functionality across Rhode Island, as we lay a foundation for a smarter, more resilient, more reliable, and more dynamic electric grid capable of supporting the state's leading climate goals. Finally, we continue to provide a smooth and seamless transition to PPL ownership for our Rhode Island Energy stakeholders, completing all planned 2023 integration milestones and keeping us on track to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in mid-2024. These achievements are a direct result of our focus on execution, our disciplined investment strategy, our ability to adjust when challenges arise, our experienced leadership team, and clarity of purpose across PPL as we pursue our Utilities of the Future Strategy. Looking ahead, we recognize we still have room to improve as we pursue our vision to be the best utility company in the US. And in 2024, we're determined to make continued progress as we seek to maximize long-term value for both our customers and shareowners. Turning to Slide 5. Today, we announced the results of our updated business plan, which extends our projected growth outlook through at least 2027. In connection with this update, today, we announced our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. The midpoint of this range, $1.69 per share, represents 7% growth from our 2023 ongoing earnings per share target, consistent with our long-term growth targets. In addition, today, we announced a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.2575 per share. This represents a 7.3% increase from the current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share and aligns with our commitment to dividend growth in line with our EPS growth targets. We've extended our 6% to 8% annual EPS and dividend growth targets through at least 2027 based off the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast range. In addition to today's updated growth forecast, our updated capital plan includes $14.3 billion from 2024 to 2027 to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability. The new plan is expected to drive average annual rate base growth of 6.3% through 2027, up from the prior growth rate of 5.6%. We plan to fund these additional investments supported by our exceptional balance sheet as our credit metrics remain well within our targets throughout the planned period without the need for equity issuances through at least 2027. As I highlighted in my recap of 2023, we've made outstanding progress towards our multiyear target of at least $175 million in annual O&M savings by 2026. Based on the progress we made last year, we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2024 targeted savings of $120 million to $130 million. In terms of rate case timing in the plan, we do not anticipate any base rate case filings in 2024 in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, or Rhode Island. Looking beyond 2024, our current projections would have us filing a base rate case a bit sooner in Kentucky than previously anticipated due to several factors, including the CPCN decision and additional capital investment needs on the T&D side of the business. Currently, we believe the earliest we would file a rate case in Kentucky will be in the first half of 2025. For Rhode Island, the earliest we would file is late 2025, which is consistent with the prior plan. Finally, in Pennsylvania, recall that we have not been in for a base rate case since 2015 and we have no plans to go in again before 2026 at the earliest. The DSIC mechanism in Pennsylvania has operated as designed to support long-term infrastructure investment between rate cases. We do see an increased need to invest more to improve reliability on the distribution system and filed with the Pennsylvania PUC a request to modify our long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP, which includes an increase in planned DSIC eligible investment over a five-year period. We are considering filing a waiver request with the Pennsylvania PUC in the near future, requesting modifications to the DSIC mechanism to support accelerated replacement of aging infrastructure. As always, our focus is on maintaining affordability for our customers. And we will continue to evaluate the need for future rate cases based on a variety of factors, including capital plans, interest rates, market conditions, and regulatory lag. Turning to Slide 6. Our updated plan and business outlook supports our Utilities of the Future Strategy, which is core to everything we do. What does that mean to us? It means updating our design criteria and continuing to harden our transmission and distribution systems to protect against climate change and keep our systems and data secure again cyber threats. It means expanding our industry-leading use of technology, including smart grids, automation, data analytics, AI, and technologies that haven't even been invented yet to build a self-healing grid. It means investing in R&D to drive innovation to advance technologies that can be scaled safely, reliably, and affordably to meet our customers' evolving energy needs and to actually achieve net zero. Like the carbon capture project that was awarded a $72 million DOE grant at our Cane Run combined cycle plant in Kentucky. At the same time, it means expanding transmission and incorporating grid-enhancing technologies to connect more renewables and improve reliability for our customers; advancing a cleaner generation mix, while keeping energy safe, reliable and affordable; expanding our ability to reliably manage two-way power flows on the distribution network as we connect significant more distributed energy; driving operational efficiencies to support an affordable clean energy transition; partnering with our customers and state and local officials to enable growth and economic development in our communities; and lastly, expanding self-service options for our customers using digital tools to enhance the customer experience. Turning to Slide 7. As you can hear, creating the Utilities of the Future requires change across our entire business, and it requires significant investments to support a net zero economy. The industry and others are projecting a 200% to 300% increase in electricity demand, which will require additions of reliable generation unless we see unprecedented amounts of energy conservation. At the same time, aging fossil fuel plants in this country are being retired very rapidly without replacements of reliable, dispatchable generation capacity. And considering that fossil fuel generation represents more than 50% of our total capacity in the US, that presents a potentially major problem if this transition is not managed appropriately. The math simply doesn't add up when we don't have proven, scalable technology currently available to actually achieve net zero carbon emissions that customers can afford. Most technologies used in our industry took 40 years to commercialize from the demonstration phase. We need to cut that timeframe in half, at least to meet net zero by 2050 targets, especially as we think about the big four new potential technologies, nuclear SMRs, carbon capture and sequestration, long-duration energy storage, and hydrogen. In the meantime, we need to leverage commercially viable resources that exist today to reduce our carbon footprint, while maintaining reliability. Those that are dispatchable, can ramp up and down quickly and are vital to balancing the gaps left on the system by intermittent renewables. That is why natural gas generation is the key to achieving deep decarbonization in this country and it actually allows us to deploy more renewables than we would otherwise be able to do because of the reliability benefits of natural gas. In a nutshell, this is what makes the energy transition such a challenge being able to deliver the clean energy future in a way that maintains reliability and affordability for our customers. However, with every challenge brings opportunity. And that's why we know our Utilities of the Future strategy is the right approach for this dynamic energy landscape. It's why our generation transition plan in Kentucky is reasoned and delivered and ensures we can maintain the reliability and resiliency of our customers and public officials demand. We actually need to figure out a way to do the same in deregulated markets like PJM and ISO New England. And it's why becoming more efficient is such a critical component of our strategy because for every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can spend $8 on capital without impacting the customer bill. The energy transition simply won't happen if customers cannot afford it. This is how we will achieve our long-term vision and how we intend to enhance the value we deliver for all stakeholders. It requires us to lead from the front and that is exactly what we've been doing and what we will continue to do in 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 8 and our priorities for 2024. In addition to advancing our Utilities of the Future Strategy, our 2024 priorities also include achieving at least the midpoint of our earnings per share forecast, executing $3.1 billion in infrastructure investments to maintain safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers and modernize the grid. Delivering on our 2024 O&M savings targets as we deploy scalable technologies across our portfolio, take advantage of economies of scale created by our centralization efforts, and continue to leverage data analytics to reduce costs and optimize asset planning and maintenance. Finally, we need to complete our integration of Rhode Island Energy and exit all remaining tranches and service agreements with National Grid. Bottom-line, we're eager to showcase PPL's strengths once again in 2024, and we are poised to lead on these very significant issues facing our industry. We have tremendous conviction in our strategy and business plan and in our ability to execute them both and we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to customers and shareowners. That concludes my business and strategic update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. As I mentioned earlier, this is a pivotal time for our industry, a time that requires us to lead with strength. There is no shortage of challenges facing our industry and being able to deliver the clean energy transition safely, reliably, and affordably for our customers. This is what gets me out of bed every morning and why I'm so excited to be a part of this industry at this moment in time. I'm convinced we have the right strategy for the right time, a strategy that prioritizes efficiency and affordability built on our core strength and will maximize long-term value for customers and shareowners alike. We are well-positioned to continue our competitive and predictable long-term earnings growth of 6% to 8% a year. We've established a derisked and disciplined business plan that advances a safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy future while providing investors with an attractive return proposition. And finally, we have an experienced leadership team that is 100% committed to delivering on these objectives and backed by a dedicated team of 6,500 strong across PPL. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Morning Shar. Yes. To your point, Shar, the order suggested that we should come back with another CPCN filing with an in-service date for that second CCGT in 2030. And so we would plan on doing that in a couple of years' time to start to prepare for that and obviously, we'll be updating that as we go through the IRP process this year looking at load and generation economics and all that. So, the first point is really the updated IRP that we'll file this year and then ultimately, that will feed into a CPCN filing to be -- to have a plant in service in 2030. Thanks Shar. Appreciate it. Morning Durgesh. Sure. So, maybe a precursor to the DSIC waiver is really the LTIP process that we have in the state, Durgesh. In mid-January, we filed a petition with the commission to modify our LTIP, which covers the period. That's the long-term infrastructure improvement plan that covers the period from January 1, 2023 to 12/31/27. So, we're already a year into this current LTIP plan. We did file for some significant adjustments to that plan, which the LTIP is really the precursor for the types of projects that would then be eligible to flow through the DSIC mechanism. We're proposing to increase that LTIP plan from about $500 million to about $800 million. We're including a new project or a new program for predictive failure technology. We've been doing a lot of testing on some new devices that we can put on the grid that actually enable us to identify failing equipment before it actually fails and causes an outage. So, we have some money in there that we want to include. We're also looking at just other distribution reliability projects. Our reliability very strong in Pennsylvania being led by our transmission results there. We need to continue to improve our distribution reliability, so additional money in there for that. And then, of course, we have the approved projects through the IIJA process that we also updated the LTIP 4. So, the parties have 30 days to file comments on our LTIP filing. And those comments are actually due today. So, we'll want to review those comments before we file for the DSIC waiver request. We have notified the PUC of our intention to file that waiver request. And we'd expect to file that relatively soon, Durgesh. At this point, the request what we're still working on, it will likely be in the form of the higher cap on the DSIC. Great. Thanks Durgesh. Yes. So, let me talk about maybe data centers more broadly. You're referring to one that's specifically related or will be tied to the Susquehanna nuclear plant. So, most of that activity is really between Talen and the data center entity, although we are working with Talen to ensure that the reliability of power supply is there for that center. So, some incremental work there, Angie. What I would say, though, more broadly, beyond that specific instances, we've really started to see some data center activity, both in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, with some very large load requirements, again, 1-gig size projects, some smaller than that, but we are seeing some 1-gig projects as well. And in our territories, we have some -- a number of positive attributes that these data centers are looking for. Not only is our reliability very strong in the top quartile, top decile range, especially in our transmission side of the business, which is where these generally are pulling their power from our reliability there is extremely high. We also have relatively inexpensive land and an abundance of that land in both of our jurisdictions in PA and Kentucky. And then in Pennsylvania, in particular, we have a decent amount of capacity on the transmission network that we could add this load without a lot of investment that still is incredibly beneficial for our customers because that will still lower the overall cost and bill for our retail customers, the more and more load that we can connect to the transmission network. And then, of course, we're close to New England and the Mid-Atlantic region, especially as you think about Pennsylvania. So, there's a number of things in our territories that make this attractive. And of course, in Kentucky, we have relatively cheap power prices. So, very active in working with the data center companies. We haven't included these in our load forecast at this point. We will do that at the appropriate time if and when we close these deals with these folks. But I would just say at this point, a lot of activity going on with the data centers as you're hearing with some of our peers as well. Yes, for the most part, what we're seeing, Angie, is reliability and reliability of power. I think you're right, there are some data center companies that also want to ensure that, that power is coming from green energy sources like what we're seeing up in Susquehanna, as you mentioned earlier. But for the most part, it's about reliability and the cost of that power because, obviously, these are huge costs for these data centers is the cost of the electricity itself. So, to your point, we don't have as much capacity in Kentucky as we do up here in Pennsylvania. And so we would expect there to be incremental investment needed to support data centers in Kentucky perhaps more so than we would need at least in the near-term in Pennsylvania. Certainly, this will feed into, as I was mentioning before, into our IRP process as we look at our load growth as we think about our generation replacement strategy, a little too early I would say, to say we need to modify our current thinking on that. But clearly, if some of these large centers hit, we're going to have to factor that into the IRP and then ultimately into that CPCN request a couple of years from now. Thank you. Good morning. Hey Paul. Yes. Well, clearly, because we have no rate cases in 2024 across the board, we're able to assess the regulatory environment and the outcomes that our peers are getting. As we know, not every company gets the same outcome even under the same jurisdiction, so it wouldn't totally impact our decision. But clearly, it's something we will keep an eye on and feed into our decision-making. And again, the fact that we don't have anything for the -- certainly the rest of this year and likely the first one will be down in Kentucky sometime in 2025. I feel pretty good about our timing that we have in the plan right now. Great. Thanks. Yes, it's the latter, Anthony. We have some modest value in the plan coming from the DSIC filing. I think the real benefit is it would enable us to stay out longer in Pennsylvania and make the investments that we had talked about. But yes, to your point, if for some reason that, that request does not get approved, we're comfortable we can manage that and still maintain the growth targets that we've talked about. Take care Anthony. Go Rangers. Hey David. Good morning. Sure. So, a couple of opportunities there. Obviously, we have the RFP that we've issued in Rhode Island. We are not the owners of that, but we would be the offtaker of that generation. And so to your point, we have -- we do have in the plan the transmission required to the enhancements to transmission grid to handle that offshore wind load. We have talked in the past about our joint venture with wind grid to potentially provide wet transmission solutions more broadly up in Rhode Island or New England that we would partner with them on where we would not own the turbine -- the wind turbine generation, but we would build out a mesh network of sorts to lower the overall cost of the transmission build-out as we think about upwards of 30 gigs of offshore wind over the next, say, decade being built out there. That opportunity will highly depend on where the US Treasury ultimately comes out on their implementation provisions for the IRA. So, we are monitoring those regulations very closely. The initial regs that came out from the treasury, we think were in error in proposing that the regulations would limit the eligibility of the ITC credit for that wet transmission only if that transmission is owned by the same taxpayer that owns the wind turbines themselves. That limitation, if the final rules come out that way, would unnecessarily raise the cost of the offshore wind industry, which we know is quite challenged. And so we continue to engage with the administration and other policymakers to try to improve that final regulation and expand it to all taxpayers, not just ones that own the turbines and to try to bring the overall cost of offshore wind down so that we can get this very important clean energy source kind of up and running in the US. But I can't give you any assurance in terms of what that final rule is going to say. I can say we don't have any of that upside potential in our business plan. It's not in our growth projections at all at this point. I would say, kind of hinges on this. And then the states really coming together up there and partnering on this broader solution, which we believe will certainly bring the cost of offshore wind down. Sure. Just want to say thanks for joining us. Again, strong end to 2023, really looking forward to 2024 and beyond. I've spent quite a bit of time talking about the Utility of the Future strategy. We do think that's an area that differentiates us from our peers as well as the strength of our balance sheet and our overall dividend policy where we're growing the dividend in line with earnings. So, just appreciate everybody for calling us and -- for joining us and look forward to providing updates as we go through the year. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 10. PPL's fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.15 per share compared to $0.26 per share in Q4 2022. We recorded special items of $0.25 per share during the fourth quarter, primarily due to a settlement agreement with Talen Energy Corporation as well as integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, fourth quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.40 per share, an improvement of $0.12 per share compared to Q4 2022. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments and lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the continued mild weather experienced in the fourth quarter of 2023. In total, weather was a $0.02 per share drag on our Q4 results compared to our plan. On an annual basis, our 2023 GAAP earnings were $1 per share. Adjusting for $0.60 per share of special items recorded throughout the year, our 2023 ongoing earnings were $1.60 per share. This compares to $1.41 per share of ongoing earnings for 2022 or a 13% increase from those prior year results. And as Vince noted, we delivered our earnings target for 2023, exceeding the $1.58 per share midpoint of our earnings forecast. Our teams did a fantastic job of executing our plan, while remaining steadfast in achieving our financial goals, which enabled us to offset the adverse impacts of significant unfavorable weather and storm activity, while maintaining reliability for our customers. 2023 demonstrated our ability to deal with adversity and still achieve our commitments to both customers and shareowners, adding to our confidence in our ability to achieve our earnings targets. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the fourth quarter on Slide 11. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.04 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by lower O&M and higher transmission revenue, partially offset by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.06 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. The improvement in Kentucky's results were primarily driven by lower O&M expense, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share. This increase was primarily driven by higher rider revenue from capital investments, partially offset by higher interest expense. Finally, results at corporate and other were flat compared to the prior period, primarily due to lower income taxes, offset by higher O&M expense. Moving to Slide 12, 2023 was a pivotal year for PPL following our strategic repositioning, which we completed in 2022. Heading into the year, we set our 2023 earnings forecast range with a midpoint of $1.58 per share, representing 7% growth from the 2022 pro forma midpoint of $1.48 per share, which reflected a full year of earnings from Rhode Island Energy. And for the second consecutive year, we outperformed our own targets, beating our earnings forecast by $0.02 and achieving over 8% growth for the 2022 pro forma forecast midpoint. This was a significant achievement given the abnormally mild weather and storms we experienced, which impacted results by more than $0.10 per share. As I said numerous times over the past year, we were confident that our team would overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to both our customers and shareowners. This included several areas of excellent execution and constructive regulatory mechanisms, including prudent management of costs without sacrificing reliability, recovery of critical infrastructure investments in PA through the DSIC mechanism, outperformance and integration of Rhode Island Energy, and optimization of our financing plan. Looking at 2024, the midpoint of our earnings forecast range is $1.69 per share, which again represents 7% earnings growth from the midpoint of our 2023 forecast. Since we initially communicated our earnings growth targets to investors, we remain on that consistent trajectory, while extending that growth further into the future. And we've done that again today with our extension of the 6% to 8% growth targets to 2027, supported by an updated capital investment plan, which I'll discuss in more detail in a couple of slides. Moving to Slide 13. On this slide, we've provided a walk from our 2023 actual results of $1.60 per share to the midpoint of our 2024 forecast, highlighting the projected drivers of the year-over-year increase by segment. Our Pennsylvania segment results are expected to increase by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to returns on additional capital investments in transmission, higher sales volume and lower O&M, partially offset by less distribution rider recovery and higher interest expense. We project our Kentucky segment results to increase by $0.07 per share in 2024, primarily driven by higher sales volumes due to the expected return to normal weather. Our Rhode Island segment results are expected to increase by $0.02 per share in 2024 compared to our 2023 results. This is primarily due to higher capital investment rider revenue and lower O&M, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. Finally, we project our corporate and other results to decrease by $0.05 per share in 2024, primarily due to higher interest expense and other factors that are not individually significant. Turning to Slide 14. Over the next four years, we have planned capital investments of $14.3 billion, focused on delivering superior service and enhancing the overall customer experience, while maintaining an affordable price. This includes advancing industry-leading grid modernization, expanding and hardening our transmission networks, improving the safety of our natural gas networks, and implementing our approved generation replacement plan in Kentucky. This plan represents a $2.4 billion increase in capital investments compared to the prior four-year plan. Approximately $1 billion of that increase is expected to occur in the 2024 to 2026 period. Most of that increase is projected to be in Pennsylvania and Kentucky as we continue to modernize our electric transmission and distribution systems and enhanced reliability and resiliency. We continue to expect significant investment needs until the end of this decade as reflected on our 2027 forecast. This includes nearly $1.2 billion in Pennsylvania, of which approximately 65% is transmission investment under FERC formula rates; $1.8 billion of investment in Kentucky, primarily related to further enhancements on the electric and gas T&D systems and to execute our generation replacement plan; and it includes over $700 million of investment in Rhode Island as we continue to prepare the grid for significant levels of clean energy resources and enhance resiliency against increasingly severe storms, while continuing our focus to maintain a safe and reliable gas network by replacing leak-prone pipe. Turning to Slide 15. These additional capital investments are projected to lead to annual rate base growth of 6.3% from 2023 to 2027. This compares to annual rate base growth of 5.6% in our prior plan period from 2022 to 2026. As you can see on the chart, two-thirds of our rate base relates to investments in our electric T&D networks, given the significant needs as we strengthen and modernize the grid. Importantly, while we project our total rate base to grow, rate base related to coal generation continues to decline from 2023 to 2027. In fact, the percentage of our total rate base related to coal generation is expected to be less than 12% by the end of 2027, down from about 18% today. And based on this trajectory, we expect this to continue to decline and be under 10% by the end of the decade. In summary, the result of our updated plan narrows the gap between our projected rate base growth and earnings growth targets as investment needs continue to increase with the evolving energy landscape. As such, we continue to be very focused on affordability and maximizing every dollar we spend. Our earnings growth in the near-term continues to be driven by the combination of rate base growth and operating efficiencies that we believe maximizes value for both customers and shareowners. Moving to Slide 16. Today, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.2575 per share. This results in an annualized dividend of $1.03 per share compared to our prior annualized dividend of $0.96 per share. The 7.3% increase aligns with our projected 2024 forecasted earnings growth and long-term EPS growth targets. We continue to expect future dividend growth to align with our earnings growth targets. The updated dividend remains within our targeted dividend payout range of 60% to 65% based on the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast. The combination of PPL's EPS growth and dividend yields provides investors with an attractive total return proposition in the range of 9% to 12%. Moving to an update on PPL's credit and our financing plan for 2024 on Slide 17. We continue to believe that having one of the sector's strongest balance sheets is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility. Our updated business plan maintains strong credit metrics throughout. This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%. We have limited near-term refinancing risk with zero maturities in 2024 and only $550 million of total maturities in 2025. And we continue to maintain limited floating rate debt exposure, mitigating volatility in our plan. We also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our updated planning period, which is now extended through 2027. As investors think about our financing plan for 2024, they should expect our activity to be primarily focused on funding our utility capital plans with operating company debt. We've already executed a portion of this plan with our $650 million PPL Electric Utilities deal in January, which was executed at attractive pricing. We're also planning to be in the market for Rhode Island with our first debt offering since the acquisition. We have no current plans for debt issuances in Kentucky or a PPO capital funding this year, but that is an area we'll continue to evaluate opportunistically in connection with market conditions and our strong financial position. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our financial position and outlook to execute our updated plan. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince. Hey Shar, it's Joe. About half of that increase is driven by what you're describing and what we were awarded in that recent PJM window. Yes, sure. Hey Paul, it's Joe. So, first focusing on what drove the outperformance in 2023. As we noted, we achieved $75 million in savings compared to the $50 million to $60 million target that we had coming into the year. It was really driven by acceleration of some of the initiatives from 2024. When we started the TMO process, we have initiative owners for all these projects that will deliver these savings and we've set milestones and KPIs for all of them. And so what we saw bringing that rigor to the process has actually allowed us to accelerate in some areas, which gives us confidence in achieving the $120 million to $130 million next year and the $175 million overall. As we talked about -- as Vince talked about in his remarks, focused on the Utility of the Future and ensuring affordability for customers is key. And so from that perspective, we'll continue to look to get more efficient as we go through the plan. But where we are today is we're still holding that $175 million -- at least $175 million as we said. What I can say is the growth that we're talking about here and extending that into 2027 doesn't rely on further efficiencies. So, to the extent that we're successful in identifying more of that would be upside to the current plan. Thank you. Hey Anthony, it's Joe. We're assuming 50 basis points load growth throughout our planning horizon. Yes, Anthony, we'll have to assess that as we get closer. Obviously, where interest rates are will play a big role in what we do there. So, I think it's a little early to tell on how we'll treat those. Our assumption is that we refi them. Yes. Yes, I would just say we're comfortably in that 16% to 18% range. We -- in the early part of the plan, we continue to have integration cost for Rhode Island that obviously are -- impact the credit metric and those roll away. And then you see the CapEx increase later in the plan. So, we feel really good about where we are within that range and kind of operate comfortably around the midpoint."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on third quarter 2023 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. Begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer and conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks.\n Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.\n We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures including earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince. \nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Let's start with an overview of our financial results on Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.31 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.43 per share compared with $0.41 per share a year ago. These results position us well to deliver our 2023 earnings guidance, despite the significant impact of mild weather and storms in the first half of the year.\n As Joe will cover in his financial review, we've been successful in overcoming these headwinds through effective regulatory mechanisms, our continued focus on operating efficiently and outperformance in several other areas. The team has done an outstanding job in keeping us on track to deliver our 2023 financial objectives, while providing energy safely and reliably to our customers. As a result of our progress through Q3, we have narrowed our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast range to $1.55 to $1.60 per share, with the midpoint of $1.58 per share unchanged.\n As we look to close out the year in a strong fashion, we also remain on track to invest nearly $2.5 billion to modernize the grid, strengthen grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix. In addition, we're on pace to achieve our targeted $50 million to $60 million in O&M efficiencies this year. Looking forward, we've reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2026 as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This growth is supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and cleaner energy future.\n We expect to fund this growth without the need for equity issuances through at least 2026, while maintaining superior credit metrics and one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. Turning to Slide 5 and some operational highlights. We continue to deliver top quartile reliability and advanced industry-leading grid innovation that drives efficiency and improve service to our customers as we execute our utility in the future strategy. In support of this work, the Department of Energy has selected PPL Electric Utilities and Rhode Island Energy to receive a combined $100 million in federal funding for planned smart grid projects in our service territories.\n The projects that were selected by the DOE were generally included in our current capital plan. However, these grants will certainly help to support affordability for our customers, which we remain keenly focused on. Our Pennsylvania project will extend PPL Electric self-healing smart grid already one of the most sophisticated energy networks in the nation to further enhance great reliability and resiliency. Meanwhile, our Rhode Island project will accelerate Rhode Island Energy's investment in great resilience and smart grid capabilities to support the state's leading clean energy goals. The process to receive this funding through the IIJA was highly competitive. PPL was one of only a few companies to be selected for multiple awards in this initial round of funding.\n As we focus on creating the utilities of the future that are agile, innovative and technology enabled, we continue to be recognized for our leadership in the smart grid space. During the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities received 2 additional awards for innovative, industry-leading work that has helped improve the safety, reliability and affordability of electricity delivered to our more than 1.5 million customers in Pennsylvania. Moving to Rhode Island. We remain focused on supporting Rhode Island's clean energy goals and bringing more affordable offshore wind opportunities to the state. On October 13, we issued an RFP to procure 1,200 megawatts of offshore wind to help power the state's energy needs.\n The RFP was the state's largest ever renewable energy solicitation and was issued just a week after Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island signed a memorandum of understanding, paving the way for a potential multistate selection of offshore wind opportunities. Each state is conducting procurements in a similar time frame and we're hopeful that our larger procurement, a streamlined application process, flexibility on contract durations and the potential for multistate coordination will provide better economies of scale for developers, and reasonable pricing options for our customers. Bids are due by January 31, with any resulting selection expected next summer. \n Many PPAs agreed to by Rhode Island Energy would be subject to review and approval by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. Lastly, on this slide, LG&E began contract negotiations a few weeks ago for a labor contract that expires on November 10. The contract covers more than 600 of our employees in Kentucky. For decades, we have successfully worked together with our unions in Kentucky to reach agreement, and we're optimistic we can continue that success. We look forward to continued progress over the coming days and weeks to achieve an outcome that balances the needs of our employees and our customers. And importantly, the company has completed its preparedness plan to ensure we can continue to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers should negotiations break down.\n Moving to Slide 6 for a couple of key regulatory updates. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace up to 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We continue to believe that our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. The Kentucky Public Service Commission conducted public hearings in August, followed by post-year increase in September. The hearings as well as the intervenor briefs have largely been as expected. And looking forward, we continue to expect a decision from the commission by November 6.\n Shifting to Rhode Island. In late September, we received regulatory approval to deploy advanced metering functionality statewide as we lay the foundation for a smarter, more resilient, reliable and dynamic grid that supports the state's leading climate goals. As part of its unanimous decision, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission authorized capital investments of up to $153 million for this initiative. We're pleased with the outcome of the commission's decision for this important project. Advanced metering functionality, which we've deployed in Pennsylvania and are currently deploying in Kentucky is a key step in modernizing our energy networks.\n And as we've seen in our other service territories, it delivers significant benefits for our customers. We expect to begin installing the digital meters in late 2024 and to complete the deployment over the next 3 years, capitalizing on our experience in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. These investments will also be largely recoverable through the annual ISR process in Rhode Island. That concludes my operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. \nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. PPL's third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.31 per share compared to $0.24 per share in Q3 2022. We recorded special items of $0.12 per share during the third quarter, primarily due to the integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.43 per share, an improvement of $0.02 per share compared to Q3 2022. \n The primary drivers of the $0.02 per share increase were favorable transmission and disc rider revenues in Pennsylvania and lower O&M in Kentucky partially offset by higher interest expense due to increased borrowings. While weather was a significant factor in our earnings for the first half of the year, for the third quarter, weather did not materially impact our financial results versus our expectations. \n Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by higher transmission revenue and higher distribution rider recovery, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher O&M expense related to IT amortization costs. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by lower O&M expense, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our Rhode Island segment results decreased by $0.01 per share compared to 3Q 2022, primarily driven by higher O&M expense as we had fewer open positions this year than we did in the third quarter of 2022 when we were in the early stages of staffing up our teams.\n Finally, results in Corporate and Other decreased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 10. Our Q3 performance puts PPL's ongoing earnings at $1.20 per share for the first 9 months of 2023 or a 6% increase compared to the same period last year. As Vince noted, our teams have done a fantastic job of executing our plan and have positioned us well to offset the significantly unfavorable weather and storm impacts we experienced in the first half of the year to deliver the midpoint of our earnings forecast. And as outlined on our second quarter call, we expected to achieve this objective through several areas, which are being reflected in our year-to-date results.\n In Pennsylvania, the disc mechanism has already more than offset the sales volume and storm cost implications in this segment. Our Rhode Island integration continues to go well, and we've already achieved our targeted ongoing earnings forecast for the year, setting us up to achieve the $0.01 to $0.02 per share of outperformance that we discussed on the Q2 call. And finally, the team continues to focus on operating the business efficiently, and we expect to achieve at least our targeted O&M savings of $50 million to $60 million this year.\n We remain very confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast due to this excellent year-to-date performance and expect to build on our track record of achieving our financial targets. As a result, we have tightened our forecast range with just a few months remaining in the year and a clear path to deliver on our objectives. Moving to Slide 11, recognizing the current macroeconomic environment of higher interest rates, I want to emphasize our strong credit position, one that places PPL among the best in our sector. This is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility, and we continue to project strong credit metrics throughout our planning period despite the rising cost of new debt.\n This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and HoldCo to total debt ratio below 25%. During 2023, we've taken proactive steps to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates. This includes the financing activity that we completed during the first quarter which significantly reduced our floating rate exposure to less than 5% of our total debt portfolio. Looking forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk through 2025 and with 0 holding company maturities and just over $600 million of total utility maturities through that time frame. In fact, we have less than $2 billion or just 13% of our total debt portfolio maturing through 2027.\n Finally, we also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without requiring equity for the foreseeable future while maintaining excellent credit metrics. I'm extremely pleased with our position and outlook to execute our plan in this macro environment. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince. \nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, I'm proud of the work our team has done this year to keep us on track to deliver on our commitments to both customers and shareowners. As highlighted, we've narrowed our ongoing earnings forecast achieved significant success in offsetting this year's headwinds from mild weather and storms, and remain confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our earnings forecast of $1.58 per share.\n At the same time, we've continued to advance key regulatory proceedings, most recently achieving a positive outcome in our AMF filing in Rhode Island. I'm also proud of the rigorous generation replacement plan that our team developed and presented during the CPCN proceeding. A plan that is right for Kentucky. And while we believe our plan is the best plan forward for our customers, we remain confident we will be able to achieve our stated growth targets under a variety of outcomes in that case. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to proceed as planned, putting us on pace to exit all remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in 2024.\n We're on track to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments this year. And through the third quarter, we're ahead of plan in delivering $50 million to $60 million in targeted O&M savings to drive better value for customers and share owners alike. Across PPL, we continue to make progress in advancing our long-term vision to be the best utility company in the U.S. And I remain excited for our bright future that will continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Nick Campanella of Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: Hey, I just want to start right off the bat. Sorry if I missed it, but I know that there has been some sales volume declines this year. Obviously, higher interest rates is hurting everyone. To your point, no major maturities in '24, which is great across the business. But can you just confirm, as you kind of wrap this all together that you can continue to kind of grow the business from an EPS perspective linearly, '24 and '25? And how we should kind of think about that? \nJoe Bergstein: Yes. Hey Nick, it's Joe. Thanks for the question. Yes, we expect linear growth through our plan period, as we've talked about before. Obviously, there's market forces at place, as you mentioned, but we think that they're manageable and can deliver that linear growth. \nNicholas Campanella: That's helpful. And then I know that on the current plan today, there's no rate cases and you'll be staying out. But can you just help us understand what would force you to file if you had to in the next few years? Is it more dependent on current regulatory proposals in front of you in Rhode Island and Kentucky and how those go? Or is it more dictated by the size of the capital plan and ROEs? \nJoe Bergstein: Yes, sure. Well, you're right. In our current plan, we just have one rate case in Rhode Island in the back half of 2026. There's obviously a lot of factors that go into determining rate case timing, including -- and you named a few of them, capital plans, interest rates, regulatory lag on capital that doesn't run through some sort of mechanism and many, many more. We're going through our business planning process now, Nick, and we assess all of those factors as we do so. We'll provide views on what we think about rate case and potential timing when we give an update on our year-end call. \nNicholas Campanella: All right. Thanks a lot. We'll see you in Arizona. \nJoe Bergstein: Yes. Great. \nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: Let's see. With the CPCN, I was wondering, we've seen inflation across supply chains fairly broadly and a lot of components. Wondering if costs have risen for the solar that you're requesting and for the CCGTs that you've got in the plan in front of Kentucky since your initial filing. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, David, we have seen cost increases for the replacement generation plan. We updated all of that in our testimony for the commission. So they have the latest CapEx estimates for our plan. Those are confidential, so I can't disclose here at this time how much those went up. But even with those higher costs, where our analysis is showing that our proposed generation replacement plan is still significantly NPV positive and is, again, the best option that we're showing for customers. So the commission has all of that in the record as they're looking at it. \nDavid Arcaro: Yes, makes sense. So it's still economic, and I presume, so a higher CapEx essentially for kind of the full plan that's in front of the commission now. \nVincent Sorgi: That's correct. If the whole plan is approved, it would be incremental to what we have, yes. \nDavid Arcaro: Yes. Okay. Yes. And then as you look forward toward rolling the capital plan forward a year, should we expect equity to be incorporated into the financing strategy? Or is there still balance sheet headroom as you look out to add more CapEx and rate base growth? \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, Joe, do you want to talk about that? \nJoe Bergstein: Yes, sure. So as I talked about in my prepared remarks, Dave, the balance sheet is strong, and we expect to operate in that 16% to 18% FFO or CFO to debt range that we've been talking about. Clearly, we can finance the current capital plan without any need for equity even in today's market. We'll see as we roll the plan forward what that looks like. \n Clearly, we have needs for capital investment beyond what's in our plan and how that comes into view. But I feel really good about where our balance sheet is. The strength of the balance sheet and able to maintain our current credit ratings without the need for equity. \nOperator: Next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: So Vince, I know you mentioned that the O&M savings year-to-date is tracking ahead of the original forecast. It obviously was a key point of the talking points. I guess maybe taking that a step further, can you speak to how you're tracking for the total $175 million by '26. Is there room to exceed now that you've gone further into it? \nVincent Sorgi: Well, overall, Shar, we're tracking very well against the $175 million. So obviously, we have that layered in '24, '25, '26. Joe, I'll let you cover a little more detail on kind of the outperformance for '23. Of course, when we're looking at the additional storm costs and weather, those are anomalistic. And so some of the areas that we targeted to help offset that are things like open positions looking at our maintenance schedules, et cetera. So some of those things will not be permanent, Shar, but we're tracking very well on the $50 million to $60 million, which obviously are permanent on our way to the $175 million. \nJoe Bergstein: Yes, got it. I would just add that we -- as we talked about, we're on track to achieve at least the $50 million to $60 million of efficiencies this year, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve the $175 million. We have a robust pipeline of initiatives that we're working on. So the team has clearly been extremely focused on delivering on the initiatives that we've established, which is why we're tracking ahead. So we feel really good about where we are today and our ability to hit that $175 million. \nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then Vince, I know -- just to maybe reiterate our conversation from the prior call. I mean at this point, are you prepared to be flexible in your plans, depending on how the Kentucky PSC ultimately rules on the CPCN next week? Is that something, I guess, you will be prepared to talk about right after that at EEI? Or you have to wait for the 4Q update? \nVincent Sorgi: Sure. So from a communications perspective, Shar, in a very timely fashion, we'll respond to the decision coming out, what we expect would be next Monday. So you'll hear from us shortly after that. Of course, we'll see many of you all investors and analysts at the EEI Conference the week after that. So likely, I'll be able to get into more detail there. And then we'll do the full business plan update incorporating all of this plus all the other business plan refreshes at our normal cadence of the year-end call.\n As we think about the various outcomes of the CPCN, we've talked about this before. Based on all of the testimonials that's been filed, I don't see the outcome being an all or nothing situation regarding the coal plant retirements. But as we just think about the generation portfolio, I've talked about in the past that the CapEx that would be needed to run those plants safely and reliably if we do not retire them would be in that $500 million to $1.5 billion range, really depending on where we end up on the ELG regulations. The source of that is we have to put the maintenance capital for the 4 coal units back in. That would be a couple of hundred million dollars.\n We have a few SCRs that would have to go on some of the plants. So that's in the $300 million, $400 million range. There's some ancillary environmental upgrades that would also need to be done to keep these plants in compliance. That's about another $100 million. And then the ELG regs, as I said, can be quite a significant amount of investment. But on the low end of the range, we think the estimate there is likely around $150 million. Also just talked about the CCGTs. And if we were to get one and not both, right, there is some incremental CapEx there as the prices have gone up from what we had originally had in our plan.\n Beyond the generation portfolio, though, we continue to see the need for significant grid-enhancing investments in T&D, particularly transmission and especially in Kentucky. As we've talked about in the past, the large generation investments that we've been making in Kentucky have really resulted in less T&D investment there. However, the need there is great. And so we really need to start making those T&D investments, primarily transmission as soon as we can. So once we have the decision from the commission, we can factor all of these things into ultimately what the capital plan will look like as we update it.\n But we feel very confident that the investment needs are there, Shar. We can finance them with the balance sheet that we have that Joe talked about, not only finance them, but finance them without equity. And so it's why we're confident that we should be able to deliver our growth targets really under various scenarios that we might see next week. \nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So I only have 1 question about the fraudulent conveyance lawsuit from Talen. It's -- you guys have tried to have a dismiss. It goes back to 2014. We're talking about potentially very large amounts. And I just wonder if you have any comment. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, Angie, no real update since our last call. As you know, the trial date has been set for February of next year. We're looking forward to that trial. As we said all along, we fully believe the distribution of those proceeds were in compliance with all applicable laws, and we stand ready to vigorously defend that position. So nothing really, really new. It being in bankruptcy court, not surprising that some of our motions were not accepted. So not surprising there, but still feel very confident in our case.. \nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Bank of America. \nPaul Zimbardo: Just to follow up a little bit on the transmission opportunity side. I know you addressed Kentucky pretty well, but what about the Eastern side, the PJM footprint? Like I think there was like a $145 million award. And just holistically, if you could talk about some of the opportunities from Pennsylvania, PJM broadly transmission. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes. We'll continue to see opportunity for transmission investments in and throughout PJM to your point, that's an area that we think there's additional opportunity in PPL Electric Utilities, not only supporting within our territory, but also some of the solicitations that are happening to support constraints that are outside of our territory. And as you know, we're active in pursuing those. And so we'll continue to do that. To your point, I think there's additional opportunity beyond what's in the plan. \n We'll provide more color around that as we provide our fulsome capital updates and update the plan. But to your point, I definitely see transmission, not just in Kentucky as a real need, but also in Pennsylvania and even Rhode Island. \nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. And then another one, probably fairly obvious, but I just want to check the box there. On the long-term emphasis on long-term refinancing for cap funding, like you're assuming kind of a market interest rate on those maturities with the CAGR purposes? \nJoe Bergstein: We are, yes. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho, please go ahead. \nAnthony Crowdell: Just one quick one. You talked about the RFP for offshore wind in Rhode Island. Just curious how committed the state is to offshore wind, as you've noticed some other states, particularly New York seems to be bulking at the higher power prices. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes. Look, I think New England in general, Anthony, is committed right -- their strategy is heavily relying on offshore wind for their clean energy future. We're committed to helping certainly Rhode Island helped to achieve those goals. I think what you saw in New York was as much procedural as it is pricing, where I think the states have concerns just modifying existing PPAs without reopening those up for bid because you may get better pricing if you reopen them. So I think it's more process driven than it is just the price. \n Having said that, we rejected our original RFP due to price and other factors. So this latest RFP that we issued, we included an upsized RFP to 1,200 megawatts, which is a more efficient generation size for the developers versus the 800 plus that we had originally went out for -- we're allowing for a longer PPA term beyond 20 years. And then there's the possibility of a multistate solution with Massachusetts and Connecticut, as I talked about in my remarks. So hopefully, those things will be enough for the developers to bring the prices down for our customers. And at a level that both we and the state will be able to accept. So we'll see. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Levine of Citi. \nRyan Levine: Quick question. In terms of the 2.3% industrial load decline in Kentucky for the quarter on a weather-normalized basis, what was the driver of that? And what's your longer-term outlook for industrial growth in Kentucky ahead of the CPCN decision next Monday? \nJoe Bergstein: Yes. Ryan, it's Joe. Yes. The -- what you're talking about in Kentucky is that variance is really driven by one large steel manufacturer that's experiencing usage normalization after they saw a large spike during COVID. So they're just normalizing back to where they had been prior to that. And you're seeing that in the year-to-date or the quarterly variances. As we think about longer term for Kentucky, there's been -- and we've talked about it a number of times, significant economic development over the last 2 years or more really 2021 and 2022 at $10 billion of economic development each year.\n The state is expecting another $8 billion this year. It's not all in our service territory, but we're seeing a good portion of it coming to our service territory. So longer-term outlook remains positive for low growth in Kentucky. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes. And Ryan, generally, the industrial class, especially in Kentucky, the margins are not as affected by kilowatt hours as they're predominantly driven on demand and fixed charges. So as Joe said, that was pretty much one customer driving that, but very little impact on margin. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks. \nVincent Sorgi: Thanks, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. As I said, you'll hear from us next week following the decision from the KPSC on the CPCN and then look forward to seeing you all at EEI the following week. So thanks again for joining us. \nOperator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. PPL's third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.31 per share compared to $0.24 per share in Q3 2022.

Our Rhode Island integration continues to go well, and we've already achieved our targeted ongoing earnings forecast for the year, setting us up to achieve the $0.01 to $0.02 per share of outperformance that we discussed on the Q2 call. And finally, the team continues to focus on operating the business efficiently, and we expect to achieve at least our targeted O&M savings of $50 million to $60 million this year.\n We remain very confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast due to this excellent year-to-date performance and expect to build on our track record of achieving our financial targets. As a result, we have tightened our forecast range with just a few months remaining in the year and a clear path to deliver on our objectives. Moving to Slide 11, recognizing the current macroeconomic environment of higher interest rates, I want to emphasize our strong credit position, one that places PPL among the best in our sector. This is a clear strategic advantage that provides the company with significant financial flexibility, and we continue to project strong credit metrics throughout our planning period despite the rising cost of new debt.\n This includes maintaining a 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt ratio and HoldCo to total debt ratio below 25%. During 2023, we've taken proactive steps to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates. This includes the financing activity that we completed during the first quarter which significantly reduced our floating rate exposure to less than 5% of our total debt portfolio. Looking forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk through 2025 and with 0 holding company maturities and just over $600 million of total utility maturities through that time frame. In fact, we have less than $2 billion or just 13% of our total debt portfolio maturing through 2027.\n Finally, we also continue to be uniquely positioned to continue to fund our growth without requiring equity for the foreseeable future while maintaining excellent credit metrics. I'm extremely pleased with our position and outlook to execute our plan in this macro environment. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yes. Hey Nick, it's Joe. Thanks for the question. Yes, we expect linear growth through our plan period, as we've talked about before. Obviously, there's market forces at place, as you mentioned, but we think that they're manageable and can deliver that linear growth. Yes, sure. Well, you're right. In our current plan, we just have one rate case in Rhode Island in the back half of 2026. There's obviously a lot of factors that go into determining rate case timing, including -- and you named a few of them, capital plans, interest rates, regulatory lag on capital that doesn't run through some sort of mechanism and many, many more. We're going through our business planning process now, Nick, and we assess all of those factors as we do so. We'll provide views on what we think about rate case and potential timing when we give an update on our year-end call. Yes. Great. Yes, sure. So as I talked about in my prepared remarks, Dave, the balance sheet is strong, and we expect to operate in that 16% to 18% FFO or CFO to debt range that we've been talking about. Clearly, we can finance the current capital plan without any need for equity even in today's market. We'll see as we roll the plan forward what that looks like. \n Clearly, we have needs for capital investment beyond what's in our plan and how that comes into view. But I feel really good about where our balance sheet is. The strength of the balance sheet and able to maintain our current credit ratings without the need for equity. Yes, got it. I would just add that we -- as we talked about, we're on track to achieve at least the $50 million to $60 million of efficiencies this year, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve the $175 million. We have a robust pipeline of initiatives that we're working on. So the team has clearly been extremely focused on delivering on the initiatives that we've established, which is why we're tracking ahead. So we feel really good about where we are today and our ability to hit that $175 million. We are, yes. Yes. Ryan, it's Joe. Yes. The -- what you're talking about in Kentucky is that variance is really driven by one large steel manufacturer that's experiencing usage normalization after they saw a large spike during COVID. So they're just normalizing back to where they had been prior to that. And you're seeing that in the year-to-date or the quarterly variances. As we think about longer term for Kentucky, there's been -- and we've talked about it a number of times, significant economic development over the last 2 years or more really 2021 and 2022 at $10 billion of economic development each year.\n The state is expecting another $8 billion this year. It's not all in our service territory, but we're seeing a good portion of it coming to our service territory. So longer-term outlook remains positive for low growth in Kentucky."

            "name": "Vincent Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Let's start with an overview of our financial results on Slide 4. Today, we announced third quarter reported earnings of $0.31 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.43 per share compared with $0.41 per share a year ago. These results position us well to deliver our 2023 earnings guidance, despite the significant impact of mild weather and storms in the first half of the year.\n As Joe will cover in his financial review, we've been successful in overcoming these headwinds through effective regulatory mechanisms, our continued focus on operating efficiently and outperformance in several other areas. The team has done an outstanding job in keeping us on track to deliver our 2023 financial objectives, while providing energy safely and reliably to our customers. As a result of our progress through Q3, we have narrowed our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast range to $1.55 to $1.60 per share, with the midpoint of $1.58 per share unchanged.\n As we look to close out the year in a strong fashion, we also remain on track to invest nearly $2.5 billion to modernize the grid, strengthen grid resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix. In addition, we're on pace to achieve our targeted $50 million to $60 million in O&M efficiencies this year. Looking forward, we've reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rates of 6% to 8% through at least 2026 as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This growth is supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and cleaner energy future.\n We expect to fund this growth without the need for equity issuances through at least 2026, while maintaining superior credit metrics and one of the strongest balance sheets in our sector. Turning to Slide 5 and some operational highlights. We continue to deliver top quartile reliability and advanced industry-leading grid innovation that drives efficiency and improve service to our customers as we execute our utility in the future strategy. In support of this work, the Department of Energy has selected PPL Electric Utilities and Rhode Island Energy to receive a combined $100 million in federal funding for planned smart grid projects in our service territories.\n The projects that were selected by the DOE were generally included in our current capital plan. However, these grants will certainly help to support affordability for our customers, which we remain keenly focused on. Our Pennsylvania project will extend PPL Electric self-healing smart grid already one of the most sophisticated energy networks in the nation to further enhance great reliability and resiliency. Meanwhile, our Rhode Island project will accelerate Rhode Island Energy's investment in great resilience and smart grid capabilities to support the state's leading clean energy goals. The process to receive this funding through the IIJA was highly competitive. PPL was one of only a few companies to be selected for multiple awards in this initial round of funding.\n As we focus on creating the utilities of the future that are agile, innovative and technology enabled, we continue to be recognized for our leadership in the smart grid space. During the third quarter, PPL Electric Utilities received 2 additional awards for innovative, industry-leading work that has helped improve the safety, reliability and affordability of electricity delivered to our more than 1.5 million customers in Pennsylvania. Moving to Rhode Island. We remain focused on supporting Rhode Island's clean energy goals and bringing more affordable offshore wind opportunities to the state. On October 13, we issued an RFP to procure 1,200 megawatts of offshore wind to help power the state's energy needs.\n The RFP was the state's largest ever renewable energy solicitation and was issued just a week after Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island signed a memorandum of understanding, paving the way for a potential multistate selection of offshore wind opportunities. Each state is conducting procurements in a similar time frame and we're hopeful that our larger procurement, a streamlined application process, flexibility on contract durations and the potential for multistate coordination will provide better economies of scale for developers, and reasonable pricing options for our customers. Bids are due by January 31, with any resulting selection expected next summer. \n Many PPAs agreed to by Rhode Island Energy would be subject to review and approval by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. Lastly, on this slide, LG&E began contract negotiations a few weeks ago for a labor contract that expires on November 10. The contract covers more than 600 of our employees in Kentucky. For decades, we have successfully worked together with our unions in Kentucky to reach agreement, and we're optimistic we can continue that success. We look forward to continued progress over the coming days and weeks to achieve an outcome that balances the needs of our employees and our customers. And importantly, the company has completed its preparedness plan to ensure we can continue to deliver safe and reliable service to our customers should negotiations break down.\n Moving to Slide 6 for a couple of key regulatory updates. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace up to 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We continue to believe that our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. The Kentucky Public Service Commission conducted public hearings in August, followed by post-year increase in September. The hearings as well as the intervenor briefs have largely been as expected. And looking forward, we continue to expect a decision from the commission by November 6.\n Shifting to Rhode Island. In late September, we received regulatory approval to deploy advanced metering functionality statewide as we lay the foundation for a smarter, more resilient, reliable and dynamic grid that supports the state's leading climate goals. As part of its unanimous decision, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission authorized capital investments of up to $153 million for this initiative. We're pleased with the outcome of the commission's decision for this important project. Advanced metering functionality, which we've deployed in Pennsylvania and are currently deploying in Kentucky is a key step in modernizing our energy networks.\n And as we've seen in our other service territories, it delivers significant benefits for our customers. We expect to begin installing the digital meters in late 2024 and to complete the deployment over the next 3 years, capitalizing on our experience in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. These investments will also be largely recoverable through the annual ISR process in Rhode Island. That concludes my operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, I'm proud of the work our team has done this year to keep us on track to deliver on our commitments to both customers and shareowners. As highlighted, we've narrowed our ongoing earnings forecast achieved significant success in offsetting this year's headwinds from mild weather and storms, and remain confident in our ability to achieve the midpoint of our earnings forecast of $1.58 per share.\n At the same time, we've continued to advance key regulatory proceedings, most recently achieving a positive outcome in our AMF filing in Rhode Island. I'm also proud of the rigorous generation replacement plan that our team developed and presented during the CPCN proceeding. A plan that is right for Kentucky. And while we believe our plan is the best plan forward for our customers, we remain confident we will be able to achieve our stated growth targets under a variety of outcomes in that case. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to proceed as planned, putting us on pace to exit all remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in 2024.\n We're on track to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments this year. And through the third quarter, we're ahead of plan in delivering $50 million to $60 million in targeted O&M savings to drive better value for customers and share owners alike. Across PPL, we continue to make progress in advancing our long-term vision to be the best utility company in the U.S. And I remain excited for our bright future that will continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, David, we have seen cost increases for the replacement generation plan. We updated all of that in our testimony for the commission. So they have the latest CapEx estimates for our plan. Those are confidential, so I can't disclose here at this time how much those went up. But even with those higher costs, where our analysis is showing that our proposed generation replacement plan is still significantly NPV positive and is, again, the best option that we're showing for customers. So the commission has all of that in the record as they're looking at it. That's correct. If the whole plan is approved, it would be incremental to what we have, yes. Yes, Joe, do you want to talk about that? Well, overall, Shar, we're tracking very well against the $175 million. So obviously, we have that layered in '24, '25, '26. Joe, I'll let you cover a little more detail on kind of the outperformance for '23. Of course, when we're looking at the additional storm costs and weather, those are anomalistic. And so some of the areas that we targeted to help offset that are things like open positions looking at our maintenance schedules, et cetera. So some of those things will not be permanent, Shar, but we're tracking very well on the $50 million to $60 million, which obviously are permanent on our way to the $175 million. Sure. So from a communications perspective, Shar, in a very timely fashion, we'll respond to the decision coming out, what we expect would be next Monday. So you'll hear from us shortly after that. Of course, we'll see many of you all investors and analysts at the EEI Conference the week after that. So likely, I'll be able to get into more detail there. And then we'll do the full business plan update incorporating all of this plus all the other business plan refreshes at our normal cadence of the year-end call.\n As we think about the various outcomes of the CPCN, we've talked about this before. Based on all of the testimonials that's been filed, I don't see the outcome being an all or nothing situation regarding the coal plant retirements. But as we just think about the generation portfolio, I've talked about in the past that the CapEx that would be needed to run those plants safely and reliably if we do not retire them would be in that $500 million to $1.5 billion range, really depending on where we end up on the ELG regulations. The source of that is we have to put the maintenance capital for the 4 coal units back in. That would be a couple of hundred million dollars.\n We have a few SCRs that would have to go on some of the plants. So that's in the $300 million, $400 million range. There's some ancillary environmental upgrades that would also need to be done to keep these plants in compliance. That's about another $100 million. And then the ELG regs, as I said, can be quite a significant amount of investment. But on the low end of the range, we think the estimate there is likely around $150 million. Also just talked about the CCGTs. And if we were to get one and not both, right, there is some incremental CapEx there as the prices have gone up from what we had originally had in our plan.\n Beyond the generation portfolio, though, we continue to see the need for significant grid-enhancing investments in T&D, particularly transmission and especially in Kentucky. As we've talked about in the past, the large generation investments that we've been making in Kentucky have really resulted in less T&D investment there. However, the need there is great. And so we really need to start making those T&D investments, primarily transmission as soon as we can. So once we have the decision from the commission, we can factor all of these things into ultimately what the capital plan will look like as we update it.\n But we feel very confident that the investment needs are there, Shar. We can finance them with the balance sheet that we have that Joe talked about, not only finance them, but finance them without equity. And so it's why we're confident that we should be able to deliver our growth targets really under various scenarios that we might see next week. Yes, Angie, no real update since our last call. As you know, the trial date has been set for February of next year. We're looking forward to that trial. As we said all along, we fully believe the distribution of those proceeds were in compliance with all applicable laws, and we stand ready to vigorously defend that position. So nothing really, really new. It being in bankruptcy court, not surprising that some of our motions were not accepted. So not surprising there, but still feel very confident in our case.. Yes. We'll continue to see opportunity for transmission investments in and throughout PJM to your point, that's an area that we think there's additional opportunity in PPL Electric Utilities, not only supporting within our territory, but also some of the solicitations that are happening to support constraints that are outside of our territory. And as you know, we're active in pursuing those. And so we'll continue to do that. To your point, I think there's additional opportunity beyond what's in the plan. \n We'll provide more color around that as we provide our fulsome capital updates and update the plan. But to your point, I definitely see transmission, not just in Kentucky as a real need, but also in Pennsylvania and even Rhode Island. Yes. Look, I think New England in general, Anthony, is committed right -- their strategy is heavily relying on offshore wind for their clean energy future. We're committed to helping certainly Rhode Island helped to achieve those goals. I think what you saw in New York was as much procedural as it is pricing, where I think the states have concerns just modifying existing PPAs without reopening those up for bid because you may get better pricing if you reopen them. So I think it's more process driven than it is just the price. \n Having said that, we rejected our original RFP due to price and other factors. So this latest RFP that we issued, we included an upsized RFP to 1,200 megawatts, which is a more efficient generation size for the developers versus the 800 plus that we had originally went out for -- we're allowing for a longer PPA term beyond 20 years. And then there's the possibility of a multistate solution with Massachusetts and Connecticut, as I talked about in my remarks. So hopefully, those things will be enough for the developers to bring the prices down for our customers. And at a level that both we and the state will be able to accept. So we'll see. Yes. And Ryan, generally, the industrial class, especially in Kentucky, the margins are not as affected by kilowatt hours as they're predominantly driven on demand and fixed charges. So as Joe said, that was pretty much one customer driving that, but very little impact on margin. Thanks, operator, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. As I said, you'll hear from us next week following the decision from the KPSC on the CPCN and then look forward to seeing you all at EEI the following week. So thanks again for joining us."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on second quarter 2023 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we\u2019ll conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I\u2019ll draw your attention to Slide 2 in a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL\u2019s SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures including earnings from ongoing operations on this call. For reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let\u2019s start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.15 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Overall, second quarter results were in line with our expectations apart from the continued mild weather and storm activity in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as this has been one of the most active storm years we\u2019ve ever experienced. Between the mild weather and storm O&M, our year-to-date results were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per share compared to our original plan. But despite these impacts, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. We have identified several areas in which we can offset the headwinds from weather and storms, and Joe will cover that in detail in his financial review. As you know, one area we remain extremely focused on is O&M, and we are on track to achieve the $50 million to $60 million targeted reductions this year. And despite the incremental storm expenses, we are tracking slightly ahead of our O&M forecast through June. We expect that trend to continue and improve through the second half of the year. In addition, today, we reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rate of 6% to 8% through at least 2026, as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This will be supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and clean energy future. Turning to a few second quarter operational highlights. We continue to deliver excellent reliability for our customers across our jurisdiction, again, despite the increased storm activity in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. This is a direct result of our ongoing investments, not only in system hardening that prevents outages, but also smart grid technology and automation that enables us to respond more quickly when outages do occur. On the integration of Rhode Island Energy, we remain well positioned to complete our transition services with National Grid next year. We also continue to make progress on an important filing before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, as we seek to deploy advanced metering functionality across our service territory and build a smarter grid that supports the state\u2019s leading climate goals. Hearings before the Rhode Island PUC were held in late July to review our business case and cost recovery proposals. We expect a decision on our AMF filing later this fall. We also remain on track with the Kentucky CPCN process, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail on the next slide. Finally, we continue to receive awards for our industry-leading approach in grid innovation as both the Edison Electric Institute and the Southeastern Electric Exchange recognized PPL Electric Utilities for its groundbreaking use of dynamic line rating technology. PPL Electric is the first utility in the nation to integrate this technology with its transmission management system. DLR sensors provide real-time information that enables us to better utilize our existing transmission line capacity and reduce gestion on the grid. FERC has also recognized the value that this technology can bring to the industry and better managing congestion on the transmission network. Turning to Slide 5 and an update on the CPCN process in Kentucky. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace 1,500 megawatt of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We remain confident our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. In May, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our request to consolidate the CPCN filing and our generation retirement request as required by Senate Bill 4. The commission approved the consolidation while keeping the CPCN procedural schedule largely unchanged. For the schedule, intervenor testimony was filed July 14 with no real surprises. Next up is our rebuttal testimony due August 9, followed by an info conference scheduled for August 15 to explore a potential settlement. Public hearings are then set to begin August 22 and could last several days. Again, we are very confident that the plan we\u2019ve proposed is in our customers and the state\u2019s best interest but we are also open to settlement discussions with the parties to the case. Ultimately, with or without a settlement, we anticipate a decision on our filings from the commission by November 6. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. As Vince mentioned, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in Q2 2022. The Primary drivers of $0.01 per share decline from last year were lower sales volumes in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania driven by mild weather and as expected in our plan higher interest expense due to increased borrowings at higher interest rates to fund our growth. Those factors were partially offset by lower O&M expense, driven by our continued focus on operating efficiency and improved earnings at the Rhode Island segment from 2 additional months of results in Q2 2023 compared to the prior year. Overall, our teams performed well for the quarter and results were slightly ahead of expectations, apart from the mild weather, which impacted results by $0.03 per share compared to our forecast. Degree days were lower by more than 20% in our Kentucky service territory and by over 35% in Pennsylvania. This resulted in lower actual electricity sales volumes of 4% in Kentucky and 8% Pennsylvania compared to normal. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense partially offset by higher transmission revenue and higher distribution rider recovery. Our Kentucky segment results decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by the lower sales volumes and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year, reflecting the additional 2 months of earnings this quarter. Finally, results at Corporate & Other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expense and other factors that were not individually significant partially offset by higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 9. Our Q2 performance puts PPL\u2019s GAAP earnings at $0.54 per share year-to-date through June 30. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.77 per share for the first half of 2023. Mild weather has unfavorably impacted our year-to-date results by a total of about $0.08 per share compared to our plan due to lower sales volumes. In addition, we have experienced higher storm-related costs of about $0.01 per share compared to our plan so far this year due to the significant storm activity. Importantly, we\u2019ve been able to more than offset these increased storm costs and we are tracking favorably to plan on O&M through the second quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast as we expect to offset the unfavorable weather and storm impacts due to the projected outperformance in several areas. First, the disc mechanism in Pennsylvania is projected to offset the lower sales volumes and higher O&M experience in that segment. Second, we are tracking favorably on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, which we expect to provide upside compared to our plan. Third, the convertible debt financing that we executed in the first quarter will reduce our annual interest expense relative to our plan. And finally, we continue to optimize our discretionary O&M. This includes contractor and consultant spend, and the timing of filling open positions and other discretionary O&M spend. In total, these identified offsets present a clear path to achieving the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. We have an excellent track record of achieving our financial targets, which we expect to continue in 2023. Looking ahead and our plans to achieve at least $175 million of O&M efficiencies by 2026, we established a Transformation Management Office or TMO, to ensure we achieve our long-term efficiency objectives. The TMO, which I chair, with support from our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Information Officer, and with the engagement from our employees across the entire company is responsible for tracking our progress on savings initiatives as well as identifying and verifying additional areas of possible savings. To date, we have identified over 100 initiatives with savings potential significantly above our $175 million target. This structure and rigorous process gives us even more confidence that we will achieve the targeted savings assumed in our long-term forecast and it will help us deliver a more affordable clean energy transition for our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, we remain confident in achieving our goals for 2023. While mild weather and storms have created some headwinds, we have plans in place to overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to share owners. We\u2019re also on target to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure improvements to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to go smoothly. We continue to progress our regulatory filings in both Kentucky and Rhode Island. And last but not least, we\u2019re solidly on track to deliver our targeted O&M savings as we execute our Utility of the Future playbook, incorporate more technology and automation and centralized various functions across PPL to deliver better value for customers and share owners alike. With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, guys. Pretty straightforward quarter here. I had two housekeeping questions. First, can you quantify what\u2019s the AMI ask in Rhode Island? How much investment that is?\nVince Sorgi: We\u2019re in the $200 million range Durgesh?\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And over what time frame?\nVince Sorgi: $250 million somewhere around there. Sorry, say that again?\nDurgesh Chopra: Sorry. Thank you. Over what time frame is that $200 million to $250 million?\nVince Sorgi: Well, we need to get that approved, right? So we just went through the hearings late last month. We expect to have a decision by the commission up there in the fall of this year. And then that will kind of dictate the time frame over which we deploy that capital.\nDurgesh Chopra: Would that be incremental to your current CapEx plan wins? Or do you have some...\nVince Sorgi: No, that\u2019s in the current plan.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then just in terms of the offsetting the year-date headwinds and weather and storm, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you mentioned like integration savings. Can you elaborate on that? How brings that pie obviously, it sounds like a lot of opportunities in excess of $175 million. But maybe just like what\u2019s the upside on the integration and Rhode Island and what might be the other opportunities?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. So the integration in Rhode Island Durgesh is going very well. Really, what we\u2019re \u2013 have been able to do is exit TSAs quicker than we had expected and at a lower cost which is driving a lot of the outperformance we\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re also mindful of the pace at which we\u2019re hiring some of the open positions we have there. So we\u2019re fully staffing up that operations and looking to take over completely from grid. And so those are the areas that are driving the Rhode Island integration. We would expect that to be about $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. As far as the progress on the $175 million and the establishment of the TMO, that\u2019s going extremely well. As I noted, we have over 100 initiatives totaling more than $175 million. Really, it\u2019s driven by significant employee engagement as we\u2019re developing tends to implement and achieve the $175 million, the TMO also provides a forum for employees to share their ideas, areas that we could save on O&M and be more efficient across the company. So I don\u2019t want to give a dollar amount on that yet at this point as to where we are. We \u2013 part of the process of that brings a lot of rigor to the savings, we got to vet them all to complete business cases where needed. What I can tell you is that we are confident in achieving the $175 million and potentially more than that and the development of the TMO really is even enhanced that confidence as we\u2019re working through this.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning, team. Thanks. Just to follow-up on that last question of Durgesh quickly. Is the TMO and those savings more about derisking and extending the outlook? Or is that something that could be incremental in the planning period?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes. So we will have to go through all of those items. I mean, it certainly de-risk and give us confidence in the $175 million through the planning period, whether those items that are in excess of the $175 million we will have to see whether they come into this period for execution, whether they are longer-dated items. And look, there is headwinds that we have to offset as well. We still see inflation and interest rates. So we have a bank of ideas and opportunities to execute on should we see those headwinds persist or increase, and then it just gives us confidence in the near-term to achieve the $175 and the 6% to 8% earnings growth, and it gives us confidence in the longer-term to continue to execute on the strategy.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. I would reiterate that, Paul. I think it gives us both, right? Certainly, shores up the confidence in the $175 million, but likely gives us upside potential looking beyond that.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thank you. Very clear. And then switching topics. I noticed the weather-normalized sales volumes were decently down in the quarter and now trailing 12 months, both Pennsylvania, Kentucky. Just could you give any color on what you\u2019re seeing on the ground and just expectations for the second half of the year?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, sure. So well, from a second half of the year, we would expect we have in our forecast normal weather. From our longer-term forecast, we continue 50 basis points of sale of the growth in our plans in total and we continue to be \u2013 believe that, that\u2019s an achievable growth forecast. Some of the near-term impact that we\u2019re seeing, particularly on the residential side has been due to energy conservation with the rising commodity prices. I would expect that to be a shorter-term anomaly given that we\u2019ve seen a significant decline in commodity prices already this year and we would expect longer-term to see growth in residential usage as electric vehicles and electrification becomes more prevalent. Lower industrial sales in Kentucky have not really impacted our margins. Those customers more are demand-driven than usage. As we think about longer-term, there is a number of factors that give us confidence in our assumptions. We continue to see positive economic factors in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued flow unemployment rates and strong GDP growth. As we\u2019ve discussed in numerous times in Kentucky, we\u2019re coming off of back-to-back record years of economic development of over $10 billion of ounce investments in each of \u201821 and \u201822. That includes the Ford EV battery plant initiative, which we\u2019ve talked a lot about. That\u2019s broken ground and well under construction. The state is targeting another $8 billion of investment for 2023. So when we look at the 10 years prior to this period from 2010 to 2020, there was an average of about $4 billion per year in economic development. So to see $10 billion in each of \u201821 and \u201822 and projecting $8 billion this year highlights the Kentucky is a great place to do business and continued economic development there in support of our growth assumptions. But we continue to see strong industrial growth in manufacturing and agricultural sectors as well.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. We\u2019re not concerned with volumes at all other than the impact on weather. I would say our volume story is really weather-driven.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detailed answer. Appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi. Good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Hi David. Good morning.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Let\u2019s see. I think just one here. I was curious, we are starting to see some easing of supply chain pressures in the solar industry, commodity costs coming down, module prices declining somewhat and PPA prices easing. I was just wondering if you think that could impact at all the outlook for your Kentucky, just the generation mix maybe longer term, or other opportunities to see lower PPA prices or lower costs in the current CPCN filing or if you\u2019re thinking an analysis has evolved at all for the longer term generation mix there?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Look, I think the bigger issue in getting our solar deployed in Kentucky is citing and permitting days as opposed to necessarily the supply chain issues, although you are right, they have been an issue across the industry, and that is starting to abate. In our case, though I think it is more citing and permitting, which I think the company-owned solutions make that much easier because we can navigate that easier than third-party developers have been able to so far. So, as you know, our CPCN has a combination of company-owned and PPAs in it. We will continue to look at the executability of those PPAs and that if we continue to see issues there that could actually push us more to recommending more company-owned where we have a higher degree of confidence that we can get them built.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. I didn\u2019t appreciate that in the backdrop there. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey. Good morning guys.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. So, Vince, I just want to \u2013 starting with the Kentucky CPCN filing. I mean, obviously, thanks for the incremental color in the prepared on the timeline. As we look ahead to the prospects for settlement. You mentioned August 15th formal conference. I guess what could that look like? Is it partial, maybe the gas, but not the renewables? Just any additional color on how to think about that would be great.\nVince Sorgi: Well, look, I think you can appreciate, I don\u2019t necessarily want to get into negotiating positions at this point on the call. But what I will say just around the process itself is we are actively engaged right now with various interveners. As you mentioned, the settlement conference is scheduled for the 15th, if that goes well, and we can get settlement on at least significant issues in the case with enough parties. Then we may be able to present a stipulation to the PSC for their consideration. As you know, the hearings are scheduled to begin on the 22nd of August. That could become a forum for the PSC to take up the settlement agreement, if we\u2019re able to reach one. But at this point, I would say, Shar, it\u2019s too early to tell if we will be able to reach a settlement. But if we don\u2019t, of course, we are ready to defend the plan as filed, as we have been indicating all along. So, a little early at this point to tell if we can get there, but certainly, we are open to those discussions.\nShar Pourreza: So, let me just drill down a little bit on the defending side. In the off chance there are issues with the CPCN, right? Do you \u2013 I guess Vince, do you have avenues, either through pollution control or T&D work to offset that space in your CapEx plan, I guess in a scenario where there is issues. And then do me a favor, could you just maybe frame what \u2013 how much of that CapEx you could see being backfilled, right, in that worst-case scenario?\nVince Sorgi: Well, look, I think the key takeaway is I am not sure I would expect whether we have a settlement or fully litigating our case that, that would have a material impact on either our capital plan or our EPS targets given the different buckets of CapEx, whether it\u2019s building replacement generation or environmental spend or other types of CapEx that we might deploy in Kentucky and elsewhere across the fleet. If you look at the testimony and based on everything that\u2019s been filed to-date, I don\u2019t think the outcome, Shar, is going to be an all or nothing on the coal plant retirement. But when you look at the Good Neighbor Plan, which was consistent with what we were assuming in the CPCN, that would require SCRs on Gen 2, Mill Creek 1, Mill Creek 2, also a new cooling tower at Mill Creek 1. When you look at the MATS regs and the ELG regulations, especially the ELG regs, that could result in significant incremental investments if we were required to do so. So, even if it was a full rejection of the retirements, which again, I don\u2019t think that will be the outcome. As we have talked in the past, that\u2019s in the $500 million to $1.5 billion of environmental CapEx. That doesn\u2019t even include the amount of maintenance capital we have to spend on those plants going forward. So, again, I am not sure the outcome necessarily impacts the CapEx and EPS trajectory. It might just be different buckets where we are spending that capital.\nShar Pourreza: And then just lastly, that bucket you are going to be spending that capital. This is obviously the worst case scenario, so no ones are assuming this. But in the case that it does turn out to be negative, that incremental capital doesn\u2019t have a timing lag, right? So, you can go ahead and recognize it fairly immediately where we wouldn\u2019t keep divits in your earnings growth in the near-term.\nVince Sorgi: Some of that CapEx would have to \u2013 we would have to start spending that right away to continue to operate those plants. And that, to your point, that would be recoverable under the environmental cost recovery, which does not require a base rate case for recovery.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Have a great weekend. Appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hey Greg.\nGregg Orrill: Hey. Yes. Thanks. This may be repetitive. I know you said that the testimony from intervenors was kind of in line with expectations. Did you learn anything about their positions that was incremental to the process that \u2013 or the process itself that you are willing to share?\nVince Sorgi: Not really, Gregg. I would say the testimony was as expected. I think we talked about expected intervener positions when we rolled out the plan that we filed. So, we knew the coal association would be against retiring coal. We knew the environmental intervenors would be pushing more renewables. Again, our plan, we think balances all of those interests. But more importantly, it complies with SB-4, it complies with our obligations to serve lease cost, reliable, safe energy. It is increasingly cleaner which we are hearing a lot from our customers and from our two major cities in Louisville and Lexington. So, we were extremely thoughtful and took a lot of actually intervene or input from the IRP process into coming up with what we proposed. As I have talked about, however, we are willing to engage in settlement discussions with the parties, and we will see if we can reach something here in the next couple of weeks going into the hearings beginning on the 22nd. So, I would say, as expected and we incorporated most, if not all of that into the original plan that we filed with the commission.\nGregg Orrill: Alright. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Good morning Vince. Good morning Joe.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning.\nAnthony Crowdell: I just wanted to follow-up on Shar\u2019s question just one, and I am not sure you can answer it. Do you know if the commission in Kentucky would prefer the parties reach a settlement or given maybe with the closure of plants or whatever, that they are more buyers or they prefer a fully litigated track to have maybe a stronger record?\nVince Sorgi: I don\u2019t know that they have a preference one way or the other. Anthony, to be honest with you, they are going to uphold their obligation to ensure whether it\u2019s a settlement or our case that it meets the requirements of SB-4 and again, our obligation to serve in a lease cost reliable way. So, they are going to do their duty regardless of what\u2019s in front of them, whether it\u2019s a settlement or our case. Not sure if they have a preference on which one is in front of them. I mean they will take a settlement as evidence in the case. They don\u2019t have to approve the settlement, but they will certainly take it as evidence in the case. The authority really lies with them in terms of whether or not to accept that or not.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just lastly, I believe the company has been successful in reaching settlements in the past in Kentucky. Has \u2013 I guess my memory is getting a little foggy. I believe the commission has approved those settlements and not modified them. Is that accurate?\nVince Sorgi: So, you are right. Generally, we have been able to reach settlement with the parties to our cases. The commission has modified them slightly in the past, nothing to material. At times, they have accepted them as filed. And other times, they have modified them, I would say, slightly.\nAnthony Crowdell: Good. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: I just want to say thanks for joining us on the call. Feeling good about our progress so far year-to-date, looking forward to the second half of the year. And have a great weekend everyone and we will see you soon at the next conference.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we announced second quarter reported earnings of $0.15 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared with $0.30 per share a year ago. Overall, second quarter results were in line with our expectations apart from the continued mild weather and storm activity in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, as this has been one of the most active storm years we've ever experienced. Between the mild weather and storm O&M, our year-to-date results were negatively impacted by about $0.09 per share compared to our original plan. But despite these impacts, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. We have identified several areas in which we can offset the headwinds from weather and storms, and Joe will cover that in detail in his financial review. As you know, one area we remain extremely focused on is O&M, and we are on track to achieve the $50 million to $60 million targeted reductions this year. And despite the incremental storm expenses, we are tracking slightly ahead of our O&M forecast through June. We expect that trend to continue and improve through the second half of the year. In addition, today, we reaffirmed our projected earnings per share and dividend growth rate of 6% to 8% through at least 2026, as we remain confident in our low-risk business plan. This will be supported by our $12 billion capital investment plan and targeted O&M savings of at least $175 million by 2026 to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and clean energy future. Turning to a few second quarter operational highlights. We continue to deliver excellent reliability for our customers across our jurisdiction, again, despite the increased storm activity in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania. This is a direct result of our ongoing investments, not only in system hardening that prevents outages, but also smart grid technology and automation that enables us to respond more quickly when outages do occur. On the integration of Rhode Island Energy, we remain well positioned to complete our transition services with National Grid next year. We also continue to make progress on an important filing before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, as we seek to deploy advanced metering functionality across our service territory and build a smarter grid that supports the state's leading climate goals. Hearings before the Rhode Island PUC were held in late July to review our business case and cost recovery proposals. We expect a decision on our AMF filing later this fall. We also remain on track with the Kentucky CPCN process, which I'll cover in more detail on the next slide. Finally, we continue to receive awards for our industry-leading approach in grid innovation as both the Edison Electric Institute and the Southeastern Electric Exchange recognized PPL Electric Utilities for its groundbreaking use of dynamic line rating technology. PPL Electric is the first utility in the nation to integrate this technology with its transmission management system. DLR sensors provide real-time information that enables us to better utilize our existing transmission line capacity and reduce gestion on the grid. FERC has also recognized the value that this technology can bring to the industry and better managing congestion on the transmission network. Turning to Slide 5 and an update on the CPCN process in Kentucky. We remain focused on advancing our generation investment plan as we seek to replace 1,500 megawatt of aging coal generation with an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy mix by 2028. We remain confident our plan represents the best path forward for our Kentucky customers. As proposed, it would replace several 1970s era coal units with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, it would establish more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs. In May, the Kentucky Public Service Commission approved our request to consolidate the CPCN filing and our generation retirement request as required by Senate Bill 4. The commission approved the consolidation while keeping the CPCN procedural schedule largely unchanged. For the schedule, intervenor testimony was filed July 14 with no real surprises. Next up is our rebuttal testimony due August 9, followed by an info conference scheduled for August 15 to explore a potential settlement. Public hearings are then set to begin August 22 and could last several days. Again, we are very confident that the plan we've proposed is in our customers and the state's best interest but we are also open to settlement discussions with the parties to the case. Ultimately, with or without a settlement, we anticipate a decision on our filings from the commission by November 6. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, we remain confident in achieving our goals for 2023. While mild weather and storms have created some headwinds, we have plans in place to overcome those challenges and deliver on our commitments to share owners. We're also on target to complete more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure improvements to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers. Our integration of Rhode Island Energy continues to go smoothly. We continue to progress our regulatory filings in both Kentucky and Rhode Island. And last but not least, we're solidly on track to deliver our targeted O&M savings as we execute our Utility of the Future playbook, incorporate more technology and automation and centralized various functions across PPL to deliver better value for customers and share owners alike. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. We're in the $200 million range Durgesh? $250 million somewhere around there. Sorry, say that again? Well, we need to get that approved, right? So we just went through the hearings late last month. We expect to have a decision by the commission up there in the fall of this year. And then that will kind of dictate the time frame over which we deploy that capital. No, that's in the current plan. Thanks, Durgesh. Yes. I would reiterate that, Paul. I think it gives us both, right? Certainly, shores up the confidence in the $175 million, but likely gives us upside potential looking beyond that. Yes. We're not concerned with volumes at all other than the impact on weather. I would say our volume story is really weather-driven. Sure. Hi David. Good morning. Yes. Look, I think the bigger issue in getting our solar deployed in Kentucky is citing and permitting days as opposed to necessarily the supply chain issues, although you are right, they have been an issue across the industry, and that is starting to abate. In our case, though I think it is more citing and permitting, which I think the company-owned solutions make that much easier because we can navigate that easier than third-party developers have been able to so far.

It might just be different buckets where we are spending that capital. Some of that CapEx would have to \u2013 we would have to start spending that right away to continue to operate those plants. And that, to your point, that would be recoverable under the environmental cost recovery, which does not require a base rate case for recovery. Thanks. Hey Greg. Not really, Gregg.

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 7. As Vince mentioned, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.29 per share compared to $0.30 per share in Q2 2022. The Primary drivers of $0.01 per share decline from last year were lower sales volumes in both Kentucky and Pennsylvania driven by mild weather and as expected in our plan higher interest expense due to increased borrowings at higher interest rates to fund our growth. Those factors were partially offset by lower O&M expense, driven by our continued focus on operating efficiency and improved earnings at the Rhode Island segment from 2 additional months of results in Q2 2023 compared to the prior year. Overall, our teams performed well for the quarter and results were slightly ahead of expectations, apart from the mild weather, which impacted results by $0.03 per share compared to our forecast. Degree days were lower by more than 20% in our Kentucky service territory and by over 35% in Pennsylvania. This resulted in lower actual electricity sales volumes of 4% in Kentucky and 8% Pennsylvania compared to normal. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 8. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by lower sales volumes and higher interest expense partially offset by higher transmission revenue and higher distribution rider recovery. Our Kentucky segment results decreased by $0.03 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by the lower sales volumes and higher interest expense, partially offset by lower O&M expense. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.02 per share year-over-year, reflecting the additional 2 months of earnings this quarter. Finally, results at Corporate & Other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expense and other factors that were not individually significant partially offset by higher interest expense. Moving to Slide 9. Our Q2 performance puts PPL's GAAP earnings at $0.54 per share year-to-date through June 30. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.77 per share for the first half of 2023. Mild weather has unfavorably impacted our year-to-date results by a total of about $0.08 per share compared to our plan due to lower sales volumes. In addition, we have experienced higher storm-related costs of about $0.01 per share compared to our plan so far this year due to the significant storm activity. Importantly, we've been able to more than offset these increased storm costs and we are tracking favorably to plan on O&M through the second quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our 2023 earnings forecast as we expect to offset the unfavorable weather and storm impacts due to the projected outperformance in several areas. First, the disc mechanism in Pennsylvania is projected to offset the lower sales volumes and higher O&M experience in that segment. Second, we are tracking favorably on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, which we expect to provide upside compared to our plan. Third, the convertible debt financing that we executed in the first quarter will reduce our annual interest expense relative to our plan. And finally, we continue to optimize our discretionary O&M. This includes contractor and consultant spend, and the timing of filling open positions and other discretionary O&M spend. In total, these identified offsets present a clear path to achieving the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast of $1.58 per share. We have an excellent track record of achieving our financial targets, which we expect to continue in 2023. Looking ahead and our plans to achieve at least $175 million of O&M efficiencies by 2026, we established a Transformation Management Office or TMO, to ensure we achieve our long-term efficiency objectives. The TMO, which I chair, with support from our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Information Officer, and with the engagement from our employees across the entire company is responsible for tracking our progress on savings initiatives as well as identifying and verifying additional areas of possible savings. To date, we have identified over 100 initiatives with savings potential significantly above our $175 million target. This structure and rigorous process gives us even more confidence that we will achieve the targeted savings assumed in our long-term forecast and it will help us deliver a more affordable clean energy transition for our customers. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yes. So the integration in Rhode Island Durgesh is going very well. Really, what we're \u2013 have been able to do is exit TSAs quicker than we had expected and at a lower cost which is driving a lot of the outperformance we're seeing there. We're also mindful of the pace at which we're hiring some of the open positions we have there. So we're fully staffing up that operations and looking to take over completely from grid. And so those are the areas that are driving the Rhode Island integration. We would expect that to be about $0.01 to $0.02 for the year. As far as the progress on the $175 million and the establishment of the TMO, that's going extremely well. As I noted, we have over 100 initiatives totaling more than $175 million. Really, it's driven by significant employee engagement as we're developing tends to implement and achieve the $175 million, the TMO also provides a forum for employees to share their ideas, areas that we could save on O&M and be more efficient across the company. So I don't want to give a dollar amount on that yet at this point as to where we are. We \u2013 part of the process of that brings a lot of rigor to the savings, we got to vet them all to complete business cases where needed. What I can tell you is that we are confident in achieving the $175 million and potentially more than that and the development of the TMO really is even enhanced that confidence as we're working through this. Yes. So we will have to go through all of those items. I mean, it certainly de-risk and give us confidence in the $175 million through the planning period, whether those items that are in excess of the $175 million we will have to see whether they come into this period for execution, whether they are longer-dated items. And look, there is headwinds that we have to offset as well. We still see inflation and interest rates. So we have a bank of ideas and opportunities to execute on should we see those headwinds persist or increase, and then it just gives us confidence in the near-term to achieve the $175 and the 6% to 8% earnings growth, and it gives us confidence in the longer-term to continue to execute on the strategy. Yes, sure. So well, from a second half of the year, we would expect we have in our forecast normal weather. From our longer-term forecast, we continue 50 basis points of sale of the growth in our plans in total and we continue to be \u2013 believe that, that's an achievable growth forecast. Some of the near-term impact that we're seeing, particularly on the residential side has been due to energy conservation with the rising commodity prices. I would expect that to be a shorter-term anomaly given that we've seen a significant decline in commodity prices already this year and we would expect longer-term to see growth in residential usage as electric vehicles and electrification becomes more prevalent. Lower industrial sales in Kentucky have not really impacted our margins. Those customers more are demand-driven than usage. As we think about longer-term, there is a number of factors that give us confidence in our assumptions. We continue to see positive economic factors in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued flow unemployment rates and strong GDP growth. As we've discussed in numerous times in Kentucky, we're coming off of back-to-back record years of economic development of over $10 billion of ounce investments in each of \u201821 and \u201822. That includes the Ford EV battery plant initiative, which we've talked a lot about. That's broken ground and well under construction. The state is targeting another $8 billion of investment for 2023. So when we look at the 10 years prior to this period from 2010 to 2020, there was an average of about $4 billion per year in economic development. So to see $10 billion in each of \u201821 and \u201822 and projecting $8 billion this year highlights the Kentucky is a great place to do business and continued economic development there in support of our growth assumptions. But we continue to see strong industrial growth in manufacturing and agricultural sectors as well."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andy Ludwig, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on first quarter 2023 financial results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations and adjusted gross margins on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter Investor Update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4.  Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.39 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.48 per share compared with $0.41 per share a year ago. This increase was supported by solid results from our newly acquired Rhode Island business, as well as lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild winter weather and higher interest expense. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. Joe will speak to this more in his detailed review of our financial results. In addition to solid financial performance, we continue to execute on our commitment to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service to our more than 3.5 million customers. This includes managing several significant storms at our utilities, including a severe March wind storm in Kentucky, the third most significant weather event in the last 20 years in our service territory. Our teams, with the help of mutual assistance from several of our peers, restored power to more than 400,000 LG&E and KU customers. I thank each one of our men and women, as well as all those that provided mutual assistance for their dedication, commitment to safety, and demonstrated operational excellence. From a financial perspective, we received approval to treat nearly $20 million of Q1 O&M costs related to this extraordinary event as a regulatory asset. These types of events emphasize the importance of the investments we are making across our company to harden and improve the resiliency of our networks.  As the frequency of these events continues to increase, it becomes even more critical to ensure we are taking proactive steps to prepare our distribution and transmission networks. And we look forward to delivering on that goal in the most affordable way possible for our customers. We've also made significant progress during the first quarter in several areas that will improve our operating efficiency, deliver our clean energy strategy and improve service to our customers.  First, we continue to execute our plan in transitioning Rhode Island Energy to PPL Systems and remain on track to exit the remaining transition services with National Grid in 2024. We also advanced several key regulatory proceedings, which I'll discuss further on the next couple of slides.  Further, we successfully executed more than $3 billion of financings in the first quarter, reducing our interest rate exposure and strengthening our ability to achieve our top-tier earnings growth targets. And finally, our execution of approximately $600 million in capital investments during the first quarter keeps us on track to invest nearly $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments this year.  These investments benefit both customers and share owners as we continue to advance our strategy to create the utilities of the future. As a result, today, we are reaffirming our plans to invest nearly $12 billion in infrastructure improvements through 2026, to modernize our electric and gas networks and replace retiring generation in Kentucky.  Looking forward, we remain confident in the low-risk business plan we outlined in January and reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates, 6% to 8% through at least 2026.  Turning to Slide 5, we were pleased to secure a positive outcome in our first infrastructure, safety and reliability proceedings before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. ISR plans are submitted annually in Rhode Island and outline proposed capital investments and related operating costs to strengthen safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas distribution networks.  The approved plans address Rhode Island Energy's proposed spending from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. In its decision, the Public Utilities Commission approved $290 million of the approximately $350 million Rhode Island Energy proposed in its ISR filing. This allowed investments on the electric side that were largely tied to grid modernization and associated improvements.  On the gas side, most of the disallowed investment related to roughly 10 miles of leak-prone pipe replacement. While we believe the disallowed investments are the right projects to better serve our customers, we understand the Commission's desire to complete reviews of our grid modernization and advanced meter filings and to make further progress in the future of gas stakeholder proceedings before approving additional spending in those areas.  The investments not approved in this year's ISR plans may be recoverable in future proceedings subject to regulatory approval. This could be through future ISR filings, new base rate cases, and/or re-opener provisions within the base rate cases that we are currently operating under, particularly related to the grid modernization and AMF projects. Ultimately, we look forward to continued engagement on these matters with the Commission, the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and other stakeholders in Rhode Island. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to progress our Generation Investment Plan in Kentucky and remain confident that this plan is the best path forward for our customers as we plan for the state's energy future. Our plan is more affordable, maintains reliability and represents significantly cleaner energy resources for our customers than continuing to operate the coal units that we have proposed to retire by 2028. In fact, we estimate that our plan provides nearly $600 million of net present value benefits for our customers compared to continuing to operate these coal units. As we shared in March when Senate Bill 4 became law, we're confident that the generation replacement plan we filed in December exceeds the standards set by the new law, and as a result, we have not changed our CPCN strategy. As proposed, our plan would replace 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation, with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation, and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, our plan proposes the implementation of more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs by 2028. Altogether, the plan represents a $2.1 billion investment in Kentucky's energy future and the lease cost option to reliably meet the needs of our Kentucky customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. As an added benefit, our proposed plan would cut our carbon emissions nearly 25% from current levels while further diversifying our generation fleet. To comply with the new law, we expect to file our retirement request with the KPSC by May 10. Given the law provides the KPSC 180 days to issue a decision on retirement requests, this timing essentially aligns the retirement ruling with the expected decision on our CPCN filing. The decision on our filings is expected by November 6. Again, we're confident the plan we proposed offers the best path forward for the customers and communities we serve. We don't see any signs of federal environmental mandates easing over time, and we believe investing hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental control, continue operating aging, uneconomic coal plants is not in our customers' best interest. However, should we be required to make such investments? We do have the Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism or ECR in place. That would enable recovery of these investments outside of base rate cases. We\u2019ll continue to actively engage with stakeholders in Kentucky throughout the CPCN process to demonstrate how our plans best meet the needs of our customers. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. PPL's first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.39 per share. We recorded special items of $0.09 per share in the first quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.48 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share compared to Q1, 2022. The addition of Rhode Island Energy to our portfolio and our focus on O&M savings were the primary drivers of the increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes of about $0.05 per share due to the unusually mild winter weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and higher interest expense. Overall, our teams performed very well in the face of significant storms, and results for the quarter were in line with expectations apart from the weather.  Heating Degree days were down nearly 25% in our Kentucky service territory and 30% in our Pennsylvania territory. This resulted in lower quarterly sales volumes of nearly 9% in Kentucky and 7% in Pennsylvania.  We remain confident in delivering our 2023 earnings forecast, as we have several potential offsets to the mild weather, including the benefit of our recent financings at attractive rates compared to our plan, incremental disk revenues in Pennsylvania, outperformance on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, and effective O&M cost management. While we're not relying on weather, a warmer than normal summer could also provide some potential upside. We have an excellent track record of achieving our targets, which we expect to continue in 2023.  Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated Segment results were flat year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by increased transmission revenue and distribution rider recovery, offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather and higher interest expense, due to increased borrowings and higher rates. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.04 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather and higher interest expenses from increased borrowings, partially offset by lower O&M expenses. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.10 per share for the quarter. Rhode Island's Q1 results reflect the seasonal nature of gas operations during the winter months as a significant amount of Annual Natural Gas demand and earnings occur within the heating season. Finally, results at corporate and other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expenses and other factors that were not individually significant, partially offset by higher interest expense due to increased debt and higher rates.  Moving to Slide 10. During the quarter we successfully navigated a volatile rate market and completed our financing plan for 2023. This included five separate transactions, issuing a combined total of $3.2 billion of debt, including $1 billion convertible offering that was the first executed in our industry in 20 years.  Our first mover advantage on the convert led to strong demand from investors as our deal ended up pricing about 250 basis points lower than straight debt, resulting in roughly $25 million in annual interest expense savings. Given these savings, this transaction is favorable to issuing straight debt and any potential share dilution as a result of significant share price appreciation will be manageable.  We also executed several operating company issuances in Pennsylvania and Kentucky for combined proceeds of nearly $2.2 billion. A portion of the proceeds were used to reduce both short-term and floating rate debt, while the remaining will be used primarily to fund each utility's respective CapEx plans. In total, we repaid $1.75 billion of floating rate debt, reducing our floating rate exposure to approximately $600 million, which is less than 5% of our total debt portfolio. In summary, our strong execution of the financing plan this quarter reflects PPL's excellent credit position and we continue to target strong credit metrics and maintain one of the sector's best credit profiles without any planned equity issuances through our planning horizon.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi : Thank you, Joe. In closing, we remain solidly on track to deliver the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast, and we remain well positioned to deliver top tier earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually through at least 2026. We're off to a strong start in 2023, executing on our $2.4 billion capital plan, continuing the integration of Rhode Island Energy, advancing our plans in Kentucky and Rhode Island to deliver lease cost reliable energy for our customers and remaining on track with our first leg of achieving at least $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. As we pursue our strategy to create the utilities of the future, we are as strong as we've been in years and I'm convinced we're only getting stronger.  With that operator, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team, good morning. Thanks for giving me time. \nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Durgesh. \nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Vince. A lot of investor discussion went around just the legislation in Kentucky. Can you just share some initial feedback if you have any from your filings? A lot of investors are looking at this legislation thinking about what the, what it may mean for you and whether the state is actually going to accept your application to retire these coal plans, so just any additional color that you can share that would be appreciated.\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, sure. So look, in general, these are open proceedings. So we are going through the formal processes with the Commission. So not a lot to share directly in terms of feedback from the Commission. But as we think strategically Durgesh, the CPCN that we filed with the Commission is again \u2013our view is a lease cost option to serve our customers. Again as I mentioned in my remarks, we quantify the NPV savings to our customers at about $600 million versus continuing to operate the coal plants that we're proposing to retire.  Our plan also ensures reliability. It checks all of the issues that the SB4 has in it, in terms of cost and reliability, et cetera. So we think we meet the requirements that have come out in the new law. So from our perspective, we still feel very confident that we can get our plans approved through the Commission, engaging with our customers and the various interveners and stakeholders in the process. So overall, nothing changing from our perspective in terms of the CPCN strategy.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it, that's helpful, Vince. Is there a middle road here perhaps and I know this is early innings, but like not your plan in entirety, but a portion of your plan might get accepted and you have alternatives for the balance of the plan. I'm just thinking about the risks, because it's a significant portion of your CapEx, which is included in your plan as you go into the CPCN filings, and whether there's a sort of a collaborative approach here to get some of it, if not all of it approved.\nVince Sorgi: Yeah look, I think that's a fair question, Durgesh. We'll ultimately have to see when we go through the process with our interveners if there's a settlement scenario or case that we ultimately can agree to, to your point. Of course, we're always open to those types of discussions.  I think it's important to comment that if we do need to continue to operate the aging on economic coal plants that we're proposing to retire, that would require us to invest potentially significant amounts of capital to comply with existing EPA regulations, which again we don't think would be in the best interest of our customers. But if we're required to do that, we would have to make those capital investments. If you look at all of the plants that we're talking about retiring, again, we'd have to evaluate the final EPA regs once they come out in final form and then analyze all that. But sitting here today, that could be between $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion of environmental investments alone, not to mention the maintenance capital that we would have to incur to keep those plants operating. So quite a significant amount, potentially of investment that would be required there. And as I discussed, again in my remarks, that would recover \u2013 be recovered through the ECR mechanism, which basically provides real-time recovery for our share owners should we need to make those investments. We have other \u2013 if we're not going to spend $2.1 billion on gen replacement, I think from an affordability perspective we have other investments we can make in Kentucky, primarily in the T&D businesses. Again, we're seeing increased severity and frequency of storms in the state. We saw that just this quarter. So continuing to strengthen the grid in Kentucky, we certainly have the opportunity to do that as well. And then from a capital plan perspective, we really don't have a lot of the IIJA project funding in our plans. So specific to Kentucky, we have about $300 million worth of projects that we've submitted with the DOE. $150 million would be funded by us, and $150 million would be funded by the DOE. So at the end of the day, we're feeling really good about the overall capital plan Durgesh, and obviously feeding the earnings targets that we've laid out.\nDurgesh Chopra : That's great color, Vince. Thank you so much.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nVince Sorgi: Hi David.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey, guys, thanks so much for taking my questions. Let's see, I'm wondering if you could just maybe give an update on your confidence level in achieving your previously planned cost cuts for this year, what you're seeing for inflationary pressures. And I guess how hard of a stretch is it to dig deeper and also offset the weather headwinds that you're facing?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, sure. So I'll ask Joe maybe to comment on that.\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah sure, hey Dave. Well, first of all for the O&M targets that we've set for this year, we are on track to achieve those, and we feel really good about our ability to do so. As far as offsets for this year and the weather impact that we saw in the first quarter, I hit a number of them during my prepared remarks, but those include the benefits from the strong execution of the convert that we issued earlier this year, and that's about $0.01 to $0.02 better than our expectations.  We're also anticipating that this mechanism in Pennsylvania provides additional earnings. It could be about another $0.01 to $0.02 there, and then any potential outperformance on the integration of Rhode Island Energy, and we're very focused on that integration process there and always trying to do better than our plan, and that could be another $0.001, maybe $0.02. And then, so if you're looking beyond that, we always have the ability to flex our O&M spending, which we could do on top of that.\nVince Sorgi: There are a number of levers we have at our disposal, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah, great. Yeah, you anticipated my other question, which was to get a little more clarity on those other levers, so that's really helpful. And then, I was just wondering if you could touch on Rhode Island and just following the ISR decision. Maybe one, do you think there's still interest in pursuing those projects by the Commission that didn't get approval? And then just wondering maybe more holistically, are there other opportunities that you would look for additional CapEx upside in Rhode Island more broadly?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, sure. So first of all, I'd say I think the process in Rhode Island was very constructive. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, the projects that did not get approved were really associated with other proceedings that are currently in front of the Commission. In particular, the grid modernization on the electric side and the leak-prone pipe on the gas side. So because we have other proceedings in front of the Commission on those areas, it wasn't a total surprise to me that they decided to temper some of the increase in those areas pending, getting a little further down the road on those proceedings. We will have the opportunity, to your question, to request those projects in future proceedings. Again, those could be future ISR proceedings. They could be future base rate cases, depending on the timing of when we file our next base rate case. We also have reopened our provisions in the current rate case for both grid mod and the AMF filing, so we could also potentially use that avenue as well. But I think it's important to point out that the $290 million, almost $300 million of investments that we did get approval for, right, those are vital in strengthening the safety, reliability and resiliency of our networks. And so I think it highlights the importance of the ISR mechanism for our customers, but it also demonstrates the constructive regulatory framework for our investors. In terms of additional capital opportunities, I think probably the biggest one would be again, in the IIJA buckets. We have about $480 million worth of projects that we've applied for with the DOE. $330 million of that would be PPL funded, $150 million of that would be DOE funded. Obviously that helps the economics on those projects. So we could again, funnel those through the ISR or other mechanisms to get approval. We would need regulatory approval for those projects. But again, with the DOE kicking in, about 30% funding on those, it really helps the cost-benefit analysis on those projects. So hopefully we would get a lot of support in the state to do those types of projects.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Excellent! I appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoe Bergstein: Hey, Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo : Hi! Good morning. Thank you, team. And thank you for the call on Kentucky in particular. Just if I add up the pieces that you mentioned, is it fair to say that in a worst-case scenario you could offset the majority of that 2.1 generation plan with other spending if you needed to?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah Paul, we're very confident in being able to meet our earnings targets and trajectory. I think how we get there under different scenarios of a CPCN approval process, we have to look at that depending on what exactly gets approved.  So like I was saying, if some of that capital ends up being environmental spend on coal plants where we earn, cash recovery on that spend pretty much as we're spending it, where as we know our base plan is assuming under the $2.1 billion we'll be spending under the CPCN, $1.6 billion in our time period, that requires a base rate case for cash funding. So we\u2019ll get \u2013 we would get some potential upside on the earnings profile by recovering quicker. Again, we have to see how much the impact on the overall capital plan is if any, coming out of the CPCN. But really, we feel confident in our ability to hit our targets under various scenarios coming out of the CPCN funding. So it's a little tough to just say, this capital bucket for that capital bucket, because you also have the positive effect of the ECR mechanism in there.\nPaul Zimbardo : Okay, thank you. That's good context as well, I appreciate it. And then switching topics, Joe mentioned that the outperformance of the Rhode Island integration could be a penny or two favorable for 2023. Should we think of that as more of a timing element or if you're successful there, would that accrue to 2024 plus? Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Yeah Joe, do you want to?\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah, no. I think it's more on just our overall performance against our expectations there and being able to integrate at a lower cost than we expect. The TSA period goes through 2024. So my comments were really focused on \u201823 and our ability to offset the negative weather start to the year.\nPaul Zimbardo : Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nJoe Bergstein: Sure.\nOperator: The next question will come from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So first maybe something completely different. So we're probably halfway through the earnings season and we haven't yet heard from any utility about some additional O&M efficiencies associated with reduced office space. Is that even something that you guys are considering? I mean it seems like this hybrid work model has persisted even in your industry and I just wonder if that's, it's a lever that you might pull in the future from an O&M perspective or it's not something that you're currently considering?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah Angie, I think that's a great question, great point. So I think generally why you haven't probably heard a lot about it is either utilities own their buildings, their office buildings that they are operating out of or they have leases that they are, fixed leases that they are currently paying under, and so maybe not an immediate source of operating efficiency or O&M savings.  But clearly in the post-pandemic world, and as we think about hybrid or remote working versus in the office working, I think it's an area that you will see most of corporate America focusing on over the years to come. So I think specifically to answer your question, we're not necessarily seeing it right away or even in the next year or so. But certainly I think that could be an opportunity longer term as we right size our real estate needs for sure.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just taking it one step further, are you seeing any sort of a slowdown among commercial customers, again, somehow linked to office buildings and downsizing or any other signs of economic slowdown, like any leading indicators that you see among your customers, not only on the commercial side, but also industrial?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah Joe, do you want to talk about maybe just load in general?\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah, sure. Hey Angie, it's Joe. We are \u2013 we continue to see a number of positive economic factors in both of our jurisdictions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued low unemployment rates and strong GDP growth.  And in Kentucky, as we've talked about a number of times, we saw back-to-back record years of economic development with over $10 billion of announced investments in each of 2021 and 2022. That includes the 4DV battery plant initiative that we've talked about a number of times. That's recently broken ground and well under construction. And we continue to see strong industrial growth, primarily in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. So we have not seen that in our territories, and Rhode Island's decoupled and less reliant on those things.\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, I think just in general you're seeing people catch up from the lull in COVID, right, whether that was supply chain driven or just the lull in the economy during COVID and kind of the bow wave to not only catch up to pre-COVID levels, but then the growth. We're seeing some of our major industrials not only getting back to pre-COVID, but talking also about expansion, expanding their footprints and their production facilities. So in our jurisdictions, generally I think we're feeling really good about our local economies and where the growth that we're seeing in our areas.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just one last follow-up on Kentucky. And again, I should know that, so I mean the purpose of the bill was to basically continue the usage of the coal that is mined in Kentucky or is it continued operations of the coal plants? I mean it might be a subtle difference, but how about just running these coal plants on gas and that's checking that box of continued operations of these plants while sourcing energy from those new gas plants, which given the gas price environment just became even more beneficial to the end user?\nVince Sorgi: Well, look I don't want to comment on the purpose of the bill. I think we'd have to probably hear that from the folks that wrote the bill. But in general, I would say coming out of the winter storm, Elliott, there was a general concern on just ensuring that reliability is kind of at the forefront of generation decisions in the state. There was concern that the clean energy transition is happening too quickly and making sure that reliability again is front and center. I will say that has always been an area that we and our commission have focused incredibly on as we put together our generation planning, our CPCN filings, what the form of generation replacement looks like, etc. It's why we have two combined cycle units in our CPCN, and it's not 100% renewables. We were absolutely as focused on reliability as I think the legislature is in the state to ensure that we can deliver that power 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And so I think we were already operating under the reliability issues that were addressed in the bill, in terms of driving either coal mining or running coal plants. I can't necessarily speak to that per se. However, I would say we will continue to put forth plans that ensure reliability, but do that in the least cost manner for our customers, which the bill also has in it as well. And again, we think our CPCN plan absolutely balances all of those in the most productive way for our customers.\nAngie Storozynski: Great. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson : Hey! Good morning, guys.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Patterson : With respect to the Rhode Island gas modernization program, I guess what sort of comes to mind when looking at that case is, again, sort of telling myself. How do you think about the potential for strained investment with electrification efforts in places like Rhode Island and what have you? I know it's different in different jurisdictions, but I'm just sort of wondering, sort of broad picture when you're thinking about this, how does the idea of electrification or these sort of really aggressive carbon greenhouse gas reduction efforts. How do you think about that with respect to your gas CapEx plans and what have you?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, I think there's a number of factors that go into that, Paul. One is the cost of electrification. The second is the reliability of supplying electricity if the bulk of the economy is or the vast majority of the economy becomes electrified and then ultimately, the benefits of fuel diversity by having natural gas in addition to electricity. Obviously the state has targets to be economy-wide net zero by 2050. On the electricity side, net basically 100% renewable driven by 2033. Our investment plans on the T&D networks are geared towards that 2033, 100% renewable date.  We are actively engaged with numerous stakeholders in Rhode Island, including the PUC on the future of gas docket. And so we are actively engaged with doing analysis on various scenarios on how we could see the future of the Rhode Island Energy sector feeding the economy there and how the natural gas system will ultimately be used or not. We would expect to have our initial view of that and issue a report to the PUC late fall of this year. In the spring of next year, the PUC would then target issuing its report to the government agency that's in charge of implementing the Act on climate rules within the state and then we would expect that organization, EC4, to issue their report in 2025. So, a great question. There's a lot of work and actually a formal docket within the commission to exactly answer that question. And I think you could see various possibilities there, right, whether or not we're blending different molecules through the pipes, maybe it's not all natural gas, we're using more renewable natural gas, we're using hydrogen in combination of those things. So really, we're right in the middle of it right now Paul, and more to come as I think we make progress on that analysis and ultimately those reports coming out of those various agencies.\nPaul Patterson : Okay, awesome. And then you obviously have a reliability initiative in Kentucky and what have you. And obviously things are a little bit more limited in places like Pennsylvania and Rhode Island just given to the structure there. But as you know there's some alarm bells ringing off or have been ringing off for some time in PJM regarding reliability.  We're seeing some stuff in New Hampshire with respect to long-term PPAs potentially and what have you. And I'm just wondering, is there any potential on the electric side that you guys are thinking about here, either in terms of longer-term PPAs maybe in terms of the reliability side batteries, virtual power plants, I don't know or just own generation or what have you.  In terms of addressing these issues as opposed to maybe the way the construct has been, which is sort of like relying on PJM, the RPM model or capacity markets or what have you, that maybe it's time to sort of pivot at least a little bit and look at terms of maybe other structures than yet another sort of capacity market remake, if you follow what I'm saying. Or I don't know, I'm just thinking about, we're just hearing a lot of [audio gap] right now Senate hearing with FERC. I'm just sort of \u2013 I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that.\nVince Sorgi: I would say yes to all of that. This is an area that I spend a lot of time thinking about and we're starting to formulate our strategy along the lines of many of the things that you just mentioned. So to your point, PJM themselves I think are very concerned about 40 to 45 gigawatts of thermal generation announced to be retired between now and 2030. That's an incredible amount of very reliable, dispatchable generation that is scheduled to come out of the ISO, out of the gen stack. The vast majority, almost all of the replacement generation are intermittent renewables and developers are having a hard time getting the siting and permitting or getting any of it built. So even if it does get built, which there's a lot of, I think concern in terms of the timing of when this replacement generation gets built, you're replacing very reliable, dispatchable energy with intermittent energy. And so I do think PJM is concerned as they're looking at their generation stack and thinking about the ISO itself, which of course then makes me focus on how do we ensure we have electrons flowing through our wires in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. So yeah, we are absolutely focused on this, laser focused on this I would say. And some of the things that you had mentioned, I would say all of those I think are areas that we think we can take a look at to try to shore up the gen supply in our own jurisdictions. Great question.\nPaul Patterson : Just a quick follow-up on that. Do you think the people in the legislature or whatever, the lawmakers, whatever the officials in those states are open to those ideas as well? Because I would assume it might have to take changes on the part of the regimes in those states. Do you follow what I'm saying? I mean, are they open to this do you think, or do they recognize it or...\nVince Sorgi: I think it's new. This is a new topic for them. We will be engaging with not only our legislators, but our regulators, just to make sure that we're all on the same page as we look at security of energy going forward. But we have flexibility within the current rules to do a lot of what you suggested. So, not all of this requires legislative change and so we'll certainly use as much of the levers within current legislation and regulation to shore up gen supply. But to your point, if we need to go beyond that, that might require legislative change. I can't handicap today the likelihood of that.\nPaul Patterson : Okay. I got you. Awesome. Thanks so much, guys.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ross Fowler with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRoss Fowler: Good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Ross.\nRoss Fowler: Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but maybe let me ask this one. And apologies if I drag out the past here, but can you sort of give us the context or at least the contention in this fraudulent conveyance claim against PPL Hydro that's out there with Talen, and sort of if there's any process here or timeline around actually resolving that?\nVince Sorgi: Sure. So the case itself relates to when we still owned PPL Montana, when PPL still owned PPL Montana, we had sold the hydro assets to Northwestern and the proceeds of those assets, $700 million that we distributed those proceeds back to PPL following the sale. That was known and negotiated when we created Talen Energy as part of spinning out energy supply and merging that with Riverstone\u2019s assets and so all of that was well understood, well documented.  The contention is that we somehow by doing that, we made PPL Montana insolvent and so that is the fraudulent conveyance charge. We feel extremely confident in our position in defense that PPL Montana was not only in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the distributions were made, but that it was also solvent at all relevant times as it relates to the law and those distributions. So, just in terms of an update on the situation with the case, we did go into mediation between the parties recently. We could not come to agreement in that mediation, and so we have discontinued that and so we're basically back in the bankruptcy court. We would expect to resolve this with the court proceeding hopefully by the end of the year, Ross. So Talen has indicated certain timeframes on coming out of bankruptcy within the next couple months. This issue will not and does not necessarily need to be resolved before they can do that, but we do expect it will be resolved by the end of the year.\nRoss Fowler: Yeah, that's a fantastic update, Vince. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Sure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nVince Sorgi: Well, thanks again for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with investors at our Annual Shareholders Meeting in a couple of weeks or perhaps we'll see you on the road here soon. So, thanks again for joining us, and we'll close out.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter Investor Update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4.  Today, we announced first quarter reported earnings of $0.39 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.48 per share compared with $0.41 per share a year ago. This increase was supported by solid results from our newly acquired Rhode Island business, as well as lower O&M expenses, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild winter weather and higher interest expense. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2023 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.65 per share with a midpoint of $1.58 per share. Joe will speak to this more in his detailed review of our financial results. In addition to solid financial performance, we continue to execute on our commitment to provide safe and reliable electric and gas service to our more than 3.5 million customers. This includes managing several significant storms at our utilities, including a severe March wind storm in Kentucky, the third most significant weather event in the last 20 years in our service territory. Our teams, with the help of mutual assistance from several of our peers, restored power to more than 400,000 LG&E and KU customers. I thank each one of our men and women, as well as all those that provided mutual assistance for their dedication, commitment to safety, and demonstrated operational excellence. From a financial perspective, we received approval to treat nearly $20 million of Q1 O&M costs related to this extraordinary event as a regulatory asset. These types of events emphasize the importance of the investments we are making across our company to harden and improve the resiliency of our networks.  As the frequency of these events continues to increase, it becomes even more critical to ensure we are taking proactive steps to prepare our distribution and transmission networks. And we look forward to delivering on that goal in the most affordable way possible for our customers. We've also made significant progress during the first quarter in several areas that will improve our operating efficiency, deliver our clean energy strategy and improve service to our customers.  First, we continue to execute our plan in transitioning Rhode Island Energy to PPL Systems and remain on track to exit the remaining transition services with National Grid in 2024. We also advanced several key regulatory proceedings, which I'll discuss further on the next couple of slides.  Further, we successfully executed more than $3 billion of financings in the first quarter, reducing our interest rate exposure and strengthening our ability to achieve our top-tier earnings growth targets. And finally, our execution of approximately $600 million in capital investments during the first quarter keeps us on track to invest nearly $2.5 billion in infrastructure investments this year.  These investments benefit both customers and share owners as we continue to advance our strategy to create the utilities of the future. As a result, today, we are reaffirming our plans to invest nearly $12 billion in infrastructure improvements through 2026, to modernize our electric and gas networks and replace retiring generation in Kentucky.  Looking forward, we remain confident in the low-risk business plan we outlined in January and reaffirmed our projected compound annual earnings per share and dividend growth rates, 6% to 8% through at least 2026.  Turning to Slide 5, we were pleased to secure a positive outcome in our first infrastructure, safety and reliability proceedings before the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. ISR plans are submitted annually in Rhode Island and outline proposed capital investments and related operating costs to strengthen safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas distribution networks.  The approved plans address Rhode Island Energy's proposed spending from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. In its decision, the Public Utilities Commission approved $290 million of the approximately $350 million Rhode Island Energy proposed in its ISR filing. This allowed investments on the electric side that were largely tied to grid modernization and associated improvements.  On the gas side, most of the disallowed investment related to roughly 10 miles of leak-prone pipe replacement. While we believe the disallowed investments are the right projects to better serve our customers, we understand the Commission's desire to complete reviews of our grid modernization and advanced meter filings and to make further progress in the future of gas stakeholder proceedings before approving additional spending in those areas.  The investments not approved in this year's ISR plans may be recoverable in future proceedings subject to regulatory approval. This could be through future ISR filings, new base rate cases, and/or re-opener provisions within the base rate cases that we are currently operating under, particularly related to the grid modernization and AMF projects. Ultimately, we look forward to continued engagement on these matters with the Commission, the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and other stakeholders in Rhode Island. Turning to Slide 6, we continue to progress our Generation Investment Plan in Kentucky and remain confident that this plan is the best path forward for our customers as we plan for the state's energy future. Our plan is more affordable, maintains reliability and represents significantly cleaner energy resources for our customers than continuing to operate the coal units that we have proposed to retire by 2028. In fact, we estimate that our plan provides nearly $600 million of net present value benefits for our customers compared to continuing to operate these coal units. As we shared in March when Senate Bill 4 became law, we're confident that the generation replacement plan we filed in December exceeds the standards set by the new law, and as a result, we have not changed our CPCN strategy. As proposed, our plan would replace 1,500 megawatts of aging coal generation, with over 1,200 megawatts of new combined cycle natural gas generation, nearly 1,000 megawatts of solar generation, and 125 megawatts of battery storage. In addition, our plan proposes the implementation of more than a dozen new energy efficiency programs by 2028. Altogether, the plan represents a $2.1 billion investment in Kentucky's energy future and the lease cost option to reliably meet the needs of our Kentucky customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. As an added benefit, our proposed plan would cut our carbon emissions nearly 25% from current levels while further diversifying our generation fleet. To comply with the new law, we expect to file our retirement request with the KPSC by May 10. Given the law provides the KPSC 180 days to issue a decision on retirement requests, this timing essentially aligns the retirement ruling with the expected decision on our CPCN filing. The decision on our filings is expected by November 6. Again, we're confident the plan we proposed offers the best path forward for the customers and communities we serve. We don't see any signs of federal environmental mandates easing over time, and we believe investing hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental control, continue operating aging, uneconomic coal plants is not in our customers' best interest. However, should we be required to make such investments? We do have the Environmental Cost Recovery Mechanism or ECR in place. That would enable recovery of these investments outside of base rate cases. We'll continue to actively engage with stakeholders in Kentucky throughout the CPCN process to demonstrate how our plans best meet the needs of our customers. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, we remain solidly on track to deliver the midpoint of our 2023 earnings forecast, and we remain well positioned to deliver top tier earnings and dividend growth of 6% to 8% annually through at least 2026. We're off to a strong start in 2023, executing on our $2.4 billion capital plan, continuing the integration of Rhode Island Energy, advancing our plans in Kentucky and Rhode Island to deliver lease cost reliable energy for our customers and remaining on track with our first leg of achieving at least $175 million in O&M savings by 2026. As we pursue our strategy to create the utilities of the future, we are as strong as we've been in years and I'm convinced we're only getting stronger.  With that operator, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Durgesh. Yeah, sure. So look, in general, these are open proceedings. So we are going through the formal processes with the Commission. So not a lot to share directly in terms of feedback from the Commission. But as we think strategically Durgesh, the CPCN that we filed with the Commission is again \u2013our view is a lease cost option to serve our customers. Again as I mentioned in my remarks, we quantify the NPV savings to our customers at about $600 million versus continuing to operate the coal plants that we're proposing to retire.  Our plan also ensures reliability. It checks all of the issues that the SB4 has in it, in terms of cost and reliability, et cetera. So we think we meet the requirements that have come out in the new law. So from our perspective, we still feel very confident that we can get our plans approved through the Commission, engaging with our customers and the various interveners and stakeholders in the process. So overall, nothing changing from our perspective in terms of the CPCN strategy. Yeah look, I think that's a fair question, Durgesh. We'll ultimately have to see when we go through the process with our interveners if there's a settlement scenario or case that we ultimately can agree to, to your point. Of course, we're always open to those types of discussions.  I think it's important to comment that if we do need to continue to operate the aging on economic coal plants that we're proposing to retire, that would require us to invest potentially significant amounts of capital to comply with existing EPA regulations, which again we don't think would be in the best interest of our customers. But if we're required to do that, we would have to make those capital investments. If you look at all of the plants that we're talking about retiring, again, we'd have to evaluate the final EPA regs once they come out in final form and then analyze all that. But sitting here today, that could be between $0.5 billion and $1.5 billion of environmental investments alone, not to mention the maintenance capital that we would have to incur to keep those plants operating. So quite a significant amount, potentially of investment that would be required there. And as I discussed, again in my remarks, that would recover \u2013 be recovered through the ECR mechanism, which basically provides real-time recovery for our share owners should we need to make those investments. We have other \u2013 if we're not going to spend $2.1 billion on gen replacement, I think from an affordability perspective we have other investments we can make in Kentucky, primarily in the T&D businesses. Again, we're seeing increased severity and frequency of storms in the state. We saw that just this quarter. So continuing to strengthen the grid in Kentucky, we certainly have the opportunity to do that as well. And then from a capital plan perspective, we really don't have a lot of the IIJA project funding in our plans. So specific to Kentucky, we have about $300 million worth of projects that we've submitted with the DOE. $150 million would be funded by us, and $150 million would be funded by the DOE. So at the end of the day, we're feeling really good about the overall capital plan Durgesh, and obviously feeding the earnings targets that we've laid out. Sure. Hi David. Yeah, sure. So I'll ask Joe maybe to comment on that. There are a number of levers we have at our disposal, David. Yeah, sure. So first of all, I'd say I think the process in Rhode Island was very constructive. And as I talked about in my prepared remarks, the projects that did not get approved were really associated with other proceedings that are currently in front of the Commission. In particular, the grid modernization on the electric side and the leak-prone pipe on the gas side. So because we have other proceedings in front of the Commission on those areas, it wasn't a total surprise to me that they decided to temper some of the increase in those areas pending, getting a little further down the road on those proceedings. We will have the opportunity, to your question, to request those projects in future proceedings. Again, those could be future ISR proceedings. They could be future base rate cases, depending on the timing of when we file our next base rate case. We also have reopened our provisions in the current rate case for both grid mod and the AMF filing, so we could also potentially use that avenue as well. But I think it's important to point out that the $290 million, almost $300 million of investments that we did get approval for, right, those are vital in strengthening the safety, reliability and resiliency of our networks. And so I think it highlights the importance of the ISR mechanism for our customers, but it also demonstrates the constructive regulatory framework for our investors. In terms of additional capital opportunities, I think probably the biggest one would be again, in the IIJA buckets. We have about $480 million worth of projects that we've applied for with the DOE. $330 million of that would be PPL funded, $150 million of that would be DOE funded. Obviously that helps the economics on those projects. So we could again, funnel those through the ISR or other mechanisms to get approval. We would need regulatory approval for those projects. But again, with the DOE kicking in, about 30% funding on those, it really helps the cost-benefit analysis on those projects. So hopefully we would get a lot of support in the state to do those types of projects. Sure. Yeah Paul, we're very confident in being able to meet our earnings targets and trajectory. I think how we get there under different scenarios of a CPCN approval process, we have to look at that depending on what exactly gets approved.  So like I was saying, if some of that capital ends up being environmental spend on coal plants where we earn, cash recovery on that spend pretty much as we're spending it, where as we know our base plan is assuming under the $2.1 billion we'll be spending under the CPCN, $1.6 billion in our time period, that requires a base rate case for cash funding. So we'll get \u2013 we would get some potential upside on the earnings profile by recovering quicker. Again, we have to see how much the impact on the overall capital plan is if any, coming out of the CPCN. But really, we feel confident in our ability to hit our targets under various scenarios coming out of the CPCN funding. So it's a little tough to just say, this capital bucket for that capital bucket, because you also have the positive effect of the ECR mechanism in there. Yeah Joe, do you want to? Yeah Angie, I think that's a great question, great point. So I think generally why you haven't probably heard a lot about it is either utilities own their buildings, their office buildings that they are operating out of or they have leases that they are, fixed leases that they are currently paying under, and so maybe not an immediate source of operating efficiency or O&M savings.  But clearly in the post-pandemic world, and as we think about hybrid or remote working versus in the office working, I think it's an area that you will see most of corporate America focusing on over the years to come. So I think specifically to answer your question, we're not necessarily seeing it right away or even in the next year or so. But certainly I think that could be an opportunity longer term as we right size our real estate needs for sure. Yeah Joe, do you want to talk about maybe just load in general? Yeah, I think just in general you're seeing people catch up from the lull in COVID, right, whether that was supply chain driven or just the lull in the economy during COVID and kind of the bow wave to not only catch up to pre-COVID levels, but then the growth. We're seeing some of our major industrials not only getting back to pre-COVID, but talking also about expansion, expanding their footprints and their production facilities. So in our jurisdictions, generally I think we're feeling really good about our local economies and where the growth that we're seeing in our areas. Well, look I don't want to comment on the purpose of the bill. I think we'd have to probably hear that from the folks that wrote the bill. But in general, I would say coming out of the winter storm, Elliott, there was a general concern on just ensuring that reliability is kind of at the forefront of generation decisions in the state. There was concern that the clean energy transition is happening too quickly and making sure that reliability again is front and center. I will say that has always been an area that we and our commission have focused incredibly on as we put together our generation planning, our CPCN filings, what the form of generation replacement looks like, etc. It's why we have two combined cycle units in our CPCN, and it's not 100% renewables. We were absolutely as focused on reliability as I think the legislature is in the state to ensure that we can deliver that power 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And so I think we were already operating under the reliability issues that were addressed in the bill, in terms of driving either coal mining or running coal plants. I can't necessarily speak to that per se. However, I would say we will continue to put forth plans that ensure reliability, but do that in the least cost manner for our customers, which the bill also has in it as well. And again, we think our CPCN plan absolutely balances all of those in the most productive way for our customers. Thank you. Good morning, Paul. Yeah, I think there's a number of factors that go into that, Paul. One is the cost of electrification. The second is the reliability of supplying electricity if the bulk of the economy is or the vast majority of the economy becomes electrified and then ultimately, the benefits of fuel diversity by having natural gas in addition to electricity. Obviously the state has targets to be economy-wide net zero by 2050. On the electricity side, net basically 100% renewable driven by 2033. Our investment plans on the T&D networks are geared towards that 2033, 100% renewable date.  We are actively engaged with numerous stakeholders in Rhode Island, including the PUC on the future of gas docket. And so we are actively engaged with doing analysis on various scenarios on how we could see the future of the Rhode Island Energy sector feeding the economy there and how the natural gas system will ultimately be used or not. We would expect to have our initial view of that and issue a report to the PUC late fall of this year. In the spring of next year, the PUC would then target issuing its report to the government agency that's in charge of implementing the Act on climate rules within the state and then we would expect that organization, EC4, to issue their report in 2025. So, a great question. There's a lot of work and actually a formal docket within the commission to exactly answer that question. And I think you could see various possibilities there, right, whether or not we're blending different molecules through the pipes, maybe it's not all natural gas, we're using more renewable natural gas, we're using hydrogen in combination of those things. So really, we're right in the middle of it right now Paul, and more to come as I think we make progress on that analysis and ultimately those reports coming out of those various agencies.

And so I do think PJM is concerned as they're looking at their generation stack and thinking about the ISO itself, which of course then makes me focus on how do we ensure we have electrons flowing through our wires in Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. So yeah, we are absolutely focused on this, laser focused on this I would say.

            "content": "Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 8. PPL's first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.39 per share. We recorded special items of $0.09 per share in the first quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.48 per share, an improvement of $0.07 per share compared to Q1, 2022. The addition of Rhode Island Energy to our portfolio and our focus on O&M savings were the primary drivers of the increase, partially offset by lower sales volumes of about $0.05 per share due to the unusually mild winter weather in Kentucky and Pennsylvania and higher interest expense. Overall, our teams performed very well in the face of significant storms, and results for the quarter were in line with expectations apart from the weather.  Heating Degree days were down nearly 25% in our Kentucky service territory and 30% in our Pennsylvania territory. This resulted in lower quarterly sales volumes of nearly 9% in Kentucky and 7% in Pennsylvania.  We remain confident in delivering our 2023 earnings forecast, as we have several potential offsets to the mild weather, including the benefit of our recent financings at attractive rates compared to our plan, incremental disk revenues in Pennsylvania, outperformance on our integration of Rhode Island Energy, and effective O&M cost management. While we're not relying on weather, a warmer than normal summer could also provide some potential upside. We have an excellent track record of achieving our targets, which we expect to continue in 2023.  Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the quarter on Slide 9. Our Pennsylvania Regulated Segment results were flat year-over-year. Results were primarily driven by increased transmission revenue and distribution rider recovery, offset by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather and higher interest expense, due to increased borrowings and higher rates. Our Kentucky segment decreased by $0.04 per share year-over-year. Results were impacted primarily by lower sales volumes due to the mild weather and higher interest expenses from increased borrowings, partially offset by lower O&M expenses. The addition of our Rhode Island segment increased earnings by $0.10 per share for the quarter. Rhode Island's Q1 results reflect the seasonal nature of gas operations during the winter months as a significant amount of Annual Natural Gas demand and earnings occur within the heating season. Finally, results at corporate and other increased $0.01 per share compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower O&M expenses and other factors that were not individually significant, partially offset by higher interest expense due to increased debt and higher rates.  Moving to Slide 10. During the quarter we successfully navigated a volatile rate market and completed our financing plan for 2023. This included five separate transactions, issuing a combined total of $3.2 billion of debt, including $1 billion convertible offering that was the first executed in our industry in 20 years.  Our first mover advantage on the convert led to strong demand from investors as our deal ended up pricing about 250 basis points lower than straight debt, resulting in roughly $25 million in annual interest expense savings. Given these savings, this transaction is favorable to issuing straight debt and any potential share dilution as a result of significant share price appreciation will be manageable.  We also executed several operating company issuances in Pennsylvania and Kentucky for combined proceeds of nearly $2.2 billion. A portion of the proceeds were used to reduce both short-term and floating rate debt, while the remaining will be used primarily to fund each utility's respective CapEx plans. In total, we repaid $1.75 billion of floating rate debt, reducing our floating rate exposure to approximately $600 million, which is less than 5% of our total debt portfolio. In summary, our strong execution of the financing plan this quarter reflects PPL's excellent credit position and we continue to target strong credit metrics and maintain one of the sector's best credit profiles without any planned equity issuances through our planning horizon.  That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll turn the call back over to Vince. Yeah sure, hey Dave. Well, first of all for the O&M targets that we've set for this year, we are on track to achieve those, and we feel really good about our ability to do so. As far as offsets for this year and the weather impact that we saw in the first quarter, I hit a number of them during my prepared remarks, but those include the benefits from the strong execution of the convert that we issued earlier this year, and that's about $0.01 to $0.02 better than our expectations.  We're also anticipating that this mechanism in Pennsylvania provides additional earnings. It could be about another $0.01 to $0.02 there, and then any potential outperformance on the integration of Rhode Island Energy, and we're very focused on that integration process there and always trying to do better than our plan, and that could be another $0.001, maybe $0.02. And then, so if you're looking beyond that, we always have the ability to flex our O&M spending, which we could do on top of that. Hey, Paul. Yeah, no. I think it's more on just our overall performance against our expectations there and being able to integrate at a lower cost than we expect. The TSA period goes through 2024. So my comments were really focused on \u201823 and our ability to offset the negative weather start to the year. Sure. Yeah, sure. Hey Angie, it's Joe. We are \u2013 we continue to see a number of positive economic factors in both of our jurisdictions in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, including continued low unemployment rates and strong GDP growth.  And in Kentucky, as we've talked about a number of times, we saw back-to-back record years of economic development with over $10 billion of announced investments in each of 2021 and 2022. That includes the 4DV battery plant initiative that we've talked about a number of times. That's recently broken ground and well under construction. And we continue to see strong industrial growth, primarily in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors. So we have not seen that in our territories, and Rhode Island's decoupled and less reliant on those things."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call to Andy Ludwig, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on third quarter 2024 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we'll conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings on this call. Reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from our third quarter performance on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.42 per share. Given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we narrowed our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast to $1.67 to $1.73 per share from the prior forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. As a result, we've increased the midpoint of $0.01 to $1.70 per share. Throughout the third quarter, we continue to make excellent progress on delivering our 2024 priorities. We're on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and cleaner energy future for our customers. And through our ongoing business transformation initiatives, we're on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of $120 million to $130 million this year compared our 2021 baseline O&M. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth through at least 2027. We're focused on executing our capital plan, which includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027, with continued potential upside driven by data center connections in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, new generation in Kentucky, new enterprise-wide technology investments and additional resiliency investments across all of our jurisdictions as we combat more frequent and severe storms. And across PPL, we continue to drive efficiencies through our Utility of the Future strategy, keeping us on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026, which again is compared to our 2021 baseline. Moving to Slide 5. On October 18, LG&E and KU submitted their updated Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides a robust analysis of a wide range of variables, including demand growth, fuel prices, supply-side resource costs, and pending environmental regulations, all to guide our resource planning. This year's IRP examined 300 potential resource portfolio and fuel price combinations to arrive at a plan to most effectively meet forecasted demand over the next 15 years. It's important to note that the IRP is submitted for informational purposes only. That said, the detailed analysis provides reasonable insights about future generation needs and helps us to identify no regrets recommendations, given there is uncertainty with some of the inputs. Key drivers in our latest IRP analysis, includes stronger demand forecast and higher costs for new supply-side resources from what we saw in our last IRP, which was filed three years ago in 2021. In terms of demand, our mid-load scenario reflects load growth of nearly 1.5% annually through 2039. But more importantly, projects annual load growth of over 3% through 2032, which is significantly impacted by projected data center load. We evaluated several scenarios for data centers ranging from 0 to nearly 2 gigawatts of new load by 2032 with the mid-load scenario assuming just over 1 gigawatt. Based on the interest levels that LG&E and KU have already seen from developers, we view no or low data center growth as unlikely. Regarding the cost of new generation, we've seen those costs increase markedly since our 2021 IRP except for batteries. That increases the relative value of our existing generation resources and significantly impacted the generation mix recommended in this year's IRP. Regarding the battery costs, this is the first time in our ongoing resource planning that the sum of capital and non-fuel O&M costs for battery storage with tax incentives included is less than the cost of new simple-cycle combustion turbines. For this reason, our recommended plan includes the addition of 900 megawatts of battery storage. Importantly, due to the price increases in solar generation, we are not assuming the 637 megawatts of solar PPAs that were approved by the KPSC and our 2022 CPCN get built. As noted in our IRP, the impact of environmental regulations remains a key uncertainty as three major regulations are the subject of current federal court challenges. Our IRP modeled four different environmental regulation scenarios ranging from none to all of the regulations becoming enforceable. The updated IRP assumes all resources and retirements approved in our last CPCN proceeding are completed as planned by 2028, except for the solar PPAs that I just mentioned. This includes our approved plans to retire 600 megawatts of aging coal and 50 megawatts of aging peaking units by 2027. In addition, it includes building a new 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle unit, 240 megawatts of company-owned solar, and 125 megawatts of battery storage. Above and beyond this generation, the IRP lays out several resource plans, including two we've referenced on this slide, a recommended resource plan, as well as an enhanced solar applicable in certain scenarios. The recommended plan reflects our no-regrets approach to planning, much like our latest CPCN filing and includes important generation development even if scenarios that reflect high economic load growth or CO2 regulations do not come to fruition. This plant projects the need to build an additional 2,700 megawatts of new generation from 2028 through 2035 to safely, reliably and affordably serve future demand growth. This includes two new 650-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plants, one in 2030 and another one in 2031. It includes the addition of 400 megawatts of new battery storage in 2028 and 500 megawatts of additional battery storage in 2035. It also includes 500 megawatts of solar in 2035. The recommended plan also projects the need to add new environmental controls at the Gen and Trimble County coal plants to ensure compliance with ELG and NOx regulations. The enhanced solar plan meanwhile differs from the recommended plan only in the timing and level of new solar generation added, rather than adding 500 megawatts of solar in 2035, the enhanced solar plant would accelerate and boost solar additions to 1,000 megawatts by 2032 to address potential data center interest in carbon-free generation, or a faster than projected decline in solar prices. Based on our analysis of current factors, we see potential additional generation needs ranging from 2,700 to 3,200 megawatts with associated capital investments, including the environmental retrofits for coal plants of $6 billion to $7 billion through 2035 using current pricing estimates. We also evaluated the prospects of joining an RTO in our review of options, which concluded that we would be introducing significant unquantifiable risk to our customers, which is not surprising based on what we are seeing in other RTOs. Our next steps in the IRP process to engage with the KPSC over the next few months and discuss the various plans we've provided. We would expect to file an additional CPCN request as early as the first quarter of next year to address near-term generation needs for our customers. Moving to slide 6 and an update on data center development, our Pennsylvania and Kentucky service territories continue to attract growing interest from data center developers. In our Pennsylvania service territory, we now have over 39 gigawatts in our queue with 8 gigawatts in advanced stages of planning, up from the 5 gigawatts we highlighted during our second quarter call in August. We estimate these 8 gigawatts represent incremental PPL capital needs of $600 million to $700 million in the 2025 to 2029 time frame, none of which are reflected in our current capital plan. Note that we have included these types of projects in our latest PJM large load forecast, which shows that PPL Electric has the second highest projected peak load additions in PJM through the end of this decade. It's important to note that projects in the queue may include duplicates due to developers assessing multiple sites for the same project. And it's important to highlight that all the projects in our queues are in front of the meter projects. Projects in the advanced planning stages have signed agreements. They are in various stages of PJM's review process with some having completed those reviews. Costs incurred by PPL for these projects are reimbursable by developers even if they do not move forward with the projects. Recall that each new data center connection will lower transmission costs for customers. The savings are expected to occur as the data center load ramps up over the next several years, and the data centers begin to pay transmission charges. In terms of the amount, we estimate that for the first gigawatt of data center demand that's connected to the grid, our residential customers could save nearly 10% on the transmission portion of their bill, assuming a PPL investment level of about $100 million, which for the average residential customer and based on current rates, would represent about $3 per month in savings. While additional data center connections will also lower transmission costs for customers, the amount of those savings will depend on a number of factors, including timing of load ramp, the amount of investments required and the peak load on our system. Turning to Kentucky, we have about 400 megawatts in advanced stages of planning with potential to increase up to 1 gig. Active data center requests in Kentucky now total nearly 3 gigawatts of potential demand, an increase from 2 gigawatts at the time of our second quarter call. As in Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades in Kentucky would be additive to our capital plan, although the more significant capital investments in Kentucky would arise from any incremental generation investments. As I shared earlier, the recommended plan in our IRP projects a need for additional natural gas and battery storage beyond what was in our CPCN approved last year to support longer term economic development and data center load growth. Moving to Slide 7 and several key operational and regulatory updates. LG&E and KU responded well to the remnants of Hurricane Helene, which knocked out power to more than 224,000 customers and resulted in 1,600 down wires and 160 broken poles. This storm was the fourth most significant weather event for the region in the last 20 years. We restored 95% of our customers within four days and all customers capable of receiving service within six days. And a great example of our One PPL strategy, crews from our Pennsylvania operations in more than 40 contract resources aided in the effort. We've since requested regulatory asset treatment for about $11 million in operating expenses tied to our restoration efforts. Once our restoration efforts in Kentucky were complete, we were proud to send over 400 employees and contractors from our utilities in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Kentucky, to support our colleagues in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia, following the significant damage sustained by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Mutual assistance is one of those areas that makes our industry truly unique. And I thank all the men and women on our teams that provided that much needed support. I also thank all the men and women from ComEd, Duquesne Light, NIPSCO, and CenterPoint that helped us in our efforts to restore power to our Kentucky customers during Hurricane Helene. And other updates from Kentucky. In October, we filed a request with the KPSC to recover $125 million in retirement costs associated with Mill Creek 1, which is set to retire by the end of this year. We requested approval to recover the cost through the Retired Asset Recovery Rider or RAR in our first filing under this new mechanism. The rider provides cost recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement of such assets as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital. The implementation of the RAR rider, if approved, will result in a slight build credit for customers beginning in May 2025 based on the current procedural schedule established by the commission. Turning to Pennsylvania. Our disk waiver petition to increase the disk revenue cap from 5% to 9% continues to proceed through the process as expected. We've completed the briefing process and anticipate a recommended decision in November from the ALJ that's assigned to the case with a PUC decision to follow in early 2025. Also in Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities yesterday announced new price to compare rates effective December 1. The new residential price to compare represents about a 2% decrease compared to last year's winter price to compare price. In all aspects of our business, our companies remain very focused on affordability for our customers. This focus also extends to how we purchase power for non-shopping customers in PA. With this in mind, we were pleased to reach a settlement with the parties to our latest default service program and procurement plan filed with the PUC. We are seeking approval of our plan to procure electricity from June 1, 2025, through May 31, 2029, to meet PPL Electric's provider of last resort obligations. Our latest plan, which we filed in March includes modifications to the current product mix and auction timing that PPL Electric uses to buy power. These modifications are intended to strengthen price stability and lower prices for customers, while supporting resource adequacy and fostering the continued growth of renewable generation. We expect the PUC decision on the settlement by the end of year. Shifting to Rhode Island. I am pleased to report that we completed the integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL in the third quarter, exiting the transition services entered into with National Grid when we acquired Rhode Island Energy in May 2022. I can't say enough about how well our teams rallied as One PPL to deliver this outcome, which involved exiting more than 130 transition services in phases over the past two years. It was truly a team effort from Rhode Island to Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as everyone at National Grid that works so hard to make the transition possible. We're excited to have Rhode Island Energy now fully integrated to best serve our customers. Finally, in September, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission approved the company's winter last resort service rates as filed. The rate for non-shopping residential customers effective October 1, reflects an 8% decrease from last year's winter rate, and we're pleased to be able to pass those savings on to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 9. PPL's third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.29 per share compared to $0.31 per share in Q3 2023. We recorded special items of $0.13 per share during the third quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.42 per share, a decrease of $0.01 per share compared to Q3 2023. Returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes primarily due to favorable weather in Kentucky were more than offset by higher operating and financing costs quarter-over-quarter. For Q3 2024, we estimate that weather was about $0.01 favorable compared to normal conditions with cooling degree days up about 13% in our Kentucky territories over the quarter. Turning to full year. Through the first nine months of 2024, our GAAP earnings are now at $0.96 per share, compared to $0.85 per share through the same period last year. Adjusting for special items recorded through the third quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $1.34 per share for the first nine months of 2024. This represents an improvement of $0.14 per share, compared to the same period a year ago, which puts us in great shape heading into the fourth quarter to achieve our financial targets for 2024. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the third quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results were flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. Kentucky's results were driven by higher sales volumes due to the favorable weather, offset by an adjustment to environmental cost recovery revenues that was recognized during the quarter. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was driven by higher operating costs in several areas, including higher storm costs, increased vegetation management and an increase in uncollectibles. These higher operating costs were partially offset by higher transmission revenues. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable adjustment to property taxes. And finally, results at Corporate and Other decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher interest expense due to an increase in long-term debt. In Q3, we were opportunistic amidst increased market volatility and issued $750 million of senior notes at PPL Capital funding at a rate of 5.25% that mature in 2034. We saw significant demand for the deal, which we believe is attributable to PPL's excellent credit position with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. With another solid quarter behind us, we're on track to deliver on our financial targets for our shareowners. We expect to exceed the midpoint of our original 2024 ongoing earnings forecast as reflected in our updated forecast range of $1.67 to $1.73 per share with a midpoint of $1.70 per share, and we remain extremely well positioned for continued long-term growth. As Vince outlined, we see an improving fundamental backdrop that we believe will require significant capital investments to advance our Utility of the Future strategy that can satisfy our customers' evolving needs and ensure we can continue to deliver safe and reliable service. We strategically positioned PPL with the financial flexibility needed to support these critical investments while continuing to deliver on our earnings growth targets, but we're as excited as we've ever been for the prospects of PPL. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, we continue deliver across the board on our commitments to share owners and customers in the third quarter. This includes executing our capital plans on time and on budget to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency, advancing sustainable efficiencies to help keep energy affordable for our customers, completing the successful integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL, responding quickly and effectively to major storms to restore power and peace of mind for our customers and communities and advancing responsible generation investments in Kentucky as well responsible resource planning to deliver a safe, reliable, affordable and cleaner energy mix. As we work to close out 2024, I continue to be very proud of our team here at PPL. I'm confident in our Utility of the Future strategy. I'm proud progress we're making as we execute that strategy, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we move into 2025. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning, good morning. Vince, I know sort of this resource adequacy topic has been kind of a perennial question with the Eastern wires companies during this earnings season. And obviously, to your credit, you've been one of the first to highlight the issues and kind of talk about the solutions over a year ago. The auction is now delayed. I guess, not sure you guys are all aligned. But I guess, where do we stand with the solution there? Could we see a bill introduced in Pennsylvania effectively proposing to allow the wireless companies to own a certain amount of peaking assets and base rates? Is it Texas type energy fund enough? I guess what should we be watching for on the legislative side? How should we be thinking about all the different pieces out there? Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes, there's a lot there in that question, Shar. Let me maybe just how I'm thinking about this issue broadly. So the auction itself, the delay, look, I think that just reinforces the need for the state to take control of this issue. So I truly hope that Pennsylvania continues to pursue state solutions, and does not slow that down as a result of the delay in the auction. I do think and fully expect that PJM will make some improvements on the supply side of the equation with the delay, but I also expect them to include an uploaded -- an updated load forecast, which, of course, will include the incremental data center load. So we'd expect that to be higher as well. So at this point, I can't predict whether capacity prices will be lower in the next auction, which is for the 2026, 2027 plan a year compared to the 270 that printed for the 2025 2026 planning year, just given the different moving parts on both the supply and the demand side. In terms of timing of legislation, we've always been operating under an expectation that, that would occur sometime in early 2025 anyway. Again, hopeful that, that would not be delayed as a result of the auction. I think the need and the criticality of this issue, the urgency of this issue is such that we need to continue to move forward at the pace we've been working with. We continue our discussions with all of the important decision-makers, the Governor's office, the state legislature as well as the PUC. In fact, the PUC has scheduled a resource adequacy technical conference towards the end of this month; we'll be participating in that. And then as we've talked in the past, just thinking about what this legislation could look like, obviously, we don't have anything out there right now to comment on. But as I think about the options, obviously, there's the permitting of utilities to invest in generation, which we've been talking about, and they could support us in building that new generation in the state, putting it in rate base. I think on the market side, Shar, they can provide low interest loans to the generators, similar to what they did in Texas with that low interest fund. I think they can also create some incentives for utilities and the IPPs to enter into long-term power purchase agreements, beyond what we are currently able to do under our default service plan. So we have some ability to do that, but it's not as extensive as I think potentially they could incentivize us to do. So from our perspective, look, we continue to believe that allowing the utilities to directly invest in the generation would be the most impactful and getting generation built in the state, certainly in the time frame necessary to address the gaps that we're seeing around resource adequacy. But look, I think it's reasonable to believe or expect that any new legislation in the state could include some or all of these ideas.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. I guess, we'll stay tuned there. And then on just the Kentucky side, you touched on it a little bit on your pre-pareds. But if we look at all this kind of advanced stage data center demand, I guess, how do we think about the capital requirements to these versus the current plan. Is there the same transmission sensitivity as Pennsylvania there? I know we have to wait for the capital update, but just maybe a little bit of color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yeah. So generally, the opportunity or the requirement really for additional CapEx around transmission related to the data centers, it's just less than it is in Kentucky as opposed to PA, and that's primarily because we're dealing with those supply constraints with generation. And so we're very opportunistic in where we build that generation. And so taking advantage of our existing sites, where we have generation, where we may be retiring certain assets, we just don't need to make as much investment in transmission, Shar. Really, the material capital requirement is around the generation, which you saw in the updated IRP.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks so much. I'll pass it to someone else and see you in about a week.\nVince Sorgi: Looking forward to it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much.\nVince Sorgi: Hi, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Wondering just as you think about this first CPCN, it could come pretty soon, but what maybe specifically might be included in that first one Kentucky related to the IRP. Would you potentially be looking out to that 2030 generation need? And would there be a gas plant potentially in this first round?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. Around timing, as I said, I think we could follow the IRP with the CPCN filing as early as the first quarter. I think under any scenario that we're looking at, it's pretty clear that we need to at least get moving on the second CCGT to be in service in 2030. So that's really driving, I would say, the need to get the CPCN filed as soon as we can. The team will be looking at all of the various supply recommendations to see what we include in the CPCN versus future on. But clearly, I would expect at least that second CCGT likely the one in 2031, some of the other dispatchable gen maybe in the 2028 time frame like the batteries, et cetera. So when we look at really the batteries and the SCR on gen, those are really in there to create and extend dispatchable generation for what we see as more immediate demand increases coming from the data center. So obviously, it takes some time right now to get the combined cycle still right now, we're looking at 2030, and then 2031 at the earliest. So some of those, again, batteries in the SCR to keep that supply there while that demand is ramping up more near-term.\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah. Got you. Okay. That's clear. That makes sense. And then I guess as you -- I guess, in Kentucky, like how speculative is the data center outlook? I mean, you've described kind of what stage it's at right now. I'm just wondering, is it far along enough to give the commission confidence now that that these investments are needed -- you do need this generation. Obviously, it's a pretty big ramp-up in the data center outlook, but probably maybe more uncertainty than usual. So how are you thinking about that?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah, sure. I mean clearly -- so the data center load is not the only large load that we're seeing come to fruition in Kentucky, especially with all of the economic development that's been occurring there over the last few years. So the demand curve, that mid-low demand curve that we put in the recommended case, we feel really good about, Dave, in terms of data centers, in particular, again, where we're seeing 400 megawatts at the advanced stage active discussions to upsize that to a gigawatt. That's all we put in the mid-load case. So we're obviously looking at 3 gigs overall. That continues to grow quarter after quarter. So we're pretty confident with that that 1 gig we included in the middle of the case.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. That's helpful context. Thanks so much.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to take a finer point to some of the conversation on data centers as you outlined there. Specifically, as far as the time line of formal deal announcements, if you have any thoughts on how that could materialize and just kind of the cadence over time? Just trying to get a feel for when the CapEx really start to enter the plan incrementally based on what could happen there?\nVincent Sorgi: Yes, sure. So I think we're actually getting close on some of these announcements. And I think, once you see the first one or two, right, it will probably prompt some others to make announcements as well. Obviously, there's a huge competitive component, at least on the hyperscaler side with these announcements. And so not getting too far out and showing your competitive position around your region, I think is a pretty critical kind of communication strategy on the hyperscalers part. But I think once those announcement start, I would suspect that you'll kind of see the floodgates open. So again, getting close on the first one, I would suspect by the end of the year, at least on our first large one, and then we'll see going into 2025, what follows from that.\nJeremy Tonet: Very helpful. Thank you for that. And then shifting gears to Kentucky, we have observed a very constructive relationship, I think, with the PPL and the commission over time here. But now that we have kind of a new composition, just wondering if you could provide any updated thoughts on how you see that relationship at this point in time.\nVince Sorgi : Yes. Look, I think the relationship is incredibly constructive. As you said, we've always operated under a constructive regulatory construct. In Kentucky, I think part of that is because our team is thoughtful. Their analysis is deep. It's well supported with -- conclusions or our recommendations are well supported with the analysis and the depth and breadth of that analysis. As you know, I think the commission uses our operations as a model in the state when they're dealing with some others. So generally, it's been quite positive. We've met with the new commission. Nothing coming out of that that discussion would lead me to believe that, relationship would be anything different with this new commission moving forward. So we're feeling good. Obviously, the commissions have full staff now with the three commissioners. Angie Hatton, who was the Vice Chair is now the Chair and then John [indiscernible] just joined in September. So with that appointment, we have a full complement. And again, I would expect the constructive nature of that relationship to continue.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's good to hear. I'll leave it there.\nVince Sorgi : Great.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team. Good morning. Thanks for giving the time. Good morning.\nVince Sorgi : Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Vince. Hey, just on the comment of one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, I totally agree there. I would just kind of -- don't want to front run your Q4 update. But just can you talk to whether you think you'll need equity in the plan or not just given the cadence of CapEx raises? Maybe any color you can share there would be helpful. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi : Yes. Look, it does sound like you're trying to front run the year-end call. That's okay. Joe, do you want to talk about that?\nJoe Bergstein : Sure. Thanks for the question, Durgesh. Yes. So I mean, look, there's numerous factors that go into determining our financing needs, and we are going through the business planning process now and evaluating those factors, including additional capital needs. And those needs are beyond what would be in the next CPCN filing. We're seeing additional needs for things like grid modernization, grid resiliency given the more severe and frequent storms that we're seeing across all of our territories, digital transformation, transmission to support data centers and other load growth. And we've clearly been on a trend of identifying additional capital spend, which is driving higher rate base growth and I think, in fact, each year since we've had the strategic repositioning, our rate base growth has increased by about 100 basis points in each iteration of the plan. And I certainly expect that trend to continue in our next update. So, we'll evaluate our financing needs in context of that broader plan update and provide you our expectations on the year-end call. But we are in great shape given our excellent credit position, and we have flexibility to develop a plan that maximizes value for our shareowners. And we continue to feel really good about our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets even with the additional capital needs that we expect in this next update.\nDurgesh Chopra: That\u2019s excellent. Thanks for that color Joe. Maybe just a follow-up to that capital allocation question is some of your peers have lowered dividend growth to support higher EPS growth. Now again, like going back to your comments around very strong balance sheet, which it is. Just maybe give us your thoughts there as you make those capital allocation decisions, dividend, equity earnings growth?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, I mean all of those things go into our consideration for our financing needs and the overall plan. But I think where we've seen that occur is in -- with companies that have had not the strength of a balance sheet that we have. So that's not our intention at this time.\nDurgesh Chopra: Very clear. Thank you.\nJoe Bergstein: Great. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning team.\nVince Sorgi: Good morning Paul.\nPaul Zimbardo: I know you hit a lot on the generation and like the data center transmission needs as well. I was just hoping you could frame the scope of the PJM RTEP. Just looking at the proposals there, it seems like there could be a lot in PPL zone like around Three Mile Island as well. Just hoping there's any quantification or details you could provide on potential incremental from that area as well.\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Thanks, Paul. So, we did submit a number of projects to resolve the issues that were identified in the most recent window. We should know what projects, if any, are selected from that window in the December, January time frame. And of course, we'll be able to reflect those in our updated plan on the year-end call. But look, I would say regardless of what is selected in this window, we continue to believe that there will be significant transmission opportunities in Pennsylvania for the foreseeable future. And that's really stemming from the strong economic development, including the data center load that we're seeing in just the resource needs in the region. But I think you're aware, but if not, the vast, vast majority of our transmission spend is not derived from these RTEP open windows. So we really view these as incremental opportunities for us, not baked into our capital planning for transmission.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Yes. No, definitely understood on that point. And then one other on the Kentucky IRP, like a two-parter. Just did you disclose what the potential customer bill impact could be for the base plan you're recommending? And just more holistically, it's a lot of capital, a lot of construction, just your comfort with ability to get the workers and kind of the behind-the-scenes things to execute such a big plan. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Sure. Yes, sure. So, all of that will go into our filing of the CPCN. So, the IRP is not -- it's not a rate case. It's not a filing where we're requesting rate adjustments or anything like that. So, we will include and look at all of that as we're contemplating what we filed in CPCN in the first quarter. We do have the coal plants retiring and continuing to depreciate, which provides bill headroom there. Obviously, RARR [ph] which is the first time we're using that, which is that retired asset recovery mechanism in Kentucky that takes the net book value at the date of retirement and then spreads it out over a future 10-year period. So, any retirements associated with this plan would likely use that mechanism, which, again, reduces customer bills. So overall, when we look at our rate case timing and strategies, we're always thinking about affordability and making sure that we balance our ability to get these very critical investments approved, but at the same time, making sure that we're keeping bill impacts within the inflationary amounts as best we can, and I don't think we'll have an issue of being able to do that as we implement the CPCN standing on the IRP.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Great. And just any overall thoughts on like labor, construction just execution ability?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So no concerns on getting a battery installed in 2028, I think really what you're highlighting is the reason why the next CCGT would not be able to go in service until 2030 and then the one after that in 2031. So obviously, we used to be able to get combined cycle plants done in a 3-ish time period. It's now 5% [ph]. That's really due to supply chain constraints. To your point, not just on the turbines themselves, but with the EPC contractors and getting enough folks to do all this work, so that is exactly in that driving that 2030-'31 time frame.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Understood. Thanks for the update.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So I wanted to talk about that 8 gigs of data center load or potential data center load. And I know that you point out that some of it might be double counting of some of the low growth that you see in other areas. But you, as one of the few companies in PJM, operate in a zone which is heavily oversupplied with power. You chose to have an amicable relationship with power companies and data centers. And more importantly, you already have one large data center being developed in your service territory in Pennsylvania. And as little as I know about hyperscalers, then they tend to operate in clusters, right? So that definitely bodes well for future investments in your zone. I mean, do you see it like that? I mean, is there something that you think -- I mean don't you think that you actually have a strong competitive advantage versus other utilities across the PJM data center loads?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, absolutely, 100%. So first of all, I would say that the duplicate projects, we don't see any duplicates in the 8 gigs. All of those, we think, again, those are in advanced stages. We think those are very likely to come to fruition. The duplicate is in the 39 total interest that we have. We do think there could be some of those that are duplicated. But I think the 8 gigs, we're feeling good about as those progress. And to your point, the more -- especially when you're thinking about all the points that you just made, where we are in PJM, where we are with generation supply, but even just how the formula rate works and being in an RTO, the more generation you add that actually -- or the more load you have, especially at these levels, it ends up bringing down kind of the average cost per gigawatt of load for the data centers. So to your exact point, the more you build, the cheaper it becomes on a per unit basis over time. And so I 100% agree with you, and that's why we're making sure that we can support this and we feel very good with our ability to connect this, and it's really on the generation side, which you know we've been active on that side within PJM to make sure outside of PA and even within PA, we're continuing to build generation. But on the transmission side, we feel very comfortable with our ability to not only connect the 8 gigs, but to continue to connect beyond that.\nAngie Storozynski: And then separately on the quantification of the transmission benefits for customers. I mean -- so I mean, you wouldn't be able to retain it, right? So that's not an earnings driver per se, right, because you're capped on returns on existing transmission assets, it just provides the customer bill room for either additional investments or to absorb rising energy and capacity prices. Is that fair?\nVince Sorgi: That's exactly correct. Yes.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Angie.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Paz of Wolfe. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hey, good morning, Dave.\nDavid Paz: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Apologies, if you've already kind of addressed this, I may have miss it. But as we think of the things you're talking about on the significant capital investment opportunities, our strong positioning. What are the headwinds that would keep you from -- maybe keep you at or below even the midpoint of your 6% to 8%. I'm just trying to figure out why a lot of these things aren't the same, won't translate into more robust EPS growth? Thanks.\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, hi, David, it's Joe Bergstein. Yes, I think as I said earlier, we're going through the business plan process now. We'll give a full update on all of this -- on the year-end call. But as you think about our earned growth now and the drivers of that, it's driven by a mix of energy efficiencies and rate base growth. And clearly, we've been talking about that transitioning to the more traditional rate base growth driven earnings growth profile. And I think we're -- we've been seeing that through the -- since the repositioning with each of the play an updates as I've indicated, and I expect that trend to continue where we'll be -- earnings growth will be driven by rate base growth as we move forward. And I think that's what you'll clearly see that in the next iteration of plan.\nDavid Paz: I got it. All right. So the 6, 3 or so currently on the rate base growth, that could rise, but your O&M savings tailwinds supplied a little net-net. But maybe -- I guess it depends on how much you're adding, which we'll find out in February, but that all make sense. Thank you.\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah, I think high level, that's correct. We'll continue on the O&M efficiency strategy, but we'll need to make capital investments to achieve those O&M savings.\nDavid Paz: Great. Thank you. And just on the resource adequacy conference. Do you anticipate -- how will that beat into, if at all, the legislative process for whatever the solutions may be there in Pennsylvania for generation?\nVince Sorgi: Yeah. Well, I do think the PUC will have an active role in administering any legislation that could ultimately get approved there. So I think the PUC engaging in this topic to understand the nuances of it, the magnitude of it and then potentially how they may have to alter their internal procedures, et cetera, to potentially administer some law, I think, is really constructive. So again, there's no law on the books that we're responding to or anything like that, but I think the commission is preparing accordingly in the event something happens there, so that they can really do their part. Again, I would expect the commission will have a significant role in administering whatever this legislation could look like.\nDavid Paz: Great. Thank you.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead.\nGregg Orrill: Hi, thank you. What's the latest thinking on the timing of general rate cases in your jurisdictions?\nJoe Bergstein: Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. It's Joe. So well, I would say based on our current plan, which again, we're in the process of updating, we would have a rate case in Kentucky in first half of next year at the at the earliest. We have a stay-out provision from the last rate case that ends at the end of June of next year. So rate case potentially likely after that. In Rhode Island, it's likely the fourth quarter of 2025. Again, there, we had an agreement as part of the acquisition that we would not file a rate case until we were off of the TSAs for 12 months, and we did complete the TSAs in September. So that's why it looks like the fourth quarter of next year. And then in Pennsylvania, based on the current plan that's 2026 at the earliest, but we'll assess the timing of all -- of these as we're going through the business plan update and give you an update on the year-end call.\nGregg Orrill: Thank you very much.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks, Gregg.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thanks so much to everybody for joining us today. Really looking forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the not-too-distant future, so we will see you then. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from our third quarter performance on Slide 4. Today, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share. Adjusting for special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.42 per share. Given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we narrowed our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast to $1.67 to $1.73 per share from the prior forecast range of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. As a result, we've increased the midpoint of $0.01 to $1.70 per share. Throughout the third quarter, we continue to make excellent progress on delivering our 2024 priorities. We're on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable and cleaner energy future for our customers. And through our ongoing business transformation initiatives, we're on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of $120 million to $130 million this year compared our 2021 baseline O&M. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth through at least 2027. We're focused on executing our capital plan, which includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027, with continued potential upside driven by data center connections in Pennsylvania and Kentucky, new generation in Kentucky, new enterprise-wide technology investments and additional resiliency investments across all of our jurisdictions as we combat more frequent and severe storms. And across PPL, we continue to drive efficiencies through our Utility of the Future strategy, keeping us on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026, which again is compared to our 2021 baseline. Moving to Slide 5. On October 18, LG&E and KU submitted their updated Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. The IRP provides a robust analysis of a wide range of variables, including demand growth, fuel prices, supply-side resource costs, and pending environmental regulations, all to guide our resource planning. This year's IRP examined 300 potential resource portfolio and fuel price combinations to arrive at a plan to most effectively meet forecasted demand over the next 15 years. It's important to note that the IRP is submitted for informational purposes only. That said, the detailed analysis provides reasonable insights about future generation needs and helps us to identify no regrets recommendations, given there is uncertainty with some of the inputs. Key drivers in our latest IRP analysis, includes stronger demand forecast and higher costs for new supply-side resources from what we saw in our last IRP, which was filed three years ago in 2021. In terms of demand, our mid-load scenario reflects load growth of nearly 1.5% annually through 2039. But more importantly, projects annual load growth of over 3% through 2032, which is significantly impacted by projected data center load. We evaluated several scenarios for data centers ranging from 0 to nearly 2 gigawatts of new load by 2032 with the mid-load scenario assuming just over 1 gigawatt. Based on the interest levels that LG&E and KU have already seen from developers, we view no or low data center growth as unlikely. Regarding the cost of new generation, we've seen those costs increase markedly since our 2021 IRP except for batteries. That increases the relative value of our existing generation resources and significantly impacted the generation mix recommended in this year's IRP. Regarding the battery costs, this is the first time in our ongoing resource planning that the sum of capital and non-fuel O&M costs for battery storage with tax incentives included is less than the cost of new simple-cycle combustion turbines. For this reason, our recommended plan includes the addition of 900 megawatts of battery storage. Importantly, due to the price increases in solar generation, we are not assuming the 637 megawatts of solar PPAs that were approved by the KPSC and our 2022 CPCN get built. As noted in our IRP, the impact of environmental regulations remains a key uncertainty as three major regulations are the subject of current federal court challenges. Our IRP modeled four different environmental regulation scenarios ranging from none to all of the regulations becoming enforceable. The updated IRP assumes all resources and retirements approved in our last CPCN proceeding are completed as planned by 2028, except for the solar PPAs that I just mentioned. This includes our approved plans to retire 600 megawatts of aging coal and 50 megawatts of aging peaking units by 2027. In addition, it includes building a new 640-megawatt natural gas combined cycle unit, 240 megawatts of company-owned solar, and 125 megawatts of battery storage. Above and beyond this generation, the IRP lays out several resource plans, including two we've referenced on this slide, a recommended resource plan, as well as an enhanced solar applicable in certain scenarios. The recommended plan reflects our no-regrets approach to planning, much like our latest CPCN filing and includes important generation development even if scenarios that reflect high economic load growth or CO2 regulations do not come to fruition. This plant projects the need to build an additional 2,700 megawatts of new generation from 2028 through 2035 to safely, reliably and affordably serve future demand growth. This includes two new 650-megawatt combined cycle natural gas plants, one in 2030 and another one in 2031. It includes the addition of 400 megawatts of new battery storage in 2028 and 500 megawatts of additional battery storage in 2035. It also includes 500 megawatts of solar in 2035. The recommended plan also projects the need to add new environmental controls at the Gen and Trimble County coal plants to ensure compliance with ELG and NOx regulations. The enhanced solar plan meanwhile differs from the recommended plan only in the timing and level of new solar generation added, rather than adding 500 megawatts of solar in 2035, the enhanced solar plant would accelerate and boost solar additions to 1,000 megawatts by 2032 to address potential data center interest in carbon-free generation, or a faster than projected decline in solar prices. Based on our analysis of current factors, we see potential additional generation needs ranging from 2,700 to 3,200 megawatts with associated capital investments, including the environmental retrofits for coal plants of $6 billion to $7 billion through 2035 using current pricing estimates. We also evaluated the prospects of joining an RTO in our review of options, which concluded that we would be introducing significant unquantifiable risk to our customers, which is not surprising based on what we are seeing in other RTOs. Our next steps in the IRP process to engage with the KPSC over the next few months and discuss the various plans we've provided. We would expect to file an additional CPCN request as early as the first quarter of next year to address near-term generation needs for our customers. Moving to slide 6 and an update on data center development, our Pennsylvania and Kentucky service territories continue to attract growing interest from data center developers. In our Pennsylvania service territory, we now have over 39 gigawatts in our queue with 8 gigawatts in advanced stages of planning, up from the 5 gigawatts we highlighted during our second quarter call in August. We estimate these 8 gigawatts represent incremental PPL capital needs of $600 million to $700 million in the 2025 to 2029 time frame, none of which are reflected in our current capital plan. Note that we have included these types of projects in our latest PJM large load forecast, which shows that PPL Electric has the second highest projected peak load additions in PJM through the end of this decade. It's important to note that projects in the queue may include duplicates due to developers assessing multiple sites for the same project. And it's important to highlight that all the projects in our queues are in front of the meter projects. Projects in the advanced planning stages have signed agreements. They are in various stages of PJM's review process with some having completed those reviews. Costs incurred by PPL for these projects are reimbursable by developers even if they do not move forward with the projects. Recall that each new data center connection will lower transmission costs for customers. The savings are expected to occur as the data center load ramps up over the next several years, and the data centers begin to pay transmission charges. In terms of the amount, we estimate that for the first gigawatt of data center demand that's connected to the grid, our residential customers could save nearly 10% on the transmission portion of their bill, assuming a PPL investment level of about $100 million, which for the average residential customer and based on current rates, would represent about $3 per month in savings. While additional data center connections will also lower transmission costs for customers, the amount of those savings will depend on a number of factors, including timing of load ramp, the amount of investments required and the peak load on our system. Turning to Kentucky, we have about 400 megawatts in advanced stages of planning with potential to increase up to 1 gig. Active data center requests in Kentucky now total nearly 3 gigawatts of potential demand, an increase from 2 gigawatts at the time of our second quarter call. As in Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades in Kentucky would be additive to our capital plan, although the more significant capital investments in Kentucky would arise from any incremental generation investments. As I shared earlier, the recommended plan in our IRP projects a need for additional natural gas and battery storage beyond what was in our CPCN approved last year to support longer term economic development and data center load growth. Moving to Slide 7 and several key operational and regulatory updates. LG&E and KU responded well to the remnants of Hurricane Helene, which knocked out power to more than 224,000 customers and resulted in 1,600 down wires and 160 broken poles. This storm was the fourth most significant weather event for the region in the last 20 years. We restored 95% of our customers within four days and all customers capable of receiving service within six days. And a great example of our One PPL strategy, crews from our Pennsylvania operations in more than 40 contract resources aided in the effort. We've since requested regulatory asset treatment for about $11 million in operating expenses tied to our restoration efforts. Once our restoration efforts in Kentucky were complete, we were proud to send over 400 employees and contractors from our utilities in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Kentucky, to support our colleagues in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia, following the significant damage sustained by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. Mutual assistance is one of those areas that makes our industry truly unique. And I thank all the men and women on our teams that provided that much needed support. I also thank all the men and women from ComEd, Duquesne Light, NIPSCO, and CenterPoint that helped us in our efforts to restore power to our Kentucky customers during Hurricane Helene. And other updates from Kentucky. In October, we filed a request with the KPSC to recover $125 million in retirement costs associated with Mill Creek 1, which is set to retire by the end of this year. We requested approval to recover the cost through the Retired Asset Recovery Rider or RAR in our first filing under this new mechanism. The rider provides cost recovery over a 10-year period upon retirement of such assets as well as a return on those investments at the utilities than weighted average cost of capital. The implementation of the RAR rider, if approved, will result in a slight build credit for customers beginning in May 2025 based on the current procedural schedule established by the commission. Turning to Pennsylvania. Our disk waiver petition to increase the disk revenue cap from 5% to 9% continues to proceed through the process as expected. We've completed the briefing process and anticipate a recommended decision in November from the ALJ that's assigned to the case with a PUC decision to follow in early 2025. Also in Pennsylvania, PPL Electric Utilities yesterday announced new price to compare rates effective December 1. The new residential price to compare represents about a 2% decrease compared to last year's winter price to compare price. In all aspects of our business, our companies remain very focused on affordability for our customers. This focus also extends to how we purchase power for non-shopping customers in PA. With this in mind, we were pleased to reach a settlement with the parties to our latest default service program and procurement plan filed with the PUC. We are seeking approval of our plan to procure electricity from June 1, 2025, through May 31, 2029, to meet PPL Electric's provider of last resort obligations. Our latest plan, which we filed in March includes modifications to the current product mix and auction timing that PPL Electric uses to buy power. These modifications are intended to strengthen price stability and lower prices for customers, while supporting resource adequacy and fostering the continued growth of renewable generation. We expect the PUC decision on the settlement by the end of year. Shifting to Rhode Island. I am pleased to report that we completed the integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL in the third quarter, exiting the transition services entered into with National Grid when we acquired Rhode Island Energy in May 2022. I can't say enough about how well our teams rallied as One PPL to deliver this outcome, which involved exiting more than 130 transition services in phases over the past two years. It was truly a team effort from Rhode Island to Pennsylvania to Kentucky, as well as everyone at National Grid that works so hard to make the transition possible. We're excited to have Rhode Island Energy now fully integrated to best serve our customers. Finally, in September, the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission approved the company's winter last resort service rates as filed. The rate for non-shopping residential customers effective October 1, reflects an 8% decrease from last year's winter rate, and we're pleased to be able to pass those savings on to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, we continue deliver across the board on our commitments to share owners and customers in the third quarter. This includes executing our capital plans on time and on budget to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency, advancing sustainable efficiencies to help keep energy affordable for our customers, completing the successful integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL, responding quickly and effectively to major storms to restore power and peace of mind for our customers and communities and advancing responsible generation investments in Kentucky as well responsible resource planning to deliver a safe, reliable, affordable and cleaner energy mix. As we work to close out 2024, I continue to be very proud of our team here at PPL. I'm confident in our Utility of the Future strategy. I'm proud progress we're making as we execute that strategy, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we move into 2025. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Good morning, Shar. Yes, there's a lot there in that question, Shar. Let me maybe just how I'm thinking about this issue broadly. So the auction itself, the delay, look, I think that just reinforces the need for the state to take control of this issue. So I truly hope that Pennsylvania continues to pursue state solutions, and does not slow that down as a result of the delay in the auction. I do think and fully expect that PJM will make some improvements on the supply side of the equation with the delay, but I also expect them to include an uploaded -- an updated load forecast, which, of course, will include the incremental data center load. So we'd expect that to be higher as well. So at this point, I can't predict whether capacity prices will be lower in the next auction, which is for the 2026, 2027 plan a year compared to the 270 that printed for the 2025 2026 planning year, just given the different moving parts on both the supply and the demand side. In terms of timing of legislation, we've always been operating under an expectation that, that would occur sometime in early 2025 anyway. Again, hopeful that, that would not be delayed as a result of the auction. I think the need and the criticality of this issue, the urgency of this issue is such that we need to continue to move forward at the pace we've been working with. We continue our discussions with all of the important decision-makers, the Governor's office, the state legislature as well as the PUC. In fact, the PUC has scheduled a resource adequacy technical conference towards the end of this month; we'll be participating in that. And then as we've talked in the past, just thinking about what this legislation could look like, obviously, we don't have anything out there right now to comment on. But as I think about the options, obviously, there's the permitting of utilities to invest in generation, which we've been talking about, and they could support us in building that new generation in the state, putting it in rate base. I think on the market side, Shar, they can provide low interest loans to the generators, similar to what they did in Texas with that low interest fund. I think they can also create some incentives for utilities and the IPPs to enter into long-term power purchase agreements, beyond what we are currently able to do under our default service plan. So we have some ability to do that, but it's not as extensive as I think potentially they could incentivize us to do. So from our perspective, look, we continue to believe that allowing the utilities to directly invest in the generation would be the most impactful and getting generation built in the state, certainly in the time frame necessary to address the gaps that we're seeing around resource adequacy. But look, I think it's reasonable to believe or expect that any new legislation in the state could include some or all of these ideas. Yeah. So generally, the opportunity or the requirement really for additional CapEx around transmission related to the data centers, it's just less than it is in Kentucky as opposed to PA, and that's primarily because we're dealing with those supply constraints with generation. And so we're very opportunistic in where we build that generation. And so taking advantage of our existing sites, where we have generation, where we may be retiring certain assets, we just don't need to make as much investment in transmission, Shar. Really, the material capital requirement is around the generation, which you saw in the updated IRP. Looking forward to it. Thanks. Hi, David. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. Around timing, as I said, I think we could follow the IRP with the CPCN filing as early as the first quarter. I think under any scenario that we're looking at, it's pretty clear that we need to at least get moving on the second CCGT to be in service in 2030. So that's really driving, I would say, the need to get the CPCN filed as soon as we can. The team will be looking at all of the various supply recommendations to see what we include in the CPCN versus future on. But clearly, I would expect at least that second CCGT likely the one in 2031, some of the other dispatchable gen maybe in the 2028 time frame like the batteries, et cetera. So when we look at really the batteries and the SCR on gen, those are really in there to create and extend dispatchable generation for what we see as more immediate demand increases coming from the data center. So obviously, it takes some time right now to get the combined cycle still right now, we're looking at 2030, and then 2031 at the earliest. So some of those, again, batteries in the SCR to keep that supply there while that demand is ramping up more near-term. Yeah, sure. I mean clearly -- so the data center load is not the only large load that we're seeing come to fruition in Kentucky, especially with all of the economic development that's been occurring there over the last few years. So the demand curve, that mid-low demand curve that we put in the recommended case, we feel really good about, Dave, in terms of data centers, in particular, again, where we're seeing 400 megawatts at the advanced stage active discussions to upsize that to a gigawatt. That's all we put in the mid-load case. So we're obviously looking at 3 gigs overall. That continues to grow quarter after quarter. So we're pretty confident with that that 1 gig we included in the middle of the case. Sure. Thanks. Good morning, Jeremy. Yes. Look, I think the relationship is incredibly constructive. As you said, we've always operated under a constructive regulatory construct. In Kentucky, I think part of that is because our team is thoughtful. Their analysis is deep. It's well supported with -- conclusions or our recommendations are well supported with the analysis and the depth and breadth of that analysis. As you know, I think the commission uses our operations as a model in the state when they're dealing with some others. So generally, it's been quite positive. We've met with the new commission. Nothing coming out of that that discussion would lead me to believe that, relationship would be anything different with this new commission moving forward. So we're feeling good. Obviously, the commissions have full staff now with the three commissioners. Angie Hatton, who was the Vice Chair is now the Chair and then John [indiscernible] just joined in September. So with that appointment, we have a full complement. And again, I would expect the constructive nature of that relationship to continue. Great. Good morning. Yes. Look, it does sound like you're trying to front run the year-end call. That's okay. Joe, do you want to talk about that? Thanks Durgesh. Good morning Paul. Yes. Thanks, Paul. So, we did submit a number of projects to resolve the issues that were identified in the most recent window. We should know what projects, if any, are selected from that window in the December, January time frame. And of course, we'll be able to reflect those in our updated plan on the year-end call. But look, I would say regardless of what is selected in this window, we continue to believe that there will be significant transmission opportunities in Pennsylvania for the foreseeable future. And that's really stemming from the strong economic development, including the data center load that we're seeing in just the resource needs in the region. But I think you're aware, but if not, the vast, vast majority of our transmission spend is not derived from these RTEP open windows. So we really view these as incremental opportunities for us, not baked into our capital planning for transmission. Sure. Yes, sure. So, all of that will go into our filing of the CPCN. So, the IRP is not -- it's not a rate case. It's not a filing where we're requesting rate adjustments or anything like that. So, we will include and look at all of that as we're contemplating what we filed in CPCN in the first quarter. We do have the coal plants retiring and continuing to depreciate, which provides bill headroom there. Obviously, RARR [ph] which is the first time we're using that, which is that retired asset recovery mechanism in Kentucky that takes the net book value at the date of retirement and then spreads it out over a future 10-year period. So, any retirements associated with this plan would likely use that mechanism, which, again, reduces customer bills. So overall, when we look at our rate case timing and strategies, we're always thinking about affordability and making sure that we balance our ability to get these very critical investments approved, but at the same time, making sure that we're keeping bill impacts within the inflationary amounts as best we can, and I don't think we'll have an issue of being able to do that as we implement the CPCN standing on the IRP. Yes. So no concerns on getting a battery installed in 2028, I think really what you're highlighting is the reason why the next CCGT would not be able to go in service until 2030 and then the one after that in 2031. So obviously, we used to be able to get combined cycle plants done in a 3-ish time period. It's now 5% [ph]. That's really due to supply chain constraints. To your point, not just on the turbines themselves, but with the EPC contractors and getting enough folks to do all this work, so that is exactly in that driving that 2030-'31 time frame. Yes, absolutely, 100%. So first of all, I would say that the duplicate projects, we don't see any duplicates in the 8 gigs. All of those, we think, again, those are in advanced stages. We think those are very likely to come to fruition. The duplicate is in the 39 total interest that we have. We do think there could be some of those that are duplicated. But I think the 8 gigs, we're feeling good about as those progress. And to your point, the more -- especially when you're thinking about all the points that you just made, where we are in PJM, where we are with generation supply, but even just how the formula rate works and being in an RTO, the more generation you add that actually -- or the more load you have, especially at these levels, it ends up bringing down kind of the average cost per gigawatt of load for the data centers. So to your exact point, the more you build, the cheaper it becomes on a per unit basis over time. And so I 100% agree with you, and that's why we're making sure that we can support this and we feel very good with our ability to connect this, and it's really on the generation side, which you know we've been active on that side within PJM to make sure outside of PA and even within PA, we're continuing to build generation. But on the transmission side, we feel very comfortable with our ability to not only connect the 8 gigs, but to continue to connect beyond that. That's exactly correct. Yes. Thanks, Angie. Hey, good morning, Dave. Yeah. Well, I do think the PUC will have an active role in administering any legislation that could ultimately get approved there. So I think the PUC engaging in this topic to understand the nuances of it, the magnitude of it and then potentially how they may have to alter their internal procedures, et cetera, to potentially administer some law, I think, is really constructive. So again, there's no law on the books that we're responding to or anything like that, but I think the commission is preparing accordingly in the event something happens there, so that they can really do their part. Again, I would expect the commission will have a significant role in administering whatever this legislation could look like. Thank you. Thanks, Gregg. Great. Thanks so much to everybody for joining us today. Really looking forward to seeing many of you at EEI in the not-too-distant future, so we will see you then. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to slide 9. PPL's third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.29 per share compared to $0.31 per share in Q3 2023. We recorded special items of $0.13 per share during the third quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, third quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.42 per share, a decrease of $0.01 per share compared to Q3 2023. Returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes primarily due to favorable weather in Kentucky were more than offset by higher operating and financing costs quarter-over-quarter. For Q3 2024, we estimate that weather was about $0.01 favorable compared to normal conditions with cooling degree days up about 13% in our Kentucky territories over the quarter. Turning to full year. Through the first nine months of 2024, our GAAP earnings are now at $0.96 per share, compared to $0.85 per share through the same period last year. Adjusting for special items recorded through the third quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $1.34 per share for the first nine months of 2024. This represents an improvement of $0.14 per share, compared to the same period a year ago, which puts us in great shape heading into the fourth quarter to achieve our financial targets for 2024. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the third quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results were flat compared to the third quarter of 2023. Kentucky's results were driven by higher sales volumes due to the favorable weather, offset by an adjustment to environmental cost recovery revenues that was recognized during the quarter. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was driven by higher operating costs in several areas, including higher storm costs, increased vegetation management and an increase in uncollectibles. These higher operating costs were partially offset by higher transmission revenues. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by a favorable adjustment to property taxes. And finally, results at Corporate and Other decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher interest expense due to an increase in long-term debt. In Q3, we were opportunistic amidst increased market volatility and issued $750 million of senior notes at PPL Capital funding at a rate of 5.25% that mature in 2034. We saw significant demand for the deal, which we believe is attributable to PPL's excellent credit position with one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. With another solid quarter behind us, we're on track to deliver on our financial targets for our shareowners. We expect to exceed the midpoint of our original 2024 ongoing earnings forecast as reflected in our updated forecast range of $1.67 to $1.73 per share with a midpoint of $1.70 per share, and we remain extremely well positioned for continued long-term growth. As Vince outlined, we see an improving fundamental backdrop that we believe will require significant capital investments to advance our Utility of the Future strategy that can satisfy our customers' evolving needs and ensure we can continue to deliver safe and reliable service. We strategically positioned PPL with the financial flexibility needed to support these critical investments while continuing to deliver on our earnings growth targets, but we're as excited as we've ever been for the prospects of PPL. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince. Sure. Thanks for the question, Durgesh. Yes. So I mean, look, there's numerous factors that go into determining our financing needs, and we are going through the business planning process now and evaluating those factors, including additional capital needs. And those needs are beyond what would be in the next CPCN filing. We're seeing additional needs for things like grid modernization, grid resiliency given the more severe and frequent storms that we're seeing across all of our territories, digital transformation, transmission to support data centers and other load growth. And we've clearly been on a trend of identifying additional capital spend, which is driving higher rate base growth and I think, in fact, each year since we've had the strategic repositioning, our rate base growth has increased by about 100 basis points in each iteration of the plan. And I certainly expect that trend to continue in our next update. So, we'll evaluate our financing needs in context of that broader plan update and provide you our expectations on the year-end call. But we are in great shape given our excellent credit position, and we have flexibility to develop a plan that maximizes value for our shareowners. And we continue to feel really good about our ability to achieve our earnings growth targets even with the additional capital needs that we expect in this next update. Yes, I mean all of those things go into our consideration for our financing needs and the overall plan. But I think where we've seen that occur is in -- with companies that have had not the strength of a balance sheet that we have. So that's not our intention at this time. Great. Thank you. Yes, hi, David, it's Joe Bergstein. Yes, I think as I said earlier, we're going through the business plan process now. We'll give a full update on all of this -- on the year-end call. But as you think about our earned growth now and the drivers of that, it's driven by a mix of energy efficiencies and rate base growth. And clearly, we've been talking about that transitioning to the more traditional rate base growth driven earnings growth profile. And I think we're -- we've been seeing that through the -- since the repositioning with each of the play an updates as I've indicated, and I expect that trend to continue where we'll be -- earnings growth will be driven by rate base growth as we move forward. And I think that's what you'll clearly see that in the next iteration of plan. Yeah, I think high level, that's correct. We'll continue on the O&M efficiency strategy, but we'll need to make capital investments to achieve those O&M savings. Yeah. Thanks, Gregg. It's Joe. So well, I would say based on our current plan, which again, we're in the process of updating, we would have a rate case in Kentucky in first half of next year at the at the earliest. We have a stay-out provision from the last rate case that ends at the end of June of next year. So rate case potentially likely after that. In Rhode Island, it's likely the fourth quarter of 2025. Again, there, we had an agreement as part of the acquisition that we would not file a rate case until we were off of the TSAs for 12 months, and we did complete the TSAs in September. So that's why it looks like the fourth quarter of next year. And then in Pennsylvania, based on the current plan that's 2026 at the earliest, but we'll assess the timing of all -- of these as we're going through the business plan update and give you an update on the year-end call."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Ludwig: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the PPL Corporation conference call on second quarter 2024 financial results. We provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer. And we'll conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings on this call. Reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures please refer to the appendix. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from our second quarter performance on Slide 4. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.26 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.38 per share. Backed by another strong quarter, today, we reaffirmed our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.63 to $1.75 per share, and expect to achieve at least the midpoint of our forecast range. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress in delivering on our 2024 priorities. We're on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable, and cleaner energy future for our customers. We're on pace to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in the coming weeks and to complete what has so far been a seamless integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL. Lastly, we expect to achieve our annual O&M savings target of $120 million to $130 million this year, which is compared to our 2021 baseline O&M. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth to at least 2027. We remain as focused as ever on executing our capital plan, which includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027. And across PPL, we continue to drive efficiencies through our Utility of the Future strategy, keeping us on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026, again, compared to our 2021 baseline. Moving to Slide 5, I want to reiterate our Utility of the Future strategy, which in a nutshell is to deliver a net zero energy system by 2050, but one that continues to be reliable and affordable for our customers. The decarbonization strategy here in the U.S. and even globally, is to electrify as much of the economy as we can and generate the needed electricity with no or low carbon solutions. This will significantly increase the demand for electricity, currently estimated at 2 to 3 times our current levels. But it also requires the electricity grid to be significantly more reliable and resilient than it is today. Our Utility of the Future strategy addresses this challenge head on across multiple focus areas. First, we will improve the reliability and resiliency of our oil and gas networks through updated design criteria and system hardening to better protect against more frequent and severe storms; through automation, AI and smart grid technology that offers self-healing grid capabilities; through grid-enhancing technologies that help us extract the most from existing infrastructure; and through robust and ever-evolving cybersecurity that protects against present and future threats. At the same time, we will continue to advance the clean energy transition affordably and reliably. We'll achieve this by transitioning to a reliable, affordable and cleaner energy mix, one that includes an important role for dispatchable natural gas as we retire aging coal-fired duration. We'll do it by positioning the grid to connecting renewables, including behind-the-meter resources. And we'll do it by continuing to lead, partner and invest in R&D to accelerate the commercialization of low-carbon technologies needed to achieve net zero, technologies such as advanced nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen and long duration energy storage. This includes the recent partnerships we've made with the Department of Energy to explore the feasibility of coal to nuclear transitions at some of our power plant sites in Kentucky, and a leading carbon capture R&D project at our Cane Run combined cycle gas plant. Our Utility of the Future strategy also includes driving sustainable efficiencies to keep energy affordable for our customers as we invest in the clean energy transition. For every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can invest about $8 in capital without impacting our customers' bills. This is why becoming more efficient is such an important part of our strategy and helps to keep the transition more affordable for our customers. We are also focused on using AI and other advanced technologies more broadly, which will drive further efficiencies and improved results. We are starting to see firsthand the power of AI and how transformational this technology will be to our business. This includes balancing the grid in peak shaving, empowering our customers and enhancing their experience with our utilities, and further improving reliability while lowering our costs. The applications of AI technology are tremendous for our industry and we are extremely focused to unlock that potential to deliver real value. And finally, we'll continue to engage and lead discussions with a wide range of stakeholders to strengthen resource adequacy in the regions we serve, specifically including markets like PJM, which is even more critical following the capacity auction results that were just released this week. With increasing demand and tight supply, we need to do everything we can to protect our customers from such price volatility, including investing further in transmission upgrades to alleviate constrained zones, incorporating additional grid enhancing technologies to get as much as we can from existing lines, and advocating for legislative changes in Pennsylvania that would drive needed generation development, including authority that would support regulated utility investments in new generation. Collectively, these actions will not only maintain reliability, but also power economic development, while at the same time, support data center growth and expansion, which we consider critical to American competitiveness and national security. This is our Utility of the Future playbook to not only address the challenges of delivering a clean energy future that is affordable and reliable but to enable us to thrive and grow in that ever-changing energy landscape. Moving to Slide 6 and a deeper dive on our support for data centers. Starting with Pennsylvania, we truly believe our Pennsylvania service territory is uniquely positioned to service large-scale data center connections. First, we've invested $6.5 billion over the last decade in our transmission network, while leveraging advanced dynamic line rating technology, which together has improved the reliability of the network to top decile performance nationwide. Our advanced transmission network as well of connecting the current data center demand in our queue and we are confident we can support even further demand should it materialize. This means we can respond very quickly to develop our interconnection requests. Our team responds within six weeks. As a result, we now have a total of over 17 gigawatts of interconnection requests in Pennsylvania and new requests continue to come in each month. While it is likely that some of these requests are duplicative due to developers assessing multiple sites at the same time, we have nearly 5 gigawatts of potential data center demand in advanced stages of planning, up from the 3 gigawatts we discussed during our first quarter update in May. These projects all have signed agreements with developers, are in various stages of PJM's review process with some having already completed that review, and costs being incurred by PPL are reimbursable by the developers if they do not move forward with the projects. On the financial impact of data centers, the primary upside is in the form of additional returns on transmission investments through FERC formula rates. We estimate that the 5 gigawatts of potential demand in the advanced stages represents incremental PPL capital needs of $400 million to $450 million. And because we operate in PJM in Pennsylvania, this data center development will reduce net transmission costs for our existing retail customers. We estimate for every 1 gigawatt of data center demand that's connected to the grid, our residential customers would save about 10% on the transmission portion of their bill. For the average residential customer, that would represent about $3 a month in savings. For the 5 gigawatts in advanced stages of development, that would represent about $15 a month in savings for the average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours a month of electricity. Turning to Kentucky, our service territory there is better suited for midsized data centers as we also have an abundance of land and water, have lower energy prices than much of the U.S., and provide for tax incentives in certain counties that we serve. We are also confident we can make the needed transmission and generation investments required to support continued data center and industrial growth in the Commonwealth. We continue to work with data center developers in our LG&E and KU service territories with active requests totaling more than 2 gigawatts in the 2027 to 2033 timeframe, with about 350 megawatts in advanced stages. As in Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades in Kentucky would be additive to our capital plan, although the more significant capital investments in Kentucky would arise from any incremental generation investments. Once our new Mill Creek 5 combined Saskatchewan plant is operational in 2027, we estimate to have approximately 400 to 500 megawatts of generation capacity available to support further load growth, while maintaining our prudent reserve margins. With Kentucky coming off the best four-year period of economic growth in the state history, on top of this potential new data center demand, we continue to actively monitor our capacity needs to maintain a safe and reliable network for customers. Should new generation become necessary to serve higher electricity demand, we can use Mill Creek Unit 5 as a reference for pricing on potential new baseload generation. That unit, which was approved by the KPSC last year, has an expected cost of $1 billion. The updated integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the KPSC in October, will guide any further generation needs. Keep in mind, there are many factors that go into our generation planning and reserve margin analysis. We will fresh that analysis this fall and will include updated load projections and related supply needs. As we think about possibly needing to build a second combined cycle gas plant to meet that load growth, it's important to note that we still have a spot in the queue for a second gas turbine from our prior solicitation. It is important to highlight that our rate designs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky protect our customers from undue burdens related to data center connections. In both jurisdictions, the data centers are under tariffs that will benefit our non-data center customer rates. Bottom-line, as I shared last quarter, we're ready and eager to support prospective data centers and we are well-positioned to serve their needs. And the good news is that our customers, shareowners, and the states which we serve all benefit from this development. Moving to Slide 7 and several key operational and regulatory updates. On July 11th, the Pennsylvania PUC approved PPL Electric Utilities' request to modify its current long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP. The decision grant permission to classify approximately $200 million of reliability investments through 2027 as capital eligible for recovery through the DSIC or the distribution system improvement charge. While the PUC denied our request to classify $84 million of planned investments in predictive failure technology as being DSIC eligible, the PUC viewed our predictive failure project favorably, and indicated PPL Electric may seek recovery of these project costs in a future base rate case. Overall, the approved modification to our LTIP represents a positive outcome that supports our continued investments to repair and replace aging infrastructure and strengthen grid reliability. Changes to the plant will be impacted during the current period, which extends through December 31st, 2027. Also in Pennsylvania, our DSIC waiver petition continues to proceed through the process as expected. In June, an ALJ was assigned and a procedural schedule was created, which we have provided in the appendix. Based on that schedule, we continue to expect the proceeding to conclude later this year with a decision in early 2025. Shifting to Kentucky. We recently kicked off construction of our planned 650-megawatt Mill Creek Unit 5 combined cycle natural gas plant following several months of prep work. The new unit is part of more than $2 billion in planned generation investments over several years to economically replace 600 megawatts of aging coal generation with a reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy mix. In addition, all long lead-time equipment deliveries remain on schedule. Overall, we're on track to complete construction and begin commercial operation of the unit in 2027. We will earn AFUDC on this capital project until it goes into commercial operations. In addition, we secured a site compatibility certificate from the KPSC in July for a planned 120-megawatt solar facility to be built in Mercer County, Kentucky. The approval helps pave the way for final site design and construction of the new facility, which we expect to begin commercial operation in 2026. Finally, just this week, we successfully completed another labor contract negotiation. This latest agreement covers about 60 employees in Kentucky and represents the fifth successful union negotiation over the last year, representing over 50% of our union workforce. We look forward to continued success in this area for years to come, balancing the needs of our employees and customers. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update.\nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. PPL's second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share compared to $0.15 per share in Q2 2023. We recorded special items of $0.12 per share during the second quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.38 per share, an improvement of $0.09 per share compared to Q2 2023. Primary drivers of this increase where returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes, primarily due to the return to more normal weather conditions. In total, we estimate that weather was about $0.04 favorable compared to the prior year and about $0.01 favorable to normal conditions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily due to higher debt balances with the issuances at PPL Electric, Rhode Island Energy earlier this year, which were executed at attractive rates favorable to our forecast. And we'll continue to monitor the markets and leverage our excellent credit position to be opportunistic and efficiently finance our capital plans. Our Q2 performance puts PPL's GAAP earnings at $0.67 per share year-to-date through June 30th compared to $0.54 per share through the same period last year. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.92 per share for the first half of 2024, an improvement of $0.15 per share compared to the first half of 2023. We estimate that weather has been $0.07 favorable compared to the first six months of 2023, while tracking slightly below normal conditions year-to-date in 2024. The full year-to-date ongoing earnings walk by segment is included in the appendix. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the second quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2023. The improvement in Kentucky's results was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to the return to normal weather and lower operating costs. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.05 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was driven by higher transmission revenues and higher sales volumes due to a combination of a return to normal weather and increased usage per customer. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher distribution revenue from capital investments, higher transmission revenue, and higher interest income, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher property taxes. Finally, results at corporate and other decreased by $0.02 per share compared to the prior period, primarily due to higher interest expense. With another strong quarter behind us, we're on track to achieve at least the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast of $1.69 per share. I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance as we continue to execute our plan and our Utility of the Future strategy. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince.\nVince Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, we continued our strong track record of execution in the second quarter, further strengthening PPL's investment thesis. We are implementing our Utility of the Future strategy necessary to deliver a clean energy future affordably and reliably. We are securing constructive outcomes in key regulatory proceedings. We're achieving strong financial results, which positions us to deliver at least the midpoint of our targeted EPS growth this year and to grow earnings and dividends by 6% to 8% through at least 2027. We're maintaining one of the premier balance sheets in our sector that supports the growing investment needs across our jurisdictions. We're advancing the economic transition of our generation fleet in Kentucky, and we're continuing to power economic development that strengthens our communities, including the support of data center expansion. For all, we've made significant progress on our plans through the first half of the year. We're eager to build on this momentum in the back half of 2024 and beyond. And we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to share owners, customers and the communities we serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning. Good morning Vince. Vince, just trying to get a sense on the transmission side. Looking at 400 to 450 incremental for this update. We've also seen a blowout print capacity auction potentially foreshadowing more RTEP work. What does all this start to add up as we look at your $725 million placeholder for 2027, how should we think about the timing of the shape of that spend as we update our models for 2028 and beyond versus that 2027 placeholder you have in plan? Thanks.\nVince Sorgi: Yes, Shar. I think what you're bringing up is a good point in terms of what is capacity auction signifying, right? And clearly, I think it's showing that there's a clear signal that we do generation and transmission investments needed in PJM. In terms of ability to invest in transmission, I think that's in a few areas. Obviously, there were the two zones that broke out above the RTO. Clearly, I think there's opportunity for additional transmission solutions going into there. So, I think we could probably expect there to be an open window to try to resolve some of that. As you know, in the past, we've been successful in winning some projects going down into the Maryland, Virginia area. So, it could be additional opportunity there in addition to just investments in our own area. I would say that from a broader strategic perspective, I think those auction results also would reinforce our strategy in working with the state of Pennsylvania and the other EDCs in the state to help resolve the resource adequacy concerns that many of us have been talking about for a while now, in particular, in PJM. And so we're not going to just sit back and wait for this issue to resolve itself. We have an obligation to serve and do everything that we can for our customers, whether it's these additional transmission investments, I think we can do additional grid-enhancing technologies on the existing grid and then continuing to advocate for legislative change. So, we'll continue to push that agenda to ultimately lower the price of electricity for our customers and reduce the volatility.\nShar Pourreza: And Vince, just on -- it's a good segue right to my follow-up. But just on the broader resource question to BR. A lot of your wires peers have commented on it this week you just did. We've had -- in the past, we've had similar attempts on this kind of reregulation of certain amount of generation over 13 years ago, right, in New Jersey and Maryland with the LCAP and MCAP program, which ultimately got struck down by the courts, it was a little bit more on the capacity side versus energy. But I guess what's different focusing on potential generation request by the wireless companies? Where are the conversations at with policymakers? Are they waiting for the IP piece to step up and build? What's your trigger point? Should we be watching a legislative window next year, I guess, just elaborate a little bit on some of the dialogue you guys are having?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. Well, look, I think the biggest difference, Shar, is what's in the queue, right? And what we right now is significant amounts of dispatchable generation being retired with very little dispatchable generation coming on. And so I think that's the big -- the big issue is not so much the energy play. It's the capacity play and having -- making sure that we have enough capacity to serve 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365. So, that's really the big difference, I would say, from what we're seeing now. And so what's being left in the market is creating real concerns around resource adequacy, I think there's a few signposts that we're certainly watching to determine what the long-term impact of this capacity option will be in terms of our customer bills, but also just on resource adequacy, we want to see what the auction results are for the 2026, 2027 planning year, which will happen in December. Same thing for the 2027, 2028 planning here. That will occur next June. I want to see if there's any new dispatchable generation entering the queue between now and December, right? We suspect that the IPPs will want to see more than just this one data point before they're committing to building new dispatchable gen like natural gas. So, we'll be keeping an eye on that. So, there's a few things that we'll be looking at. This, of course, is one data point, but I think it clearly supports our strategy, which is we sure we keep resource adequacy front and center. We think the states are going to have to play an active role in that. Unfortunately, I think Pennsylvania is taking this seriously, and we look forward to continuing to work with all the stakeholders in the state to see what we can do to show this up.\nShar Pourreza: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the additional color here. Congrats on the results and seriously, we'll see you soon.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Shar.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Morning Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning Vince. Thank you for taking my questions. Hey, I just want to continue the discussion on the PJM auction results. You mentioned that IPPs probably want another signal before they can commit capital here. This is a pretty dramatic signal in terms of price increases. One of the things we're consistently getting asked from investors is what does it do to utility builds? Your peers kind of talked about double-digit increases in some of their services. I know this is not 9 times translates into that large a bill increase, but just maybe can you discuss that a bit what does this mean for customer bills?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, of course. So, I would say for the near-term impact for customer bills, and this of course, assumes all else equal, right, which never is the case. But all else equal, we would estimate that these higher prices would impact the generation portion of the bill for an average customer by about $10 to $15 per month. That represents roughly 5% to 10% of the total bill. We would expect that to begin in 2025 as our suppliers start to reflect these higher prices in their solicitation bids. I did talk in our prepared remarks, fortunately, in addition to the other actions that I just talked about with Shar, that we're taking on this issue. We are seeing that substantial data center load. And if we just stick with that 5 gigs in advanced stages, right, that would reduce our customer bills over time by a similar amount that we're talking as a result of the capacity price increases once that demand all comes online. So, lots of moving parts on here. Obviously, the capacity prices will have a near-term increase impact and then we'll look to mitigate that over time with various actions, including the data center look coming online.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's very helpful. I appreciate the detail there. Then just switching gears on the balance sheet. Just thinking about the $400 million to $450 million you mentioned and other opportunities across the different states. How should we think about your balance sheet capacity? What CapEx could be done with debt? And at what point you might consider equity as we think about you rolling forward your plan here into 2029 now?\nJoe Bergstein: Sure. Hi Durgesh, it's Joe. So, look, I'd just say that our balance sheet is in really good shape, and we expect to be within the FFO to debt range of 16% to 18% through the planning horizon. Capital is just one factor that goes into our financing needs, and we'll work that through as we update our business plan. But obviously, there's other things that drive those financing needs to determine what will ultimately do, interest rates, inflation, our efficiency strategy certainly plays a role in that and then rate case outcome. So, as we go through the plan, and incorporate all of these factors, including potential additions for data centers and other opportunities, we'll take that into -- but again, our balance sheet is in really good shape.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you. Thank you, both. Appreciate the time.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Morning Dave.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey good morning. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Looking ahead to the Kentucky IRP in October. Just curious, does it look likely at this point that you'll need new generation as you're crafting that before you file it?\nVince Sorgi: Well, I certainly don't want to get in front of that process that right, it's a very extensive process that we go through when we update the IRP. We are required to update that in October with the commission. The reason I say that, Dave, is, obviously, we have to do a full load forecast update, right? So, we'll look at what's going on with the industrial growth, what's going on with data centers, just general customer -- new customer additions and what we're seeing from a relatively useful customer perspective. We also have to take into account energy efficiency programs, distributed energy resources, penetration, of course, electric vehicles are starting to come in. So, we will do a comprehensive load forecast with multiple scenarios around that forecast and that ultimately feed into how we believe we will need to deal with that from a migration supply perspective, which could include a combination of dispatchable resources to ensure we have capacity there, which would be something like another combined cycle natural gas plant, but it could also entail additional solar or renewable resources, batteries similar to what we got approved last year. So, I don't want to get in front of what that result will be, but suffice it to say, we'll go through that full analysis that we'll have a pretty good sense when we file that what our generation needs. And then if it shows the need for incremental generation, we would follow that up shortly thereafter with the CPCN to request approval for that.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes, understood. That makes sense. I was also curious, do you have a view on how long -- just thinking about the PJM market, how tight that market has gotten here. How long does this does it take to build a new gas plant in PJM realistically? Like when could we actually see a supply response kind of from anybody as we look at supporting the supply/demand tightness?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, you're not going to love this answer, but it depends, right? Are we talking peakers? Are we talking combined cycle? Do you own turbines -- do you have to get in the queue? Theoretically, if you own turbines and we're talking peakers, and you've done some site work probably 18 months, 18 to 24 months on the short end. If you're starting from scratch and you want to go combined cycle, it's probably four to five years.\nDavid Arcaro: Yes, got it. That makes sense. Tough problem to solve, but depending on which can you go. Maybe one last question from me. You've highlighted the TMO in the slides. And so looking at the O&M opportunities, I was wondering, have you taken a look at kind of beyond the 2026 targets? What are the -- what's the opportunity set here? Can you continue beyond your existing targets on O&M cost reductions?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, Dave, it's Joe. Certainly, beyond 2026, we continue to see opportunities. Vince mentioned, AI and some of the use cases that we're seeing that we think can drive longer-term O&M efficiency opportunities. Clearly, we're focused on achieving the $175 million that we've laid out, which we're in good -- making good progress on and we'll achieve that we'll continue to look for opportunities beyond that time frame. But certainly, there will be opportunities to get more efficient.\nDavid Arcaro: Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate the color.\nVince Sorgi: Thanks Dave.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning tea. Thank you guys for the time. Nice job you guys. So, a lot has been said here, but let me pivot a little bit in a different direction here on this conversation on data centers. And that's the heuristic I think you provided about like 1 gigawatt reducing the bill by like $3 a month. How do you think about that scaling here, right? Because you talked about more than 1 gigawatt of data center. Obviously, I think that there's an element of time here of when you realize those cost savings. But can you speak to that again, you throw out like a 5-gigawatt potential, for instance, here of late. Like not going to reduce emission costs that sizable linearly.\nVince Sorgi: What we're seeing with the current 5 gigs is that, that starts in 2026, we would expect to be at our first gig in 2027 and then probably added 1 gig each year thereafter.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And what does that mean for -- as you think about like build cost reductions through that, right, using that heuristic of that $3 a month. Do you think about -- did it see compounding benefits every year?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, it's about $3 a month per gigawatt. So, by the time we get the full 5 gigawatts, it would be about $15 a month in lower bills for the per residential customers.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wow. Okay, that's pretty impressive. And then separately here, just in terms of -- you talked about this predictive failure technology, not being DSIC eligible. Can you talk about what that does for rate case timing, if at all? Or can you talk about Pennsylvania at large on the rate case side, I suppose there are other factors there as well?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, sure. I mean in general, I mean, $84 million isn't going to necessarily impact our rate case timing, Julian. But -- so we'll look to continue to deploy that technology and seek recovery in our next base rate case. Joe, you can talk about timing on that?\nJoe Bergstein: Yes, I think at this point, the earliest we would see a rate case in Pennsylvania would be 2026 and that would be at the earliest, we may be able to go beyond that timeframe. Again, it's point, he's right $84 million isn't going to drive that decision, but we'll deploy it, and we'll seek recovery of that in the next rate case whenever it may be.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then related here, your thoughts on -- just going back to that, I think you said October filing on the next IRP here. Just to the extent to which that you are able to move swiftly on that second combined cycle here, presumably as a piece of that. I mean how front-end loaded versus longer-dated could some of these opportunities prove themselves?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So, near-term transmission upgrades, those will go in line with the requests. Just to give you -- again, we're in a $10 million to $75 million per project range in Kentucky, just given the size of the projects down there just to give you a sense for the 350 megawatts that are in more advanced stages in Kentucky, that's just under $30 million of incremental capital there on the transmission side. So, those will be done in concert with the data center demand coming on. In terms of the generation, any large-scale generation like would not come online until around 2030. That's the indication we've gotten from the commission, when we talk to EPC contractors, when we look at when we can get the turbines, that's probably where we're talking in kind of the 2030 timeframe. So, obviously, the few years prior to that is when we'll be spending the capital.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, probably, 2028 to 2030 there. All right. Cool. Excellent. Thank you guys. Appreciate it very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nVince Sorgi: Hello Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Hey everybody. For the 5 gigawatt opportunity, what's the timetable for go, no-go decisions for these potential customers? Is there any cadence or color you could provide around how that could play out?\nVince Sorgi: Yes. So look, we're making good progress with the developers on all of those. We're working through the PJM planning process as well as the PUC processes, all of that is progressing well. I would say probably no change, Ryan, from what we talked about on the Q1 call. We still expect that any formal announcements would come kind of at the end of the year, beginning of next year. The data center companies are going to want to make sure we get through those full processes before they're announcing. So we would expect that to be really around the end of the year, beginning of next year.\nRyan Levine: The end-of-year decision for the initial 3 gigawatts or to the entire 5?\nVince Sorgi: That's all 5.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then in terms of the Pennsylvania CapEx associated with that, I appreciate the color provided. But in terms of scaling beyond the 5, is there any key milestones or amounts that you'd have to achieve to be able to have maybe a bigger step up on a per megawatt basis from an investment standpoint?\nVince Sorgi: I mean, again, that's really very project specific. So, we'll update this quarterly so you have a sense of how we're progressing on overall data center demand in our jurisdictions, how much is in the queue, how much is in advanced stages. We'll try to provide updated CapEx estimates as we go along. But it'd be hard to again, we're talking $50 million to $150 million. So, that's a $100 million range depending on the project. So, we'll keep that disclosure updated as we go.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then one last one for me. In terms of the headquarters in Pennsylvania, is there any practical implications from headcount or cost outlook given the real estate sale?\nVince Sorgi: No, I mean this was really -- the decision to sell the building was a kind of post-COVID had way too much real estate from what we needed. It was underutilized. And so nothing to do with headcount.\nRyan Levine: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey good morning team. Hope summer treating you well.\nVince Sorgi: Likewise.\nAnthony Crowdell: Range's schedule is out, but we'll keep it just to the call here. I'm just wondering, Vince, you talked about some of the transmission opportunities and the infrastructure investment associated with this higher capacity price. If you -- and then we're going to look at December to see what the print is there. I mean, do you think higher capacity prices are good for PPL given the potential added investment?\nVince Sorgi: Well, look, I think there's a number of things we're focused on, Anthony, right? There's resource adequacy overall in the market, in particular, in PJM. And so if those higher prices incentivize new generation and sure resource adequacy, that's a good thing, for all of us in PJM. We talked about the higher cost that will ultimately bear for our customers, which obviously is not great for our customers, but we're looking at all alternatives to see how we can bring that generation to bear in the most lease cost way, as you know. So, there are some puts and there are some takes, I would say, with that print.\nAnthony Crowdell: Got it. And then just following up, and I apologize if you just keep popping on the PJM, and I'm just not that familiar with it. For your customers in Pennsylvania that maybe don't shop that maybe the utility procures the energy. Is there a hedging strategy you guys pursue to mitigate any energy price volatility for customers?\nVince Sorgi: Yes, that's why the range is $10 to $15. So, we have in the early part of 2025 where we've already procured that power. It wouldn't have as big of an impact as the back half when we're procuring additional power and those prices might be reflected in what we're buying. So, the next solicitation is October, 4th quarter of this year. So, we're suspecting that those prices will make its way into that solicitation.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Looking forward to seeing you guys next week.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for any closing remarks.\nVince Sorgi: Great. Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. We will be in New York next week and hopefully, we'll get to see as many of you as we can then. So, thanks again for joining.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vince Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy and good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from our second quarter performance on Slide 4. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.26 per share. Adjusting for special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.38 per share. Backed by another strong quarter, today, we reaffirmed our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.63 to $1.75 per share, and expect to achieve at least the midpoint of our forecast range. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress in delivering on our 2024 priorities. We're on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to advance a reliable, resilient, affordable, and cleaner energy future for our customers. We're on pace to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid in the coming weeks and to complete what has so far been a seamless integration of Rhode Island Energy into PPL. Lastly, we expect to achieve our annual O&M savings target of $120 million to $130 million this year, which is compared to our 2021 baseline O&M. Looking ahead, we're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth to at least 2027. We remain as focused as ever on executing our capital plan, which includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027. And across PPL, we continue to drive efficiencies through our Utility of the Future strategy, keeping us on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026, again, compared to our 2021 baseline. Moving to Slide 5, I want to reiterate our Utility of the Future strategy, which in a nutshell is to deliver a net zero energy system by 2050, but one that continues to be reliable and affordable for our customers. The decarbonization strategy here in the U.S. and even globally, is to electrify as much of the economy as we can and generate the needed electricity with no or low carbon solutions. This will significantly increase the demand for electricity, currently estimated at 2 to 3 times our current levels. But it also requires the electricity grid to be significantly more reliable and resilient than it is today. Our Utility of the Future strategy addresses this challenge head on across multiple focus areas. First, we will improve the reliability and resiliency of our oil and gas networks through updated design criteria and system hardening to better protect against more frequent and severe storms; through automation, AI and smart grid technology that offers self-healing grid capabilities; through grid-enhancing technologies that help us extract the most from existing infrastructure; and through robust and ever-evolving cybersecurity that protects against present and future threats. At the same time, we will continue to advance the clean energy transition affordably and reliably. We'll achieve this by transitioning to a reliable, affordable and cleaner energy mix, one that includes an important role for dispatchable natural gas as we retire aging coal-fired duration. We'll do it by positioning the grid to connecting renewables, including behind-the-meter resources. And we'll do it by continuing to lead, partner and invest in R&D to accelerate the commercialization of low-carbon technologies needed to achieve net zero, technologies such as advanced nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen and long duration energy storage. This includes the recent partnerships we've made with the Department of Energy to explore the feasibility of coal to nuclear transitions at some of our power plant sites in Kentucky, and a leading carbon capture R&D project at our Cane Run combined cycle gas plant. Our Utility of the Future strategy also includes driving sustainable efficiencies to keep energy affordable for our customers as we invest in the clean energy transition. For every dollar of O&M we can take out of the business, we can invest about $8 in capital without impacting our customers' bills. This is why becoming more efficient is such an important part of our strategy and helps to keep the transition more affordable for our customers. We are also focused on using AI and other advanced technologies more broadly, which will drive further efficiencies and improved results. We are starting to see firsthand the power of AI and how transformational this technology will be to our business. This includes balancing the grid in peak shaving, empowering our customers and enhancing their experience with our utilities, and further improving reliability while lowering our costs. The applications of AI technology are tremendous for our industry and we are extremely focused to unlock that potential to deliver real value. And finally, we'll continue to engage and lead discussions with a wide range of stakeholders to strengthen resource adequacy in the regions we serve, specifically including markets like PJM, which is even more critical following the capacity auction results that were just released this week. With increasing demand and tight supply, we need to do everything we can to protect our customers from such price volatility, including investing further in transmission upgrades to alleviate constrained zones, incorporating additional grid enhancing technologies to get as much as we can from existing lines, and advocating for legislative changes in Pennsylvania that would drive needed generation development, including authority that would support regulated utility investments in new generation. Collectively, these actions will not only maintain reliability, but also power economic development, while at the same time, support data center growth and expansion, which we consider critical to American competitiveness and national security. This is our Utility of the Future playbook to not only address the challenges of delivering a clean energy future that is affordable and reliable but to enable us to thrive and grow in that ever-changing energy landscape. Moving to Slide 6 and a deeper dive on our support for data centers. Starting with Pennsylvania, we truly believe our Pennsylvania service territory is uniquely positioned to service large-scale data center connections. First, we've invested $6.5 billion over the last decade in our transmission network, while leveraging advanced dynamic line rating technology, which together has improved the reliability of the network to top decile performance nationwide. Our advanced transmission network as well of connecting the current data center demand in our queue and we are confident we can support even further demand should it materialize. This means we can respond very quickly to develop our interconnection requests. Our team responds within six weeks. As a result, we now have a total of over 17 gigawatts of interconnection requests in Pennsylvania and new requests continue to come in each month. While it is likely that some of these requests are duplicative due to developers assessing multiple sites at the same time, we have nearly 5 gigawatts of potential data center demand in advanced stages of planning, up from the 3 gigawatts we discussed during our first quarter update in May. These projects all have signed agreements with developers, are in various stages of PJM's review process with some having already completed that review, and costs being incurred by PPL are reimbursable by the developers if they do not move forward with the projects. On the financial impact of data centers, the primary upside is in the form of additional returns on transmission investments through FERC formula rates. We estimate that the 5 gigawatts of potential demand in the advanced stages represents incremental PPL capital needs of $400 million to $450 million. And because we operate in PJM in Pennsylvania, this data center development will reduce net transmission costs for our existing retail customers. We estimate for every 1 gigawatt of data center demand that's connected to the grid, our residential customers would save about 10% on the transmission portion of their bill. For the average residential customer, that would represent about $3 a month in savings. For the 5 gigawatts in advanced stages of development, that would represent about $15 a month in savings for the average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours a month of electricity. Turning to Kentucky, our service territory there is better suited for midsized data centers as we also have an abundance of land and water, have lower energy prices than much of the U.S., and provide for tax incentives in certain counties that we serve. We are also confident we can make the needed transmission and generation investments required to support continued data center and industrial growth in the Commonwealth. We continue to work with data center developers in our LG&E and KU service territories with active requests totaling more than 2 gigawatts in the 2027 to 2033 timeframe, with about 350 megawatts in advanced stages. As in Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades in Kentucky would be additive to our capital plan, although the more significant capital investments in Kentucky would arise from any incremental generation investments. Once our new Mill Creek 5 combined Saskatchewan plant is operational in 2027, we estimate to have approximately 400 to 500 megawatts of generation capacity available to support further load growth, while maintaining our prudent reserve margins. With Kentucky coming off the best four-year period of economic growth in the state history, on top of this potential new data center demand, we continue to actively monitor our capacity needs to maintain a safe and reliable network for customers. Should new generation become necessary to serve higher electricity demand, we can use Mill Creek Unit 5 as a reference for pricing on potential new baseload generation. That unit, which was approved by the KPSC last year, has an expected cost of $1 billion. The updated integrated resource plan, which will be filed with the KPSC in October, will guide any further generation needs. Keep in mind, there are many factors that go into our generation planning and reserve margin analysis. We will fresh that analysis this fall and will include updated load projections and related supply needs. As we think about possibly needing to build a second combined cycle gas plant to meet that load growth, it's important to note that we still have a spot in the queue for a second gas turbine from our prior solicitation. It is important to highlight that our rate designs in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky protect our customers from undue burdens related to data center connections. In both jurisdictions, the data centers are under tariffs that will benefit our non-data center customer rates. Bottom-line, as I shared last quarter, we're ready and eager to support prospective data centers and we are well-positioned to serve their needs. And the good news is that our customers, shareowners, and the states which we serve all benefit from this development. Moving to Slide 7 and several key operational and regulatory updates. On July 11th, the Pennsylvania PUC approved PPL Electric Utilities' request to modify its current long-term infrastructure improvement plan, or LTIP. The decision grant permission to classify approximately $200 million of reliability investments through 2027 as capital eligible for recovery through the DSIC or the distribution system improvement charge. While the PUC denied our request to classify $84 million of planned investments in predictive failure technology as being DSIC eligible, the PUC viewed our predictive failure project favorably, and indicated PPL Electric may seek recovery of these project costs in a future base rate case. Overall, the approved modification to our LTIP represents a positive outcome that supports our continued investments to repair and replace aging infrastructure and strengthen grid reliability. Changes to the plant will be impacted during the current period, which extends through December 31st, 2027. Also in Pennsylvania, our DSIC waiver petition continues to proceed through the process as expected. In June, an ALJ was assigned and a procedural schedule was created, which we have provided in the appendix. Based on that schedule, we continue to expect the proceeding to conclude later this year with a decision in early 2025. Shifting to Kentucky. We recently kicked off construction of our planned 650-megawatt Mill Creek Unit 5 combined cycle natural gas plant following several months of prep work. The new unit is part of more than $2 billion in planned generation investments over several years to economically replace 600 megawatts of aging coal generation with a reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy mix. In addition, all long lead-time equipment deliveries remain on schedule. Overall, we're on track to complete construction and begin commercial operation of the unit in 2027. We will earn AFUDC on this capital project until it goes into commercial operations. In addition, we secured a site compatibility certificate from the KPSC in July for a planned 120-megawatt solar facility to be built in Mercer County, Kentucky. The approval helps pave the way for final site design and construction of the new facility, which we expect to begin commercial operation in 2026. Finally, just this week, we successfully completed another labor contract negotiation. This latest agreement covers about 60 employees in Kentucky and represents the fifth successful union negotiation over the last year, representing over 50% of our union workforce. We look forward to continued success in this area for years to come, balancing the needs of our employees and customers. That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, we continued our strong track record of execution in the second quarter, further strengthening PPL's investment thesis. We are implementing our Utility of the Future strategy necessary to deliver a clean energy future affordably and reliably. We are securing constructive outcomes in key regulatory proceedings. We're achieving strong financial results, which positions us to deliver at least the midpoint of our targeted EPS growth this year and to grow earnings and dividends by 6% to 8% through at least 2027. We're maintaining one of the premier balance sheets in our sector that supports the growing investment needs across our jurisdictions. We're advancing the economic transition of our generation fleet in Kentucky, and we're continuing to power economic development that strengthens our communities, including the support of data center expansion. For all, we've made significant progress on our plans through the first half of the year. We're eager to build on this momentum in the back half of 2024 and beyond. And we look forward to once again delivering on our commitments to share owners, customers and the communities we serve. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, Shar. I think what you're bringing up is a good point in terms of what is capacity auction signifying, right? And clearly, I think it's showing that there's a clear signal that we do generation and transmission investments needed in PJM. In terms of ability to invest in transmission, I think that's in a few areas. Obviously, there were the two zones that broke out above the RTO. Clearly, I think there's opportunity for additional transmission solutions going into there. So, I think we could probably expect there to be an open window to try to resolve some of that. As you know, in the past, we've been successful in winning some projects going down into the Maryland, Virginia area. So, it could be additional opportunity there in addition to just investments in our own area. I would say that from a broader strategic perspective, I think those auction results also would reinforce our strategy in working with the state of Pennsylvania and the other EDCs in the state to help resolve the resource adequacy concerns that many of us have been talking about for a while now, in particular, in PJM. And so we're not going to just sit back and wait for this issue to resolve itself. We have an obligation to serve and do everything that we can for our customers, whether it's these additional transmission investments, I think we can do additional grid-enhancing technologies on the existing grid and then continuing to advocate for legislative change. So, we'll continue to push that agenda to ultimately lower the price of electricity for our customers and reduce the volatility. Yes. Well, look, I think the biggest difference, Shar, is what's in the queue, right? And what we right now is significant amounts of dispatchable generation being retired with very little dispatchable generation coming on. And so I think that's the big -- the big issue is not so much the energy play. It's the capacity play and having -- making sure that we have enough capacity to serve 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365. So, that's really the big difference, I would say, from what we're seeing now. And so what's being left in the market is creating real concerns around resource adequacy, I think there's a few signposts that we're certainly watching to determine what the long-term impact of this capacity option will be in terms of our customer bills, but also just on resource adequacy, we want to see what the auction results are for the 2026, 2027 planning year, which will happen in December. Same thing for the 2027, 2028 planning here. That will occur next June. I want to see if there's any new dispatchable generation entering the queue between now and December, right? We suspect that the IPPs will want to see more than just this one data point before they're committing to building new dispatchable gen like natural gas. So, we'll be keeping an eye on that. So, there's a few things that we'll be looking at. This, of course, is one data point, but I think it clearly supports our strategy, which is we sure we keep resource adequacy front and center. We think the states are going to have to play an active role in that. Unfortunately, I think Pennsylvania is taking this seriously, and we look forward to continuing to work with all the stakeholders in the state to see what we can do to show this up. Thanks Shar. Morning Durgesh. Yes, of course. So, I would say for the near-term impact for customer bills, and this of course, assumes all else equal, right, which never is the case. But all else equal, we would estimate that these higher prices would impact the generation portion of the bill for an average customer by about $10 to $15 per month. That represents roughly 5% to 10% of the total bill. We would expect that to begin in 2025 as our suppliers start to reflect these higher prices in their solicitation bids. I did talk in our prepared remarks, fortunately, in addition to the other actions that I just talked about with Shar, that we're taking on this issue. We are seeing that substantial data center load. And if we just stick with that 5 gigs in advanced stages, right, that would reduce our customer bills over time by a similar amount that we're talking as a result of the capacity price increases once that demand all comes online. So, lots of moving parts on here. Obviously, the capacity prices will have a near-term increase impact and then we'll look to mitigate that over time with various actions, including the data center look coming online. Thanks Durgesh. Morning Dave. Well, I certainly don't want to get in front of that process that right, it's a very extensive process that we go through when we update the IRP. We are required to update that in October with the commission. The reason I say that, Dave, is, obviously, we have to do a full load forecast update, right? So, we'll look at what's going on with the industrial growth, what's going on with data centers, just general customer -- new customer additions and what we're seeing from a relatively useful customer perspective. We also have to take into account energy efficiency programs, distributed energy resources, penetration, of course, electric vehicles are starting to come in. So, we will do a comprehensive load forecast with multiple scenarios around that forecast and that ultimately feed into how we believe we will need to deal with that from a migration supply perspective, which could include a combination of dispatchable resources to ensure we have capacity there, which would be something like another combined cycle natural gas plant, but it could also entail additional solar or renewable resources, batteries similar to what we got approved last year. So, I don't want to get in front of what that result will be, but suffice it to say, we'll go through that full analysis that we'll have a pretty good sense when we file that what our generation needs. And then if it shows the need for incremental generation, we would follow that up shortly thereafter with the CPCN to request approval for that. Yes, you're not going to love this answer, but it depends, right? Are we talking peakers? Are we talking combined cycle? Do you own turbines -- do you have to get in the queue? Theoretically, if you own turbines and we're talking peakers, and you've done some site work probably 18 months, 18 to 24 months on the short end. If you're starting from scratch and you want to go combined cycle, it's probably four to five years. Thanks Dave. What we're seeing with the current 5 gigs is that, that starts in 2026, we would expect to be at our first gig in 2027 and then probably added 1 gig each year thereafter. Yes, it's about $3 a month per gigawatt. So, by the time we get the full 5 gigawatts, it would be about $15 a month in lower bills for the per residential customers. Yes, sure. I mean in general, I mean, $84 million isn't going to necessarily impact our rate case timing, Julian. But -- so we'll look to continue to deploy that technology and seek recovery in our next base rate case. Joe, you can talk about timing on that? Yes. So, near-term transmission upgrades, those will go in line with the requests. Just to give you -- again, we're in a $10 million to $75 million per project range in Kentucky, just given the size of the projects down there just to give you a sense for the 350 megawatts that are in more advanced stages in Kentucky, that's just under $30 million of incremental capital there on the transmission side. So, those will be done in concert with the data center demand coming on. In terms of the generation, any large-scale generation like would not come online until around 2030. That's the indication we've gotten from the commission, when we talk to EPC contractors, when we look at when we can get the turbines, that's probably where we're talking in kind of the 2030 timeframe. So, obviously, the few years prior to that is when we'll be spending the capital. Hello Ryan. Yes. So look, we're making good progress with the developers on all of those. We're working through the PJM planning process as well as the PUC processes, all of that is progressing well. I would say probably no change, Ryan, from what we talked about on the Q1 call. We still expect that any formal announcements would come kind of at the end of the year, beginning of next year. The data center companies are going to want to make sure we get through those full processes before they're announcing. So we would expect that to be really around the end of the year, beginning of next year. That's all 5. I mean, again, that's really very project specific. So, we'll update this quarterly so you have a sense of how we're progressing on overall data center demand in our jurisdictions, how much is in the queue, how much is in advanced stages. We'll try to provide updated CapEx estimates as we go along. But it'd be hard to again, we're talking $50 million to $150 million. So, that's a $100 million range depending on the project. So, we'll keep that disclosure updated as we go. No, I mean this was really -- the decision to sell the building was a kind of post-COVID had way too much real estate from what we needed. It was underutilized. And so nothing to do with headcount. Likewise. Well, look, I think there's a number of things we're focused on, Anthony, right? There's resource adequacy overall in the market, in particular, in PJM. And so if those higher prices incentivize new generation and sure resource adequacy, that's a good thing, for all of us in PJM. We talked about the higher cost that will ultimately bear for our customers, which obviously is not great for our customers, but we're looking at all alternatives to see how we can bring that generation to bear in the most lease cost way, as you know. So, there are some puts and there are some takes, I would say, with that print. Yes, that's why the range is $10 to $15. So, we have in the early part of 2025 where we've already procured that power. It wouldn't have as big of an impact as the back half when we're procuring additional power and those prices might be reflected in what we're buying. So, the next solicitation is October, 4th quarter of this year. So, we're suspecting that those prices will make its way into that solicitation. Great. Thank you. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. We will be in New York next week and hopefully, we'll get to see as many of you as we can then. So, thanks again for joining."

            "name": "Joe Bergstein",
            "content": "Thank you, Vince and good morning everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. PPL's second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share compared to $0.15 per share in Q2 2023. We recorded special items of $0.12 per share during the second quarter, primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. Adjusting for these special items, second quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.38 per share, an improvement of $0.09 per share compared to Q2 2023. Primary drivers of this increase where returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes, primarily due to the return to more normal weather conditions. In total, we estimate that weather was about $0.04 favorable compared to the prior year and about $0.01 favorable to normal conditions. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily due to higher debt balances with the issuances at PPL Electric, Rhode Island Energy earlier this year, which were executed at attractive rates favorable to our forecast. And we'll continue to monitor the markets and leverage our excellent credit position to be opportunistic and efficiently finance our capital plans. Our Q2 performance puts PPL's GAAP earnings at $0.67 per share year-to-date through June 30th compared to $0.54 per share through the same period last year. Adjusting for special items recorded through the second quarter, earnings from ongoing operations totaled $0.92 per share for the first half of 2024, an improvement of $0.15 per share compared to the first half of 2023. We estimate that weather has been $0.07 favorable compared to the first six months of 2023, while tracking slightly below normal conditions year-to-date in 2024. The full year-to-date ongoing earnings walk by segment is included in the appendix. Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the second quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.05 per share compared to the second quarter of 2023. The improvement in Kentucky's results was driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to the return to normal weather and lower operating costs. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.05 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was driven by higher transmission revenues and higher sales volumes due to a combination of a return to normal weather and increased usage per customer. Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher distribution revenue from capital investments, higher transmission revenue, and higher interest income, partially offset by higher operating costs and higher property taxes. Finally, results at corporate and other decreased by $0.02 per share compared to the prior period, primarily due to higher interest expense. With another strong quarter behind us, we're on track to achieve at least the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast of $1.69 per share. I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance as we continue to execute our plan and our Utility of the Future strategy. This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince. Sure. Hi Durgesh, it's Joe. So, look, I'd just say that our balance sheet is in really good shape, and we expect to be within the FFO to debt range of 16% to 18% through the planning horizon. Capital is just one factor that goes into our financing needs, and we'll work that through as we update our business plan. But obviously, there's other things that drive those financing needs to determine what will ultimately do, interest rates, inflation, our efficiency strategy certainly plays a role in that and then rate case outcome. So, as we go through the plan, and incorporate all of these factors, including potential additions for data centers and other opportunities, we'll take that into -- but again, our balance sheet is in really good shape. Yes, Dave, it's Joe. Certainly, beyond 2026, we continue to see opportunities. Vince mentioned, AI and some of the use cases that we're seeing that we think can drive longer-term O&M efficiency opportunities. Clearly, we're focused on achieving the $175 million that we've laid out, which we're in good -- making good progress on and we'll achieve that we'll continue to look for opportunities beyond that time frame. But certainly, there will be opportunities to get more efficient. Yes, I think at this point, the earliest we would see a rate case in Pennsylvania would be 2026 and that would be at the earliest, we may be able to go beyond that timeframe. Again, it's point, he's right $84 million isn't going to drive that decision, but we'll deploy it, and we'll seek recovery of that in the next rate case whenever it may be."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. \n I'd now like to turn the conference over to Andy Ludwig, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAndy Ludwig: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the PPL Conference Call on First Quarter 2024 Financial Results. We have provided slides for this presentation on the Investors section of our website. \n Begin today's call with updates from Vince Sorgi, PPL President and CEO; and Joe Bergstein, Chief Financial Officer and conclude with a Q&A session following our prepared remarks. \n Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. Our presentation today contains forward-looking statements about future operating results or other future events. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Please refer to the appendix of this presentation and PPL's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements.\n We will also refer to non-GAAP measures, including earnings from ongoing operations or ongoing earnings on this call. For reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the appendix.\n I'll now turn the call over to Vince. \nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.42 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.54 per share representing a 12.5% increase over ongoing earnings of $0.48 per share a year ago. This increase was supported by additional returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes as we saw milder weather last year compared to this year. \n Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability deliver on our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. with a midpoint of $1.69 share. We are also on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability for our customers. \n At the same time, we remain confident in our long-term business plan as we execute our strategy to create the utilities of the future. \n We're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth through at least 2027. As we outlined in February, our capital plan includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027. And across PPL, we continue to drive greater efficiency through our utility of the future strategy to help keep energy affordable for our customers. \n With this in mind, we're on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026. \n Moving to Slide 5 with an operational and regulatory update. We were pleased to secure positive outcomes in our second annual infrastructure, safety and reliability or ISR proceedings before the Rhode Island PUC. ISR plans are submitted annually in Rhode Island and outline proposed capital investments and related operating costs to strengthen safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas distribution networks. The plans approved this March address Rhode Island Energy's proposed spending from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. \n In its decision, the PUC unanimously approved $326 million in planned spending and investment. This includes approximately $300 million in capital investments, including $132 million for electric and $168 million for gas and $26 million in operating costs for vegetation management, restoration paving on gas main replacement projects, system inspections and other work. These investments are critical to maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of electricity and gas service for our customers in Rhode Island and will help to enable the clean energy transition in the state.\n Shifting to Pennsylvania. Last week, PPL Electric Utilities filed a petition with the Pennsylvania PUC to raise the company's distribution system improvement charge cap from 5% to 9% of distribution revenues for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2025. \n The DSIC accelerates the repair and replacement of aging infrastructure by allowing utilities to recover the cost of investments in eligible property. As we confront more frequent and powerful storms and aging infrastructure, we believe an increase is needed maintain and improve reliability moving forward. We expect minimal impact to customer bills because of this change, and we look forward to engaging with the commission as they consider our request. We expect a decision on this petition by year-end. \n PPL Electric Utilities also recently filed its latest default service plan with the PaPUC. The plan, which was filed in Q1 reflects our strong focus on energy affordability and outlines the company's strategy to procure generation supply for customers who don't choose a third-party energy supplier.\n To best support our customers, the proposed plan includes modifications to lessen price volatility, improve affordability, support resource adequacy and foster the growth and development of renewable generation in Pennsylvania. \n During the planned design, PPL Electric leverage data analytics to optimize the proposed procurement strategy for affordability. We expect the modifications to result in lower supply cost for our customers during the term of the plan, which is from June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2029. We expect a decision from the PaPUC on this plan by year-end as well.\n Moving to Slide 6. We continue to advance plans to support prospective data center development in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. As we work with data center companies, we feel we are very well positioned to serve their needs for a variety of reasons. For starters, we have capacity on our grid such that the needed investment by the data centers is not too significant. This also enables connection to our grids in a timely manner, supporting their desired commercial operation date. In addition, our reliability is very strong with top quartile reliability. \n Our states also have an abundance of reasonably priced land available for these data centers. Further, we are close to large metropolitan markets in New England and Mid-Atlantic regions. And finally, we have programs in both states that provide incentives for data centers to locate in our service territories. \n Our current business plan does not reflect the investments or load related to these large data center projects. So any meaningful deployment in this space would represent upside to the plan. In Pennsylvania, we continue to see record numbers of requests within our service territory, including some very large centers that are projecting more than a gigawatt of load at full capacity. \n We currently have approximately 3 gigawatts data center demand in advanced stages. The potential upside for PPL comes in the form of additional required investments in transmission and returns on the related rate base through the FERC formula rate. \n Currently, we estimate that each data center would require on average, $50 million to $150 million of capital investment, and that's PPL share, depending on the size, location and specific needs of the data center. As the sensitivity of the $125 million of PPL investment, would result in about $0.01 of EPS. And despite this added investment, we expect that our retail customers in Pennsylvania will benefit as well as the transmission component of the bill will decrease as they are spread over increased load.\n In Kentucky, we are also actively working with several large data centers. The data centers we're currently seeing in Kentucky range between 300 and 500 megawatts each. Like Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades would be additive to our capital plan, although those will be more modest than the levels we are currently seeing in Pennsylvania due to the smaller size of the data centers. The more significant upside potential from additional data center demand is due to the vertically integrated nature of our Kentucky business as a significant ramp in electricity demand could also result in incremental generation needs in our service territory. Any additional generation investment would also represent upside to our current capital plan.\n From a timing perspective, based on our ongoing dialogue, we would expect to have a better sense of these opportunities in the latter half of the year and into 2025. Ultimately, data centers are key to American competitiveness and AI deployment moving forward, and we are actively engaged to support their expansion. \n Moving to Slide 7 and some items on the horizon. On April 25, the EPA announced a suite of final rules related to fossil fuel-fired power plants. The 4 rules announced are Section 111 greenhouse gas CO2 standards, which requires that all coal-fired plants and new baseload gas-fired plants control 90% of their carbon pollution via carbon capture technology or other means by 2032. \n The affluent limitation guidelines, which establishes more stringent discharge standards for 3 different wastewaters generated at coal-fired plants. The coal combustion residuals rule, which requires additional coal ash management for inactive CCR units, which were formerly exempt. And the mercury and air toxic standards rule or MATS, which tightens the emission standard for toxic metals by 67% and finalizes a 70% reduction in the emission standard for mercury from coal-fired plants. \n We expect these rules to be challenged by various parties and that it will likely take years to go through the legal process. Should these rules be upheld in the courts, it could exacerbate the resource adequacy concerns in the 2030s while resulting in significant incremental environmental capital investments and/or additional capital needs for generation replacement in the latter part of our planning period and beyond. These rules will also be considered in the request for proposal recently issued by LG&E and KU for renewable energy. \n The RFP is seeking to evaluate alternatives procure lease cost long-term supply of renewable energy to serve our customers. These potential additions would help to address load growth, diversification of the generation portfolio and the newly issued EPA regulations. Proposals are due back by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to complete our review in the fourth quarter.\n Looking ahead in Kentucky, LG&E and KU expect to file their triennial integrated resource plan in the fourth quarter of this year. The IRP will be a comprehensive review of electricity supply and demand within our service territories over a 15-year planning horizon. We'll also update our load forecast for our service territories, which will include updated assumptions for electrification, industrial growth and potential data center development as well as any updates to energy efficiency trends. \n Supply forecast will include the results of our recently approved CPCN late last year to retire 600 megawatts of coal generation and replace that with a combination of efficient combined cycle natural gas, solar and battery storage capacity.\n We will also include recommendations received from the KPSC during our last IRP filing including updates to our demand-side management and energy efficiency programs, transmission needs and recently issued environmental regulations. \n Following our IRP filing, we'll then conduct another climate assessment and expect to publish an updated report in 2025.\n That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. \nJoe Bergstein: Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. PPL's first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.42 per share compared to $0.39 per share in Q1 2023. We recorded special items of $0.12 per share during the first quarter primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. \n Adjusting for these special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.54 per share an improvement of $0.06 per share compared to Q1 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments, higher sales volumes and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our solid first quarter results keep us on track to achieve at least the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast of $1.69 per share.\n During the quarter, we issued a combined $1.2 billion of debt in 2 separate offerings. We were focused on early execution of the financing plan, which allowed us to take advantage of rates lower than the current market and derisk for the remainder of the year. \n In January, we issued $650 million of first mortgage bonds at PPL Electric Utilities at 4.85%. And in March, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes at Rhode Island Energy at 5.35%, which represented the first debt offering for Rhode Island Energy since our acquisition. \n We saw tremendous demand for both transactions, and we're able to execute them at efficient prices given the relative market conditions.\n PPL's balance sheet remains among the very best in our sector and provides the company with significant financial flexibility. We continue to project a 16% to 18% FFO to debt ratio throughout our planning period while maintaining a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%. As of the end of the first quarter, our floating rate debt exposure remains at just about 5% and we have limited near-term refinancing risk. \n Finally, we remain uniquely positioned in the sector to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our planning period. \n Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the first quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. The improvement in Kentucky's results was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to the extremely mild weather experienced during the first quarter of last year. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.03 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher transmission revenue and lower operating costs. \n Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher distribution revenue from capital investments, higher transmission revenue and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher interest expense. \n Finally, results at Corporate and Other decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the prior period primarily due to factors that were not individually significant. \n I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our plan. \n This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince. \nVincent Sorgi: Thank you, Joe. In closing, our strong performance in the first quarter keeps us squarely on track to deliver on our 2024 commitments to shareowners. As we continue to execute our utility of the future strategy, we're well positioned to achieve or exceed the midpoint of our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in executing our capital plans, keeping us on track to invest $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year. The newly issued EPA regulations, while they present some real reliability concerns for the industry represent only further upside to our long-term outlook for the business. \n We continue to make good progress in integrating Rhode Island Energy into PPL keeping us on pace to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid this year. \n And finally, we remain laser-focused on driving efficiency through our Utility of the Future strategy, centralization efforts and asset optimization to keep energy affordable for our customers. \n All in all, we are well positioned to continue our strong track record of execution this year. \n And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nJames Kennedy: It's actually James on for Shar. Maybe starting on the data center side, thanks for all the details on the backdrop across the 2 jurisdictions there. Can you just give us maybe a little bit more color on the timing of the spend for those 3 gigawatts in Pennsylvania as it relates kind of to the current plan through '27? And then secondly, how kind of firm is that advance stage at point -- at this point for those guys? \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, sure, James. So just in terms of firmness, we do have signed agreements for that 3 gigawatts. So continuing to work through the process with multiple data center companies would probably be in a position or would not be in a position to make a public announcement either from them or us until kind of late this year, early next year. So still a little bit of ways to go on these, but we do have signed agreements with them all. \n These would be for in-service dates beginning in 2026. So I think -- '26, '27, '28. And then again, we would be making the bulk of our investments right in time for those initial and service dates. \nJames Kennedy: Okay. Got you. And then keeping it in Pennsylvania, if the DSIC waiver process were unsuccessful, I guess, how would that impact the rate case cycle plan and any impact to the distribution spend plan as it's laid out today? \nJoe Bergstein: Yes, James, this is Joe. First, it wouldn't impact our distribution capital plans. Those are necessary investments that we'll continue to make. What it would do is potentially impact the timing of our next rate case, although as we've said, no rate case in Pennsylvania this year or next. So really likely timing could be as early as '26, but again, we'll have to see the outcome of that petition and what the commission decides on there. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: Just on the data center topic, I know the opportunity set is in the transmission investment for you. Well, maybe can you help us kind of frame, is there new generation or additional generation attached to these contracts? If you can talk to that? And then secondly, you mentioned '26 to '28 time line, how are you thinking about the construction time line and any sort of risks on approvals, I'm thinking FERC approvals or any other approvals that you may need to get the projects going? \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, sure. So the agreements that we've signed basically enable us to start the development work of the projects, and it would result in reimbursement back to the company should we not move forward with the data center. So data center companies are really taking the risk on that. Overall, we feel good about our ability to get these projects approved through the regulatory process. But you're right, we do need to go through that process. But we are currently spending money on the development for the ones that at least we have the signed agreements, we're starting those now to be ready for a 2026 the initial service fee.\n On the generation side, so yes, the investment opportunity is really twofold. In Pennsylvania, it's really just the transmission investment that we need to make. These are large centers, so they're connecting to T. Again, we're in the $50 million to $150 million per data center range. That's our share. So the data center is also picking up in similar-sized investments on each of these. So that's kind of the investment opportunity in PA. \n Kentucky, again, not as big of data centers, at least the initial ones that we are engaged with there. So the investment opportunities are a little bit smaller, around the $25 million to $75 million per data center range there. But as your question kind of highlights, I think the biggest opportunity from an investment perspective is really on the need for additional generation in Kentucky. \n Our current reserve margins are in the 23% range. We kind of target a 17% to 24% range down there with the solar projects that we have and that we're building, we would expect absent anything else to be a little bit over 25%. So obviously, keeping all of this in mind as we put together the IRP. So we'll be updating our full load forecast, including potential data centers, but all the other industrial loads that are coming from the economic development activity, but we also have to look at energy efficiency and DER and everything else that's a counterbalancing there. And then determine if we need additional generation. \n I will say, importantly, as we think about the possibility of needing to build the second combined cycle unit down there, whether it's for the data centers or just industrial growth in general, I think it's important to note that we do still have a spot in the queue for that second CCGT from our prior solicitation. So our ability to build that relatively quickly is there. \nDurgesh Chopra: That's very, very helpful, Vince. But can I just go back Pennsylvania and the way you structure this transmission agreement, is that tied to a new generation source? I know that's not an opportunity for you, but I'm just curious from a sort of a Pennsylvania state perspective, supply-demand perspective. Is that a new generation source? Or are you basically getting power from an existing generation source? I don't know if that makes sense. Did you get the question I'm asking? \nVincent Sorgi: I do. Yes, it is not tied to any specific generation. So ultimately the market through PJM and/or other means needs to continue to build new generation to keep up with this demand. But that will go through the general PJM process. \nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's perfect. And then just one quick one, and I'll get back in the queue. Is there a procedural schedule on the DSIC application, the raising cap or sort of specific time lines for us to watch? \nVincent Sorgi: There isn't, although we do expect to basically have a decision on both the DSIC waiver and the LTIP filing by the end of the year. So in general, the LTIP takes about 9 months, those types of filings, and we think it makes sense. Obviously, we requested the DSIC decision to be before the end of the year so that we could apply it for 2025. \nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. I also want to echo James' thanks and comments on the data center information really helpful. And congrats on a great quarter here. Thank you again. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. \nSteven Fleishman: So just to kind of -- because we're hearing a lot about data centers. Could you give us any sense of just like how meaningful the deposits are for you to be pursuing this in terms of just the scheme of scale the whole thing, just as it is -- kind of helps to assess just likelihood, I guess? \nVincent Sorgi: Yes. So I don't want to get into details around like deposits or anything like that [indiscernible], although I will say the agreement, again, that we are -- that we signed in Pennsylvania, those agreements permit us to start spending on these and then we would get recovery of those for some reason if we don't move forward. So I think the curiousness of the counterparties is there [indiscernible] clearly, right? And for all the reasons I talked about in my prepared remarks, I think we do bring a number of benefits to bear for these folks. Not the least of which is not only our capacity to connect them, but our ability to meet their in-service deadlines. So we can get this work done in time for 2026 in service states for these data centers. \n So as of right now, again, to your point, it's never done until it's done, and I appreciate that. But as of now, I'd be pretty disappointed if we didn't get at least 1 data center in our service territories. I would expect more than that though. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then just in terms of -- I mean, we're hearing data center growth in several other parts of the PJM market. And I'm just wondering, do you see the potential need for more transmission, not for necessarily your own data center, but just for all this broader growth potential in PJM that could create more need and obviously move power flows and the like. Any thoughts there. \nVincent Sorgi: Yes, absolutely. And you saw some of that. We've won in a FERC 1000 process last year to build into the Dominion zone for some of the data center load down there. So yes, to your point, depending on where these pockets set up, because generally, as we're talking with these data center companies, it's not necessarily just one and done. If they can build one, their intention is to expand upon that. And so I think you'll start to see these data center hubs start to get created around the country. Obviously, there's economies of scale if they're kind of bundling together.\n And to your point, that creates a demand for transmission into those areas and again, in the Dominion zone, we ended up winning it was like $100 million to $150 million project to help handle that congestion. So yes, I do think that's a continued opportunity indeed. \nSteven Fleishman: Okay. And then a different topic. Just in Pennsylvania on the DSIC waiver filing. Is this something that -- is something that could be settable thing? Or is this something really where the commission just needs to decide? \nVincent Sorgi: Yes. In general, certainly, where we can engage with the commission end up with something in between, sure, certainly. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the questions-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Vince Sorgi for closing remarks. \nVincent Sorgi: Thanks a lot. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. I do want to remind everyone that this Saturday is the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby, which is the most exciting 2 minutes in sport. So enjoy the race, and we hope to see you soon. Thanks, everybody. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 9. PPL's first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.42 per share compared to $0.39 per share in Q1 2023. We recorded special items of $0.12 per share during the first quarter primarily due to integration and related expenses associated with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy. \n Adjusting for these special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.54 per share an improvement of $0.06 per share compared to Q1 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were returns on capital investments, higher sales volumes and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher interest expense. Our solid first quarter results keep us on track to achieve at least the midpoint of our 2024 earnings forecast of $1.69 per share.\n During the quarter, we issued a combined $1.2 billion of debt in 2 separate offerings. We were focused on early execution of the financing plan, which allowed us to take advantage of rates lower than the current market and derisk for the remainder of the year. \n In January, we issued $650 million of first mortgage bonds at PPL Electric Utilities at 4.85%. And in March, we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes at Rhode Island Energy at 5.35%, which represented the first debt offering for Rhode Island Energy since our acquisition. \n We saw tremendous demand for both transactions, and we're able to execute them at efficient prices given the relative market conditions.\n PPL's balance sheet remains among the very best in our sector and provides the company with significant financial flexibility. We continue to project a 16% to 18% FFO to debt ratio throughout our planning period while maintaining a holding company to total debt ratio below 25%. As of the end of the first quarter, our floating rate debt exposure remains at just about 5% and we have limited near-term refinancing risk. \n Finally, we remain uniquely positioned in the sector to continue to fund our growth without the need for equity throughout our planning period. \n Turning to the ongoing segment drivers for the first quarter on Slide 10. Our Kentucky segment results increased by $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. The improvement in Kentucky's results was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily due to the extremely mild weather experienced during the first quarter of last year. Our Pennsylvania Regulated segment results increased by $0.03 per share compared to the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily driven by higher transmission revenue and lower operating costs. \n Our Rhode Island segment results increased by $0.01 per share compared to the same period a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by higher distribution revenue from capital investments, higher transmission revenue and lower operating costs, partially offset by higher interest expense. \n Finally, results at Corporate and Other decreased by $0.01 per share compared to the prior period primarily due to factors that were not individually significant. \n I'm extremely pleased with our financial performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our plan. \n This concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to Vince. Yes, James, this is Joe. First, it wouldn't impact our distribution capital plans. Those are necessary investments that we'll continue to make. What it would do is potentially impact the timing of our next rate case, although as we've said, no rate case in Pennsylvania this year or next. So really likely timing could be as early as '26, but again, we'll have to see the outcome of that petition and what the commission decides on there."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Vincent Sorgi",
            "content": "Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter investor update. Let's start with our financial results and a few highlights from the quarter on Slide 4. Today, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.42 per share. Adjusting for special items, first quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $0.54 per share representing a 12.5% increase over ongoing earnings of $0.48 per share a year ago. This increase was supported by additional returns on capital investments and higher sales volumes as we saw milder weather last year compared to this year. \n Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability deliver on our 2024 ongoing earnings forecast of $1.63 to $1.75 per share. with a midpoint of $1.69 share. We are also on track to complete approximately $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year to strengthen grid reliability and resiliency and advance a cleaner energy mix without compromising on affordability for our customers. \n At the same time, we remain confident in our long-term business plan as we execute our strategy to create the utilities of the future. \n We're well positioned to achieve our projected 6% to 8% annual earnings per share and dividend growth through at least 2027. As we outlined in February, our capital plan includes $14.3 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2024 to 2027. And across PPL, we continue to drive greater efficiency through our utility of the future strategy to help keep energy affordable for our customers. \n With this in mind, we're on pace to achieve our annual O&M savings target of at least $175 million by 2026. \n Moving to Slide 5 with an operational and regulatory update. We were pleased to secure positive outcomes in our second annual infrastructure, safety and reliability or ISR proceedings before the Rhode Island PUC. ISR plans are submitted annually in Rhode Island and outline proposed capital investments and related operating costs to strengthen safety, reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas distribution networks. The plans approved this March address Rhode Island Energy's proposed spending from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025. \n In its decision, the PUC unanimously approved $326 million in planned spending and investment. This includes approximately $300 million in capital investments, including $132 million for electric and $168 million for gas and $26 million in operating costs for vegetation management, restoration paving on gas main replacement projects, system inspections and other work. These investments are critical to maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of electricity and gas service for our customers in Rhode Island and will help to enable the clean energy transition in the state.\n Shifting to Pennsylvania. Last week, PPL Electric Utilities filed a petition with the Pennsylvania PUC to raise the company's distribution system improvement charge cap from 5% to 9% of distribution revenues for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2025. \n The DSIC accelerates the repair and replacement of aging infrastructure by allowing utilities to recover the cost of investments in eligible property. As we confront more frequent and powerful storms and aging infrastructure, we believe an increase is needed maintain and improve reliability moving forward. We expect minimal impact to customer bills because of this change, and we look forward to engaging with the commission as they consider our request. We expect a decision on this petition by year-end. \n PPL Electric Utilities also recently filed its latest default service plan with the PaPUC. The plan, which was filed in Q1 reflects our strong focus on energy affordability and outlines the company's strategy to procure generation supply for customers who don't choose a third-party energy supplier.\n To best support our customers, the proposed plan includes modifications to lessen price volatility, improve affordability, support resource adequacy and foster the growth and development of renewable generation in Pennsylvania. \n During the planned design, PPL Electric leverage data analytics to optimize the proposed procurement strategy for affordability. We expect the modifications to result in lower supply cost for our customers during the term of the plan, which is from June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2029. We expect a decision from the PaPUC on this plan by year-end as well.\n Moving to Slide 6. We continue to advance plans to support prospective data center development in both Pennsylvania and Kentucky. As we work with data center companies, we feel we are very well positioned to serve their needs for a variety of reasons. For starters, we have capacity on our grid such that the needed investment by the data centers is not too significant. This also enables connection to our grids in a timely manner, supporting their desired commercial operation date. In addition, our reliability is very strong with top quartile reliability. \n Our states also have an abundance of reasonably priced land available for these data centers. Further, we are close to large metropolitan markets in New England and Mid-Atlantic regions. And finally, we have programs in both states that provide incentives for data centers to locate in our service territories. \n Our current business plan does not reflect the investments or load related to these large data center projects. So any meaningful deployment in this space would represent upside to the plan. In Pennsylvania, we continue to see record numbers of requests within our service territory, including some very large centers that are projecting more than a gigawatt of load at full capacity. \n We currently have approximately 3 gigawatts data center demand in advanced stages. The potential upside for PPL comes in the form of additional required investments in transmission and returns on the related rate base through the FERC formula rate. \n Currently, we estimate that each data center would require on average, $50 million to $150 million of capital investment, and that's PPL share, depending on the size, location and specific needs of the data center. As the sensitivity of the $125 million of PPL investment, would result in about $0.01 of EPS. And despite this added investment, we expect that our retail customers in Pennsylvania will benefit as well as the transmission component of the bill will decrease as they are spread over increased load.\n In Kentucky, we are also actively working with several large data centers. The data centers we're currently seeing in Kentucky range between 300 and 500 megawatts each. Like Pennsylvania, any transmission upgrades would be additive to our capital plan, although those will be more modest than the levels we are currently seeing in Pennsylvania due to the smaller size of the data centers. The more significant upside potential from additional data center demand is due to the vertically integrated nature of our Kentucky business as a significant ramp in electricity demand could also result in incremental generation needs in our service territory. Any additional generation investment would also represent upside to our current capital plan.\n From a timing perspective, based on our ongoing dialogue, we would expect to have a better sense of these opportunities in the latter half of the year and into 2025. Ultimately, data centers are key to American competitiveness and AI deployment moving forward, and we are actively engaged to support their expansion. \n Moving to Slide 7 and some items on the horizon. On April 25, the EPA announced a suite of final rules related to fossil fuel-fired power plants. The 4 rules announced are Section 111 greenhouse gas CO2 standards, which requires that all coal-fired plants and new baseload gas-fired plants control 90% of their carbon pollution via carbon capture technology or other means by 2032. \n The affluent limitation guidelines, which establishes more stringent discharge standards for 3 different wastewaters generated at coal-fired plants. The coal combustion residuals rule, which requires additional coal ash management for inactive CCR units, which were formerly exempt. And the mercury and air toxic standards rule or MATS, which tightens the emission standard for toxic metals by 67% and finalizes a 70% reduction in the emission standard for mercury from coal-fired plants. \n We expect these rules to be challenged by various parties and that it will likely take years to go through the legal process. Should these rules be upheld in the courts, it could exacerbate the resource adequacy concerns in the 2030s while resulting in significant incremental environmental capital investments and/or additional capital needs for generation replacement in the latter part of our planning period and beyond. These rules will also be considered in the request for proposal recently issued by LG&E and KU for renewable energy. \n The RFP is seeking to evaluate alternatives procure lease cost long-term supply of renewable energy to serve our customers. These potential additions would help to address load growth, diversification of the generation portfolio and the newly issued EPA regulations. Proposals are due back by the end of the second quarter, and we expect to complete our review in the fourth quarter.\n Looking ahead in Kentucky, LG&E and KU expect to file their triennial integrated resource plan in the fourth quarter of this year. The IRP will be a comprehensive review of electricity supply and demand within our service territories over a 15-year planning horizon. We'll also update our load forecast for our service territories, which will include updated assumptions for electrification, industrial growth and potential data center development as well as any updates to energy efficiency trends. \n Supply forecast will include the results of our recently approved CPCN late last year to retire 600 megawatts of coal generation and replace that with a combination of efficient combined cycle natural gas, solar and battery storage capacity.\n We will also include recommendations received from the KPSC during our last IRP filing including updates to our demand-side management and energy efficiency programs, transmission needs and recently issued environmental regulations. \n Following our IRP filing, we'll then conduct another climate assessment and expect to publish an updated report in 2025.\n That concludes my strategic and operational update. I'll now turn the call over to Joe for the financial update. Thank you, Joe. In closing, our strong performance in the first quarter keeps us squarely on track to deliver on our 2024 commitments to shareowners. As we continue to execute our utility of the future strategy, we're well positioned to achieve or exceed the midpoint of our 2024 ongoing earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in executing our capital plans, keeping us on track to invest $3.1 billion in infrastructure improvements this year. The newly issued EPA regulations, while they present some real reliability concerns for the industry represent only further upside to our long-term outlook for the business. \n We continue to make good progress in integrating Rhode Island Energy into PPL keeping us on pace to exit our remaining transition service agreements with National Grid this year. \n And finally, we remain laser-focused on driving efficiency through our Utility of the Future strategy, centralization efforts and asset optimization to keep energy affordable for our customers. \n All in all, we are well positioned to continue our strong track record of execution this year. \n And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. Yes, sure, James. So just in terms of firmness, we do have signed agreements for that 3 gigawatts. So continuing to work through the process with multiple data center companies would probably be in a position or would not be in a position to make a public announcement either from them or us until kind of late this year, early next year. So still a little bit of ways to go on these, but we do have signed agreements with them all. \n These would be for in-service dates beginning in 2026. So I think -- '26, '27, '28. And then again, we would be making the bulk of our investments right in time for those initial and service dates. Yes, sure. So the agreements that we've signed basically enable us to start the development work of the projects, and it would result in reimbursement back to the company should we not move forward with the data center. So data center companies are really taking the risk on that. Overall, we feel good about our ability to get these projects approved through the regulatory process. But you're right, we do need to go through that process. But we are currently spending money on the development for the ones that at least we have the signed agreements, we're starting those now to be ready for a 2026 the initial service fee.\n On the generation side, so yes, the investment opportunity is really twofold.

But as of now, I'd be pretty disappointed if we didn't get at least 1 data center in our service territories. I would expect more than that though. Yes, absolutely. And you saw some of that.

So yes, I do think that's a continued opportunity indeed. Yes. In general, certainly, where we can engage with the commission end up with something in between, sure, certainly. Thanks a lot. And I just want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. I do want to remind everyone that this Saturday is the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby, which is the most exciting 2 minutes in sport. So enjoy the race, and we hope to see you soon. Thanks, everybody."
