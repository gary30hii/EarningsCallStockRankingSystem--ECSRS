[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman. Please go, ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you remain safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ve posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today\u2019s call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings release and the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. As we started New Year, I want to once again thanks for more than 8,000 TransUnion associates, who continue to work diligently from their homes throughout this pandemic, in order to support the needs of our customers and consumers in these uncertain times. Our client service hasn't missed a beat and it's all due to their amazing efforts. I also I also appreciate how they've supported TransUnion\u2019s embrace of social justice causes during this time of turmoil and transition in the U.S. We continue to focus on diversity and inclusion among our associates and in the communities we serve. On our last call, I discussed our total impact taskforce, more clearly conveyed the intention of the taskforce, we renamed it Racial Equity Taskforce. While the name is changed, the mission remains the same to combine and connect TransUnion\u2019s efforts to support racial equity and social justice. The taskforce will amplify our advocacy and outreach through consumer tools and support designed to improve access to economic opportunity. For example, we partner with the credit builders alliance, which helps underserved communities to build credit. Additionally, we will double our corporate giving in 2021, in Chicago and Philadelphia, the locations of TransUnion\u2019s two largest offices. We also have reallocated funds from sports partnerships to charities in our communities that support racial equity. We see further opportunities to partner with local organizations that promote grassroots targeted support for underserved communities, such as my block, my hood, my city in Chicago and the Covenant House in Philadelphia. The taskforce will also reexamine the use of data in our analytics and solutions to ensure that all uses are consistent with our values and the goal of financial inclusion in the economies that we serve. To that end, we engaged a specialized consultancy in the fourth quarter of last year to objectively assess our data and model development to identify opportunities to improve our practices. And finally, the task force working with TransUnion\u2019s Chief Talent and Diversity Officer is formulating clear commitments for diversity in new hires and promotions. We've also expanded racial bias training throughout the organization and provided managers with direction and tools to build a more inclusive workplace. These actions support our public commitments, including the Chicago networks equity principles campaign and they pledge to work toward achieving gender equity and global leadership roles by 2030. And the CEO action for diversity and inclusion pledge to advance diversity and inclusion in our workplaces. In a short time, the taskforce has made encouraging progress and I have no doubt that we will achieve our goal of making TransUnion a truly diverse and inclusive organization that plays a positive role in the communities that we serve. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will review the global organizational changes we've made and the considerable investments we are making in solutions, operations and technology to ensure that we continue to deliver strong growth and margins in the years ahead. Over the past 18 months, we established global centers of excellence and solutions, operations and technology. We also commenced project rise, a multiyear effort to streamline, standardize and migrate our technology stack to a hybrid public and private cloud model. [Plus known] are the considerable efforts and investments we've self funded to improve our core solutions and to establish an effective and share global operational spine, because these actions strengthen our foundation for future success. Next, I'll review the performance trends in the fourth quarter across the various geographies we serve. Throughout this presentation, you will hear a consistent story of TransUnion advancing our solutions, services and go-to-market approach to respond the current conditions, while also re-architecting our business to free resources to invest in future growth. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our fourth quarter results in detail along with first quarter and full year \u201821 guidance. Now since taking over as CEO of TransUnion, my leadership and I have developed an ambitious set of initiatives to fundamentally strengthen TransUnion while navigating the challenges created by the global pandemic and the need to address social justice issues. Now, clearly we began with a strong business with a history of success. However, we\u2019ve recognized the opportunity to raise our performance and create an even better version of key use for our stakeholders. Over the past year, you've heard me discuss the areas for improvement on which we're focused technology via project rise, global operations and global solutions. Today, I want to review the opportunities before us and our progress to-date. These various initiatives together form a transformational program to strengthen TransUnion. Internally, we refer to this program as our path to possible, meaning our path to building the best version possible up TransUnion and to maintain high rates of revenue growth and increasing margins into the future. So let's start with Project Rise, our accelerated initiative to make TransUnion\u2019s technology more scalable, secure, efficient and effective. I begin here as technology forms the bedrock of TransUnion. And in many ways, we are a technology company, right built upon Project Spark, a systems migration from costly complicated mainframe technology to a modern, flexible, distributed and hybrid cloud architecture. And since Spark\u2019s completion, we've implemented new technologies and tools as they became available to improve systems reliability and security. Importantly, we also integrated acquisitions, such as Callcredit, iovation and eBureau that utilize the public cloud, gaining important experience in hybrid public and private cloud architectures. This consistent investment in technology has laid the groundwork for Project Rise. So let me remind you of some of the expected benefits. First, like many technology enabled companies, we have the opportunity to further streamline our application ecosystem. We've already worked through more than 1,000 applications and determine their path forward, whether we re-factor, re-host for platform or retire that allowing us to simplify the delivery of IP on a global basis, reduced costs and increase our speed to market. Second, we'll implement a hybrid cloud infrastructure to create economies of scale around computing, and intellectual property distribution. Our on premise infrastructure currently operates at high levels of efficiency. And the additional use of public clouds helps us to optimize our computing capabilities. This approach has already allowed us to power key international opportunities in countries such as India and Chile, as well as to provide the spine for our media vertical, which I'll talk about in more detail shortly. Third, we will leverage the growing arsenal of innovative cloud based tools to enable faster product development. Examples include new compliance tools, analytic stacks, model training, machine learning and other cutting edge technologies. We've delivered the first set of foundational cloud services to our development teams and expect the first deployments into production in the second half of this year. Given our focus on talent and building continuity for the long-term, we continue to embrace up-skilling our workforce. In this regard, we've made considerable progress in training our internal teams with 80% having completed or currently enrolled in cloud training, including hundreds receiving full AWS certification in addition to the new hires that we brought on this past year. We believe developing our internal talent will make our company cloud native just like our technology. This will allow us to continuously evolve and stay nimble in the future. The only very attractive marketplace benefits, we expect Project Rise to deliver between $20 million and $30 million per year of operating expense reductions beginning in the year \u201823. Project Rise represents a critical evolution of our technology strategy and enables significant long-term opportunities and efficiencies for TransUnion. Global operations provides another way to deliver efficiencies and facilitate commercial success through centralization, process optimization and automation leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that we will reinvest in growth projects. Our team has identified three areas of greatest potential impact and they've made significant progress thus far. First, we expanded our disciplined procurement processes to all of our purchasing. We've renegotiated our largest contracts and recently began to focus on the remaining opportunities. We've reduced costs while adding features and functionality. We also have begun implementing a lifecycle procure-to-pay system from Coupa, enabling complete spin visibility globally. We've already deployed the tool in the U.S., Canada, in the U.K. and we'll add more of our major markets in \u201821. Second, we continue to expand on the success of our global capability center or GCC in Chennai, India, which now employs more than 900 associates. We added another center in Pune, India in the fourth quarter of last year focused on providing analytics services across our organization. In this year, we opened GCC in Johannesburg, South Africa to provide a range of business services in order to flex capacity and to create continuity safeguards. Each GCC meets the growing needs of our customers, while refining our delivery and support capabilities in eliminating concentration risk. They also allow us to cost effectively process more sophisticated and confidential work than we could using third-parties. And finally, we're focused on business process refinement and automation to enhance customer experience. Most significantly, we are implementing a standardized global CRM system that when coupled with our GCCs forms an effective technology and operational fulfillment spine for transparent, high quality customer support. Set another way we're creating a structure to efficiently process work, so we can focus on delivering the best experience for our customers. Together, we are confident that global operations will deliver significant effectiveness and cost benefits. And we will reinvest these in growth and enhanced margins in order to drive shareholder value. Now moving to global solutions. In a short time, this team has delivered some exciting successes along with an array of important partnerships and acquisitions. We've organized around key horizontal solutions, such as credit, fraud, analytics, decisioning and others and then staff these teams of experienced leaders develop and diffuse configurable platform solutions across our various geographies and vertical markets. First, let me talk about our internally generated opportunities. And then I'll turn to how we've leveraged our core capabilities into new areas to partnerships and acquisitions. So let's start with our refocus strategy and fraud. The second largest solution offering a TransUnion behind credit. We have an outstanding starting point with our suite of fraud solutions. In fact, in November of last year, Javelin Strategy & Research Ranks TransUnion best-in-class among 26 providers on its identity proofing scorecard. After hiring, security industry veteran, Shai Cohen, we undertook an extensive review of our solutions and market position. The outcome of this work suggested an opportunity to rebrand, standardize and integrate our various fraud mitigation products into a unified solution which utilizes our best capabilities. While this will require time and investment, we've already begun to rebrand all of our product solutions globally under the umbrella of TruValidate. We will also refocus our sales efforts on the most appropriate market segments and user profiles. This strategic repositioning represents a starting point for creating a truly integrated and global fraud mitigation business within TransUnion. I also want to share another recent success in solutions from our international markets. As COVID led to an explosion of ecommerce, many customers in emerging markets lack an integrated data enabled solution for activating new accounts. To meet this need, we created a digital on-boarding solution that bundles our suite of data pre-fill, ID verification, credit scoring and origination decisioning tools through a common orchestration layer. We deliver this tool in a single API that customers can deploy as a mobile application, as a mobile website, as a white label tool and integrated into their own platforms. The modular design allows them to buy a full solution or individual components based on their needs. The digital on-boarding solution suite represents a great example of our global diffusion strategy at work. We rapidly launched in India, South Africa, Colombia in the Philippines, creating a multimillion dollar business in under a year. We have a strong inventory of sales wins in these markets that will ramp this year. And we're also exploring applications in more developed markets. In addition to these two efforts, we brought to market several solutions to aid customers with the uncertainties created by the COVID pandemic, including our CreditVision Acute Relief attributes, which were adopted rapidly to enhance portfolio risk assessment as well as new customer acquisition. Now turning to how we've leveraged partnerships to create new growth sectors, let's talk about employment and income verification. On our October earnings call, we announced a partnership with MX, which aggregates financial information on more than 45 million consumers through consumer permission connectivity with a myriad of banks, credit unions and FinTech players. Through this partnership, which covers the U.S. and Canada, TransUnion will enable consumers to enrich their credit profiles, while helping lenders to make more informed decisions. I'll ask you to hold on to these thoughts about MX for a moment while I review another highly complementary partnership with the largest payroll provider in the U.S. Just a few days after our last earnings call, we announced this partnership in the [mainly] introduced a differentiated income and employment verification solution. We understood that our customers wanted these tools combined with their credit search in order to simplify their workflow. The solution we launched in late October did exactly that and customers have responded favorably. Since the announcement, we received numerous inbound inquiries from a variety of industries and lenders and closed multiple contracts with clients who have begun to transact. Now let's talk about how these two partnerships together. Fundamentally, they provide a more complete view of consumers to better informed decisions about customer acquisition and risk. More tangibly, we will create a solution that first pings our payroll processing partner. If we don't get hit there, we can then query MX to determine if they have checking account data that indicates employment and income. By doing so, we expand the universe of consumers that we can reliably verify. We expect this tailored solution to launch in the second half of \u201821. Verification solutions complement our credit based solutions thus expanding our addressable market and providing another long-term growth sector. Before I move on, I want to note that the solutions team also played an instrumental role in a number of other recent investments. We completed a minority equity investment and formed a commercial partnership with FinLocker, a secure online data store that enables consumers to gather their financial information online and then grant permission to lenders initially in mortgage to access it for underwriting purposes. We also partnered with socially determined, the Social Health Risk Analytics company to create tools to assess and mitigate health risk by using a combination of social risk and clinical data. This creates another growth path for our healthcare vertical. On the last earnings call, we highlighted our growth plans in media, which focused primarily on digital marketing solutions. We built the vertical through a series of acquisitions, true signal, signal and true optic that complement the array of data and world class linking and matching logic of TransUnion. Together these acquisitions in our in-house capabilities allow us to compete for audience segmentation and identity resolution market share to growing categories within the larger digital marketing ecosystem. As we scaled up this business, we've added new high caliber talent, like Jessica Hindlian, who recently joined us from Nielsen where she served as SVP of product for advanced video advertising and identity. She will lead our vertical specific channel and our product partnerships. We've also quickly realized meaningful commercial success. We have completed partnerships with Comscore to enable precision targeting in a cookie free environment and wide orbit to bring enhanced audience targeting to their streaming radio and podcast advertising solutions. And we have expanded in existing relationships, and will now power connectivity for leading retailers at marketplace. So this concludes my discussion of our significant investments. I'll reiterate that there are immense opportunities that we've created through Project Rise, Global Operations and Global Solutions. And we've accomplished a lot in a short time, giving us even greater confidence in the long-term impact from these initiatives. Now, I'd like to pivot to our fourth quarter results and walk you through some of the business and market trends. I'll start with U.S. markets. With a review of the online transaction volumes for financial services, our largest vertical market, volumes remain strong in mortgage improved in consumer lending, while auto in card held relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. I would note that in card, we continue to compare against strong volumes from the successful launch of a new card in the second half of 2019. Now excluding that impact, our volumes and card would better reflect the underlying market. I also want to let you know now that going forward, we do not intend to provide this level of volume detail. We introduced these slides in response to the severe impact of the pandemic on financial services. Given the relative stability in the market, and hopefully, the early stages of recovery, we will return to our normal disclosure practices beginning with the first quarter of 2021. Now let's spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the vertical. So beginning with consumer lending, it continued to recover during the quarter, as larger FinTech lenders slowly returned to customer acquisition, fueled by solid levels of investor commitment to funding loans. Consumer demand remains tepid. As low credit card balances, cash out refinancings and stimulus payments have reduced the demand for certain installment products like debt consolidation and short-term loans. On the other hand, we continue to see significant growth with point-of-sale lenders both from their own success as well as share gains. Auto lending was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, as new car sales picked up while the used car market tightened as inventory levels remain challenge. As digital auto retailing grows, we continue to see demand for our prequalification solutions, including auto payment shopper. And positively, we also have seen some early signs of lenders returning to marketing activities as their portfolios stabilized. The credit card market remains fairly stable as the industry showed modest signs of recovery from the sharp declines in the second quarter. We also continue to see a slow recovery in marketing and believe that there is considerable pent up consumer demand that should fuel this category in the future. Now I want to spend a minute taking a slightly deeper dive on our mortgage business, which delivered outstanding growth in 2020 on the strength of both refinancing and home purchase activities as interest rates remain historically low. On this chart, you can see the incredible growth in the market app over these last two years, creating a very challenging stack of comparisons as we enter 2021. As always, we have spent considerable time with our customers and advisory boards, while also incorporating an array of public data to develop our outlook for the market this year. Based on this rigorous work, we believe that the mortgage market will decline about 10% in 2021. More specifically, we anticipate continued strengthen mortgage in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter and then weaker second half as volumes taper off and comparisons remain very challenging. Now we will update you if our view changes as the year unfolds. I want to wrap up though with a quick view of our financial services sales pipeline. Despite the impact of the pandemic on our markets, our sales team delivered exceptionally strong results. Our healthy pipeline reflects our effective customer engagement and highly relevant product offerings, including a substantial number of credit visual wins that demonstrate the long runway for the solution. For the full year, we increased our new wins in dollars by almost 40% behind a win rate that's just shy of 50%. We attribute the success to the nimble changes our sales teams made to conduct business virtually along with our thought leadership that provided tangible assistance to customers and of course the strength and breadth of our product portfolio. And now shifting to our U.S. emerging verticals. Most of them saw trends generally improved or at least stabilized during the fourth quarter. Beginning with healthcare performance played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Front-end volumes continued to slowly recover, as providers saw outpatient volumes returned to pre-COVID levels. In-patient visits remain depressed but stable as patients showed caution about returning to the healthcare venues. Emergency Department continued to show weaker but stable trends. The impact of reduced front-end volumes negatively affects the back-end of the business resulting in a reduced number of potential coverage discovery opportunities. Despite the headwinds that we faced, the vertical only declined mid single-digits for the full year reflecting the importance of our offerings. And even if the U.S. Healthcare System lost more than $320 billion in 2020, we saw solid levels of new business wins last year. As our business helps providers recover cash, we remain well positioned to help healthcare providers protect their revenue and balance sheets. And as we look forward, we see no structural change to this market, such that we won't return to a more steady growth profile post-pandemic. Now shifting to insurance. This vertical defined slightly in the fourth quarter, as we had a modestly more challenging comparison than in the third quarter. However, the vertical delivered growth for the full year as a result of our successful diversification into areas such as commercial auto, life, group life and other types of property and casualty insurance. Notably, we realized significant growth in our sales pipeline with new business won in \u201820, exceeding our strong 2019 levels. Many of the deals involved multi product wins, reflecting our attractive suite of products. In our partnership with Neuro-ID began to generate revenue. As a reminder, Neuro-ID helps customers understand biometric behavior during the online application, providing insight into potential fraud based on how consumers enter data. The solution uses the same data to explain why consumers abandon applications, so processes can be refined. As online applications increase in insurance, this partnership positions us to capitalize on that trend. And public sector grew significantly as most government agencies operate as business as usual, providing meeting necessary support for their constituents. We posted strong new sales in the quarter at the State and Federal levels and also increased our opportunity pipeline. Our media vertical grew both on a reported and organic basis as we continue to make meaningful progress against the strategy I highlighted earlier. We also delivered growth in our screening business, which includes both tenant and employment screening. We saw solid performance in tenant screening as leasing companies remain active in our SmartMove screening product made additional inroads in the marketplace. Employment screening remains depressed as it mirrors employment trends. And the telco market recovered largely as we expected with consumers returning to more normal device purchasing levels. And finally, although collections is counter-cyclical over time, we don't expect any uptick in the near future as loan forbearance programs and collections moratoriums delay demand. Further, government payments during the pandemic has helped many consumers to stay current on their loans or reduce their debt loads. Now moving to consumer interactive, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in our direct business due to increased advertising and higher conversion rates on our -- to our subscription products. Consumers continue to value our credit health and identity protection services. Our indirect channel remains soft as financial products lead aggregators has experienced diminished demand from the lenders they serve for new client acquisition. Reduced acquisition levels has caused some of our clients to cut back on their own marketing causing a decline in their subscribers and negatively impacting our revenues, a portion of which are based on subscriber levels. Although the standard -- this dynamic is now stabilized and we are seeing some recovery it created a growth headwind for our business in 2020. Wrapping up with our international segment, let's look at revenue trends which illustrate the ongoing recovery across our geographic footprint. Generally, successful re-openings have allowed economies to restart, leading to increase overall economic activity. However, as we've all seen, the duration in the durability of re-openings varies greatly market-to-market. At the same time, our team's done an outstanding job partnering with customers to assist them in managing through the impacts of the pandemic. You'll hear about new products, new business wins and creative ways that we deliver thought leadership. Now, let me turn to the specifics for each region. In the U.K., we returned to growth, excluding the impact of a divestment earlier in the year. While lending markets remained depressed, they did improve in the fourth quarter, particularly for mortgage. As in previous quarters, the alternative lending market continues to see pressure. Though the burgeoning buy-now pay-later space has provided a source of growth as we hold a strong leadership position. Our fraud in gaming and gambling positions also showed further improvement and setting the stage for future growth. We have eight contracts with one of the U.K. is the largest lenders to provide them, the credit view platform and our open banking solution. Now our Canadian business grew again in the fourth quarter, despite generally weak lending markets and continually escalating COVID mitigation restrictions. Our good performance reflects the meaningful portfolio diversification that we've intentionally developed including insurance and public sector expansion, direct-to-consumer offerings and growth in the emerging FinTech market. And in India, the country has now fully reopened, resulting in slowly improving transaction volumes, including very strong volumes during the [valley], which typically drives the strongest business of the year. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio as well as specific programs to address critical pandemic driven issues. For instance, we extended our string of significant business wins supporting the Indian government, as they work with lenders, small businesses and consumers to provide incremental oversight and stimulus during pandemic. We also engaged with our FinTech customers, by setting up our innovation lab on the cloud and inviting them to compete with our developers to see who can deliver the best performing models. And through our TGIF or TransUnion Great Insights Fridays, we've had interactions with more than 300 discrete lenders bringing them important insights about the market consumers in their own businesses. As we look ahead, India remains a singularly vibrant and innovative market with significant growth potential for years to come. As the lending market transitions from traditional products, the high velocity, short-term low dollar loans, we expect hundreds of millions of Indians to enter the credit economy. And in the case of small businesses only about $10 million of the $60 million currently have loans. These changes have meaningful implications for TransUnion\u2019s addressable market and we remain extremely well positioned to benefit from them. In Latin America, we serve a variety of markets and most remain somewhat stable, albeit at depressed levels compared to last year. Notably, Colombia delivered a solid quarter of growth on the strength of our FinTech insurance and telco businesses. As we've discussed previously we expect to slow and long linear recovery in many of these markets. In Asia Pacific, the market in Hong Kong has stabilized so generally depressed levels as the fall-out from the pandemic and political unrest continues. We returned to growth on the strength of our re-launched direct-to-consumer offer. We expected to provide a meaningful source of growth in \u201821 likely exceeding the previous revenue run rate over time. Now rounding up APAC, the Philippines continues to face significant headwinds, as the country has struggled reopened, impacting consumers and our customers. Our team held its first lending summit to bring more sophisticated thought leadership to the market. Even as we roll-out credit vision which provides a superior tool for our customers to assess lending risk, particularly in this current environment. Longer term, we remained confident in optimistic that the Philippines will return to attractive growth. The South African economy remains challenged, particularly with the second wave of COVID spread causing further lockdowns recently. As in other markets, our team has responded by prioritizing our customers\u2019 needs, like account management collections in ecommerce. They have successfully expanded uptake of key solutions, such as CreditVision, TruValidate and digital on-boarding to drive value for customers. Now, just taking you through how TransUnion has managed effectively through the global pandemic, while also accelerating investments that set up our path to what is possible. So I'll now turn it over to Todd to walk you through our financial results in detail and our first quarter and full year 2021 guidance. So over to you Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. We delivered solid results at the high end of our guidance as we benefited from gradual improvement across almost all of our markets as well as the strength and diversity of our portfolio. I'll start with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the fourth quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise. So starting with the income statement, fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a recorded and constant currency basis to signal in Tru Optik acquisitions had just under 1 point of impact. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% on a reported basis and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.5%, down about 170 basis points compared with the year ago quarter. As Chris pointed out we have aggressively invested in our business this year and that had some impact on the margin along with the broader macro challenges of the pandemic. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. Our adjusted EBITDA was down slightly, we continue to benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing and lower LIBOR rates as well as a lower adjusted tax rate of 21.9%. The lower tax rate reflects our tax planning initiatives and the reduction in the statutory rate in India. Now looking at segment financial performance, the U.S. markets revenue was up 4% compared to the year ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had about 1.5 points of impact on revenue. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 7%. As Chris discussed, we saw improvement in consumer lending continued strength in mortgage as well as stability in card and auto. And to address the significant impact of mortgage in the quarter excluding the cyclical growth the vertical would have declined mid-single digits. Emerging verticals were flat on a reported basis and down 3%, excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. Growth in public sector, media and tenant and employment screening helped moderate declines in the other verticals. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% as reported in 1% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined largely as a result of the strategic and operational investments that Chris discussed. The cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions as well as the normal quarter-over-quarter seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel, adjusted EBITDA for Consumer Interactive was down 2% as we continue to increase in marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and see solid returns on that investment. So my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment revenue fell 2% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions, as Chris discussed in detail. As we mentioned on our February 2020 call, we invested -- we divested a small business in the U.K. Recipero excluding that divestiture international would have been down only 1% and our U.K. business would have flipped from being down 1% to up 2%. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 4%. One of the managed strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $493 million of cash on the balance sheet after voluntarily prepaying $150 million of our term-loans and funding the first tranche of the Tru Optik acquisition and several smaller investments. For clarity, the Tru Optik transaction entails an initial payment and a subsequent smaller earn-out in 2021 based on the performance of the business. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continued to decline from 2.9 times at the end of the third quarter to 2.8 times at the end of December. With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a good position to continue to be proactive in pursuit of additional attractive investments as an important part of our overall long-term growth strategy. So that brings us to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, which is based on the current market conditions and doesn't incorporate the potential for a much stronger second half driven by the possibility of a more rapid economic recovery. As you've come to expect from us, we won't hopefully build plans based on best case scenarios rather, we'll take a balanced, realistic approach. We firmly believe that doing so is in the best interest of our shareholders as it avoids unnecessary risk. Starting with first quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik as well as a similar tailwind to revenue from FX. And we expect a 50 basis point benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Revenue is expected to come in between $698 million and $707 million or a 2% to 3% increase. This results in organic constant currency revenue growth being flat to up 1%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximately 3 point benefits from mortgage, which lines up with Chris\u2019s comments about our expectations for a strong first half, followed by headwinds in the second half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $268 million and $275 million, an increase of 2% to 4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.78 and $0.81, an increase of 6% to 10%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and 1 point of tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $2.817 billion to $2.877 billion, up 4% to 6%. Based on the mortgage expectation Chris shared, our guidance includes about 2 points of headwinds from our anticipation of the 10% decline in our mortgage revenue. So on an organic constant currency basis excluding mortgage, the remainder of the business is expected to grow 4% to 6%. I would also like to point out that the cadence of the year will be fairly lumpy. The first quarter should look somewhat similar to the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 should be the strongest on a year-over-year basis given the relatively easy comps. And in the back half, we would expect the benefits of ongoing economic recovery to be offset by mortgage headwinds. Through our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow revenue, mid single-digits. Financial services could be flat and emerging verticals to be up high single-digit, including the impacts of mortgage, U.S. markets would be up high single-digit, and financial services would be up mid single-digits. We anticipate that international will grow high single-digits in constant currency as we continue to see a very pace of recovery across our market and we expect Consumer Interactive to be up slightly as the lead aggregators slowly returned to customer acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.083 billion and $1.121 billion up 4% to 7%. We expect 1 point of benefit from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.16 and $3.31, up 5% to 10%. I want to wrap up with some thoughts about some of our other annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be about 23%, which is fairly consistent with the 2020 rate of 22.6%. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $375 million, a modest increase from 2020. Excluding the step up from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $190 million. Third net interest expense should be about $100 million, down about $20 million in 2020. As a result of a lower forward LIBOR curve and our voluntary debt prepayment. Fourth, capital expenditures will be around 8% of revenue. And finally, for the full year 2020, we spent about $19 million on Project Rise. That was added back for our non-GAAP metrics. We expect this add-back to nearly triple in 2021 a significant step up from the first the second year of the project, as we expected, and as if we built significant momentum. I'll now turn the call back to Chris, for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Well, thank you, Todd. And to conclude this morning, you've heard more about the meaningful progress we've made in fundamentally improving TransUnion to Project Rise, Global Operations and Solutions. Each delivers immense value to TransUnion over the long-term, and in tandem, they have an even greater potential to help us sustain industry leading top line growth and an attractive and growing margin. At the same time, our business continues to perform well in the midst of some very challenging conditions. I'll end by reiterating I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And thank you for joining us this morning. So with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. So for the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And now let's jump into those questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. On mortgage, what percentage of your consolidated revenue was U.S. mortgage in 2020? And the reason I ask is, I thought it was lower than 20%. But you're saying its 10% market declines about a 2 point headwind, I wouldn't think that there's share shifts given that it's mostly selling to the tri merge resellers. But if you could just clarify what's the exposure and maybe help score the minus 10 two point headwind? Thanks.\nTodd Cello: Hey, Jeff. Good morning. And thank you for the question. This is Todd. I'll take that one. So as far as your mortgage earned, historically TransUnion spoken about our overall exposure to U.S. mortgage being roughly maybe 7% to 8% of revenue that went up last year to about 13% which is very -- obviously very significant, but not something that we anticipate that will stay at that level throughout 2021, as we both kind of alluded to in our opening remarks. We do expect mortgage to continue to be relatively stable to maybe slightly decline in the first half of the year. But right now, the visibility that we have with mortgage would just suggest that there would be a slowdown and the way that, again, that we've put it is 10% decline in our mortgage revenues, specifically in -- for the full year and again, that that will temporarily happen in the second half of 2021.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Just a broad question, Chris, 2021 was always going to be a lot of moving pieces. And it sounds like you've taken a relatively conservative approach to stock, correct me if I'm wrong there, but just looking out into 2022? Do you see any notable moving pieces perhaps media, gaming, some other categories where you think could be in a notable contributed to the growth to getting you back to kind of what we used to historically.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good morning, Manav. So as I commented before, I think \u201821 will be a bit of a mixed bag, the first half and the second half will be different. The first half is likely to be choppier just given the state of the public health situation. But in markets like the U.S. as vaccines are rolled-out and I think the population returns to health, you'll see a material strengthening across the different verticals in which we compete. And that leads to a stronger second half. And also I expect that we will roll with some good momentum into 2022. And start to compound the top line, in a manner consistent with what we have done previously. That's certainly the aspiration at this point. I would say that mortgage remains the critical wildcard here, over the course of \u201821. As Todd just said, we are modeling in about a 10% decline in the category. And it has swelled [30%] of our revenue, so it's more material than previous. With that said, nobody's crystal ball is perfect. And it is quite material to the financial results that we've outlined in our guidance this morning. So the best I can tell you is, one we provided more detail into how we arrived at the number than we typically would and will ongoing. And two, if we see a material change in our assumptions, we'll certainly communicate with the market quickly because we will have a direct bearing on the results. And then the last thing I would say is look as our economy heals from the pandemic, we start to get back to normal. And I take more of a global perspective here, there are key components of our portfolio that will return to health and growth that have been somewhat uniquely impacted in the pandemic. The first comes in our consumer direct business where 60% of the revenues are focused on providing reports and analytics to indirect players, the marketing lead aggregators for financial services. And as lenders pulled out of the market in terms of client acquisition, their businesses were materially impacted and that became quite a headwind for us. Additionally, as you know we have strong and disproportionate market share in the FinTech space and in consumer lending and that was also an area that I think was the hardest hit of the different financial services verticals in the U.S. And then finally, our international portfolio, which has over $600 million now was a consistent double-digit compound grower. And those three things have been muted, somewhat because of the pandemic. They're all stable now and they're all resuming growth. But again, as the global health situation improves and the pandemic recedes, you're going to see acceleration in those three components, as well as the other piece parts of our portfolio. And I think we're well positioned for recovery. And again, I guess just one concluding remark, if you look at the guidance that we have provided where we've broken out the financial services performance and then attempted to isolate the mortgage component within that, but then also highlighted the growth rates across our emerging verticals portfolio in the U.S., you can see that we're really expecting quite a bit of strengthening across the vast majority of our portfolio in \u201821, some very attractive, high single-digits organic growth rates, but again somewhat muted by the mortgage headwind and the general uncertainty in that category. So I'll pause there Todd, if you want to add anything?\nTodd Cello: Yes, Chris. Yes, I think that was a very comprehensive. I would just highlight a couple of more things and I think it just comes again out of our opening remarks. We've deliberately made a significant effort into the media vertical. So we are expecting at least in about \u201922 that media will be a meaningful -- start to be a meaningful contributor for us. And as well as our fraud business and as Chris, again spoke about in his openings or comments we've done a significant amount of work to get that on a common platform, rebranded it to true validate our expected on some really good growth there as well as, let's not lose sight of the fact that our FinTech customers have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and I think our expectation is they'll get more aggressive as we go through \u201821 with their marketing campaigns. I think the key point there is, let's not say that the strong relationships that we have already intact and the leading positions there, and that we fully expect that market, to rebound. So that'll be another really nice growth driver for us in employment too. Then , our insurance and healthcare verticals as well, too, I think are poised to continue to recover this year, but continues so nicely.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, so, I mean, look, Manav, you have touched on a really good question. So the way I think about how we resumed the growth that the markets come to expect from us, it really breaks down into four buckets. The first is that as the pandemic recedes, the underlying geographies and verticals that we serve are going to heal and there's nothing structural that's changed there. Two, will also resume the momentum from our product portfolio that was -- that represents all the investment in innovation that we've accumulated, right? We've got a strong -- we have many generations of product development that are still in the early-to-mid stages of adoption, this market heals, you're going to see those driving growth. On top of it and again, referencing the point Todd just made, we've got other vintages of growth that we're layering on. One is the repositioning of our [fraud] business, which we'll talk -- we've talked about in some detail, where we're bringing together the multiple fraud assets that we've acquired in creating a single global fraud growth platform focused on the most global segments for our business. We've also invested a lot in data analytics and modeling tools via Prama, we're launching the employment verification in income, vector, we continue to add new data types. And look, there's a multitude of growth categories in addition to what we've done in the media that represents the third component. And again, as always we remain active looking for complimentary M&A internationally we're always hopeful we can find geographies that we can enter. And specifically we can really improve the operations of the credit bureau. And in the U.S. really to fuel our global product development and then we're looking to add capabilities that compliment the needs that we're servicing in our clients. So potentially more than you bargained for, but that's, that's our thoroughly answer.\nManav Patnaik: I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. Wanted to ask about verification, how quickly can you ramp up that business? I know you mentioned some wins already in the [peered] launch in second half with your MX partnership. Can you just talk about your go-to-market strategy and the differentiation versus competition? And then in terms of records growth, I guess, have you added more records since that initial payroll provider? And what kind of pace do you expect to grow records going forward? I imagine it may be tougher after that sort of initial really large number that you got from that partnership? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure, Toni. I mean, obviously, this is a really exciting extension, to our product portfolio. And we think we can differentiate by really streamlining access to the credit and the employment and income verification through a common digital connection, right really leveraging the pathways that was established already. But as you know, from my comments, last time around, I tried to caution the market that, this is not a category that we're going to achieve parity with the market leader in one quarter, this is a entry into an area that is strategically important and complimentary, that we're going to put with full weight of our product resources and innovation behind developing a product that really can compete, but that will take time. In the interim, we're in a phase where we are productizing, the data and the pipeline relationships that we've established via , the large payroll processor in MX Technologies. And you're right, Toni, over time, our focus is going to be on broader and broader market coverage, which means you've got to establish more relationships. And then market coverage will be both with payroll processors, potentially other types of data providers, and these financial aggregators that will allow us to cascade broad market coverage across banks FinTech\u2019s, and credit providers. So we're in this for the long haul, we're just -- I'm just not able right now to give you like financial precision on dollar or growth rates. But look, as you know, this is a really big market. I love the competitive dynamics, I love the fact that we can pull together an offering. And we can start attacking and learning and gaining share. And that's our intention.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I'd like to look back at Slide 11 and 12 for the U.S. financial markets, this is the consumer credit activity, which really is broadly up in, not just mortgage, but auto, card consumer lending, this orange line over blue -- over yellow line. And so I'm just a little bit puzzled by the first quarter organic revenue guide of 0 to 1 year-over-year, which is, a bit of a deceleration total company from the 1% you guys just reported? And so given the credit activity, I'm asking, do you see organic revenue growth acceleration in financial services in the first quarter? And if not, why maybe puzzle together the other segments to help us understand the zero to 1 veteran total?\nTodd Cello: Hey, good morning, Andrew, This is Todd, let me let me take that question from you. And I think it's an important one to talk through in some more detail. So starting first, when you do look at Slides 11 and 12, it is important to remember that this represents online credit report volumes for our U.S. markets financial services vertical only. And just to give you kind of a perspective on that in 2020 our financial services vertical did about $939 million, so roughly about 35% of our revenues. So just that's important to keep in mind, even though the $939 million the volumes represents a certain percentage of that probably higher than online, but we also do a significant amount of batch work as you know, already, right. That's also part of that number. So I think the way that with that set is context. So I think the thing that's important also to keep in mind is just simply the comparable that we're up against in Q1 of \u201821 compared to last year. At a consolidated basis, if you were to look at Q4, 2019 to Q1, 2020 our growth rate on the consolidated basis went from 9.9 times to 10.8, which was about 1 point of growth. And for our U.S. market, financial services vertical, the growth rate went from 16.5 up to 21.8 in Q1, \u201820. So that's about 5 points of growth. So think about the comparable that that we're up against. So when you look at that then go, okay but now go sequentially from Q4, \u201820, the quarter that we just exited, where our percentage, we grew at 1.5%, now you're looking at our guide or we're calling for flat to up 1 , in Q1 of \u201821. When you get into the decimals on this, that that 1 might actually be maybe 1.5, potentially at the high end. So for all intensive purposes, if we achieve the high, we could be asked for the same growth rate that we experienced in Q4 of \u201820. So the comp and that growth rates important. Now, to the point about just the overall mix of what we're looking at on Slides 11 and 12. Please do keep in mind the international business has had a different recovery than what we've experienced in the U.S. So when we look at \u201821, we would expect our international business to experience their softest quarter in Q1 relative to the rest of the year. And as you saw, we're calling for the full year to be up high single-digits for international. So that hopefully answered your question, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Hey, guys, good morning. This is I think the second quarter in -- either in a row or in the last couple where you've given some numbers around new business wins in U.S. financial services. And I guess I'll ask you a question that was asked last time, if you can help us understand anymore. But how does that 40% increase in dollar value flow through to revenue? Is there anything about that that would make it flow through more slowly, like higher mix of multiyear versus one year anything like that? Because it, yes that's a big number. And maybe the other part of it too that's just new wins? What about losses or what about customers leaving stuff like that? Just help frame how to think about that as a driver of revenue in the next year? Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good question, Gary. the first thing I would say is that, in terms of attrition for whatever reasons, there's no change that we're aware of, right. And so there's nothing to really counteract that increase in the estimated annual contract value of the deals that we closed in \u201820. Now, revenue arrival is a different [annual] than contracted sales. And it varies based on variety of factors. One is the time it's going to take to integrate to the clients and establish those relationships and in certain cases, how long it takes them to incorporate their data or render our data into their models either marketing or origination or collections, et cetera. So there can be a lag time. Related to that there can also be some time until clients ramped to their full volume potential. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that sometimes salespeople can be overly enthusiastic with the potential deal, size of the deal. Although I can't give you any evidence that their enthusiasm -- their enthusiasm has changed over the course of the pandemic. So look, a 40% increase in dollar close doesn't lead to a 40% increase in the new portion of our revenues in the coming year. But it is a really tremendous indication of the health of our product line, our sales efforts and our client\u2019s health as well. And the other thing I would just mention is that, new wins represent a new layer of revenue that we're laying upon a deep and established foundation. And it's really the volume movements in the foundation have a much more material impact on our revenue in the coming year or in the current period than does the increment, right. So I'll just pause there.\nGary Bisbee: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Appreciate the question and all the comments and color and other a lot of moving pieces here. Chris, I've got a question specifically about your media initiatives. TransUnion has terrific differentiated data and you've done a great job of commercializing it in the past, it strikes me media is one of these spaces that is very competitive. And there have been some companies, we've seen in around FinTech that have tried to crack the code and have maybe been less successful than they would have expected or just paid it. Can you just elaborate on why you think you have the ability to outperform in that vertical?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure. Well, up to your point, the media market or the market for digital advertising services is enormous and varied. We have chosen kind of a surgical entry into a portion of that market, where I feel that our matching logic in some differentiated data provides us with an advantage with an opportunity to introduce a best-in-class solution. Now before we had a media vertical, we were supporting different various ad tech companies in matching online and offline data because TransUnion and the Bureau's in general are just really good at that. And we know that our matching logic is superior to the standard that prevails in that marketplace. And so with that experience and that insight we decided to formalize the offering into a specific vertical offering. As we started to gain more experience we realized that we needed to deliver our data, all of our customer identifying data, demographic and segmentation type of data on a different platform with a user friendly access. So immediate clients can come in and slice and dice and create the audiences that they were interested in. And then we can append the digital identity and other offline, characterizing information that they could use to drive their advertising campaigns. When we bought Tru Optik, though we gained a differentiated data set because they are one of the early leaders in the market to provide insight as to which homes are consuming content via which streaming devices via video or audio, right. And so now we have differentiated data sets that we can add to our universe of data in our segmentation tool. And then also combine that with our matching, practical example of it is an advertiser can find out now that a particular home address mine or yours, as Apple TV has Netflix, uses Hulu, et cetera. But they don't know much about the household. With TransUnion, we can do that matching and say that the occupants of the household has certain characteristics, maybe a demographic, care -- just a whole range of kind of marketing, characterizing and segmenting variables. So again, it's our narrow and surgical focus into a portion of this market where I think we're upping the game. That's our value proposition. And that's why we're confident we can achieve growth.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. I appreciate that.\nOperator: The next question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Mihalos: Hey, guys, thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the Consumer Interactive vertical and specifically the guidance of up slightly for revenue. How should we be thinking about the direct versus indirect throughout the course of 2021? It is there -- is already reason why the indirect shouldn't return to growth by the back half of the year? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Hi, George, good morning. This is Todd. I will take that question for you. So I think what we're anticipating in our Consumer Interactive business is obviously specific to channel. So first, in the direct channel throughout 2020 we did experience a heightened level of consumer interest in monitoring credit. And we took advantage of that by doing some marketing to attract consumers to our webpage and offer those services. And then conversely in the indirect channel as spoken about we've definitely headwinds, it would the lead aggregate, as many of the financial services customers pull back on their marketing activity. So as you get into \u201821, we are expecting probably a more normalized growth level in the direct channel. And so not as high as [indiscernible] in \u201820. And then in the indirect channel, we are still expecting some softness in the lead aggregator base softness that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, persist, going forward with the potential for and recovery, probably in \u2013 later of the --\nGeorge Mihalos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hey, Chris, can you talk a little bit more about the reorientation of the fraud business strategically what -- what's involved in that besides pulling it together under one platform or one brand, like what -- I guess on the ground, what are you going to be doing differently, really and the business from what I understand is actually a pretty particularly strong business. And so what's going to change now?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, thanks for the question, Shlomo. Yes, it is a strong business that continues to deliver neither nice growth across all of our markets. As you know from my prior commentary, it's a business that's composed of variety of piece parts, some of which are overlapping or redundant as you look at the different geographies that we serve. And so part of what we're trying to do is or what we have done is we've looked across our portfolio and we said what are the best-in-class within TransUnion product components that we have and how do we integrate those on top of this single product platform with orchestration, with case management, with all of the different reporting and measurement controls that you would like. And look, the ultimate integration around an enterprise architecture, any single product platform, that's going to happen over a period of time because that's heavy lifting engineering type of work, right. And the need to do the work is just a function of the fact that the business developed in the U.S., it developed internationally, we acquire innovation, we acquired a really nice and fast growing business in call credit. And frankly, when you talk about integration there's multiple levels from the kind of more surface to the deep and foundational and we're committed to doing all of it. The next thing is really just a function of the market segments that we're prioritizing. So different types of customers have different fraud needs. And we have a particular strength serving those market segments where they are initiating a relationship, a financial relationship of some nature, where the magnitude of the transactions and the risk associated with transactions over the term of the relationship is going to be somewhat significant. And therefore, the upfront customer identification, device verification and just the general authentication process will take a little bit of time, will be triangulated from multiple different points. Because it's really important to know who you're dealing with, the counterparty you're dealing with and have confidence in that. And so we're focused on that part of the market. And again, this is an enormous and multifaceted market because we have, a great constellation of products that comes together to serve it most effectively. And so that will get most of the focus for our product development. Now that said, we also -- we successfully compete for business, in other segments where what you really need is a super fast, but more superficial level of authentication based on device history, perhaps geo-location and on-site behavior, right. And that could be an ecommerce based retail transaction, where you got really material share, et cetera. But think of those transactions are different from establishing a relationship with a lender or, on-site gaming or gambling where there's just a lot of dollars flowing. So to be successful, we got to concentrate our resources in a particular segment. As we've pulled together these different assets, we've come to appreciate the segments -- the segmentation landscape, if you will, at a more granular level. We will continue to serve the market in its entirety. It's just the product development focus will be more around the segments I described. And those customers that are really looking for broad, authoritative solutions, which we possess, but also assistance from their provider in implementing and configuring the solutions to get best results.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning, thank you. You had touched a little on sort of Project Rise contributing $20 million to $30 million in savings in 2023. But maybe if you could just touch on how to think about global operations and global solutions. What inning are we in terms of seeing those benefits rolled through the P&L? Is that more of a 2023 event too?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Yes, I think global operations and global solutions and the later solutions, if you really think of this vector product management layer within TransUnion. They're delivering benefits already. However, as I've mentioned, we're aggressively investing in new product development and entering new markets and also in operational streamlining and automation and all of those things. So we're using some of the early benefits that we're getting from those initiatives to cell phones and accelerate the implementations of full global programs that are going to free up a lot of resources that we will then invest in both product development to accelerate and really secure high single-digit or top line compounding that we aspire to, but also delivering margin improvements to the business. Collectively, Project Rise are the technology retooling the operations and solutions. They are going to have really material impact on how effectively we operate in the market and having spent a year strategizing and implementing which was \u201820 and now going into \u201821, and really accelerate the implementation. I'm really excited in increasing the confidence of the positive impact we're going to have.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Kevin Mcveigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin Mcveigh: Great, thanks so much. Hey, Chris I wonder, given the investments you're making, particularly around [products] and things like that, just about how that impacts your new product innovation. And this might not be able to innovate more effectively, ultimately, what that can lead to the organic growth of the business if those products coming to market?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good. So I think what you're asking Kevin is, how is the current wave of tech innovation? That's coming out of products, Project Spark, we can call Project Rise and the migration of the cloud and the, standardization around an enterprise architecture, all of that. And the short answer is that, it will definitely speed to market new product ideas, right? Because one will be leveraging IP globally and two by utilizing the public cloud, there's a lot of utility functionality around the acquisition, the care and the maintenance of underlying hardware and connectivity and even security infrastructure that we will purchases and service. There's also components to software development that we can acquire directly from our cloud service providers as services. And so the technology new product development for TransUnion becomes more focused on those areas of unique IP and value add that we bring, as diversified information services provider anchored in credit and all of the unique insights we have around the vertical market needs.\nAaron Hoffman: Excellent. So that that brings us to the end of the call today. Thank you everyone for joining us. We hope again that you are all well doing well and staying safe and healthy. We'll look forward to seeing you and talking with you in the New Year. Have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. We delivered solid results at the high end of our guidance as we benefited from gradual improvement across almost all of our markets as well as the strength and diversity of our portfolio. I'll start with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the fourth quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise. So starting with the income statement, fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a recorded and constant currency basis to signal in Tru Optik acquisitions had just under 1 point of impact. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 2% on a reported basis and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.5%, down about 170 basis points compared with the year ago quarter. As Chris pointed out we have aggressively invested in our business this year and that had some impact on the margin along with the broader macro challenges of the pandemic. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. Our adjusted EBITDA was down slightly, we continue to benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing and lower LIBOR rates as well as a lower adjusted tax rate of 21.9%. The lower tax rate reflects our tax planning initiatives and the reduction in the statutory rate in India. Now looking at segment financial performance, the U.S. markets revenue was up 4% compared to the year ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had about 1.5 points of impact on revenue. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 7%. As Chris discussed, we saw improvement in consumer lending continued strength in mortgage as well as stability in card and auto. And to address the significant impact of mortgage in the quarter excluding the cyclical growth the vertical would have declined mid-single digits. Emerging verticals were flat on a reported basis and down 3%, excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. Growth in public sector, media and tenant and employment screening helped moderate declines in the other verticals. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% as reported in 1% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined largely as a result of the strategic and operational investments that Chris discussed. The cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions as well as the normal quarter-over-quarter seasonality from the third to the fourth quarter. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel, adjusted EBITDA for Consumer Interactive was down 2% as we continue to increase in marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and see solid returns on that investment. So my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment revenue fell 2% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions, as Chris discussed in detail. As we mentioned on our February 2020 call, we invested -- we divested a small business in the U.K. Recipero excluding that divestiture international would have been down only 1% and our U.K. business would have flipped from being down 1% to up 2%. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 4%. One of the managed strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $493 million of cash on the balance sheet after voluntarily prepaying $150 million of our term-loans and funding the first tranche of the Tru Optik acquisition and several smaller investments. For clarity, the Tru Optik transaction entails an initial payment and a subsequent smaller earn-out in 2021 based on the performance of the business. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continued to decline from 2.9 times at the end of the third quarter to 2.8 times at the end of December. With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a good position to continue to be proactive in pursuit of additional attractive investments as an important part of our overall long-term growth strategy. So that brings us to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year, which is based on the current market conditions and doesn't incorporate the potential for a much stronger second half driven by the possibility of a more rapid economic recovery. As you've come to expect from us, we won't hopefully build plans based on best case scenarios rather, we'll take a balanced, realistic approach. We firmly believe that doing so is in the best interest of our shareholders as it avoids unnecessary risk. Starting with first quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik as well as a similar tailwind to revenue from FX. And we expect a 50 basis point benefit to adjusted EBITDA. Revenue is expected to come in between $698 million and $707 million or a 2% to 3% increase. This results in organic constant currency revenue growth being flat to up 1%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximately 3 point benefits from mortgage, which lines up with Chris's comments about our expectations for a strong first half, followed by headwinds in the second half of the year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $268 million and $275 million, an increase of 2% to 4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.78 and $0.81, an increase of 6% to 10%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and 1 point of tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $2.817 billion to $2.877 billion, up 4% to 6%. Based on the mortgage expectation Chris shared, our guidance includes about 2 points of headwinds from our anticipation of the 10% decline in our mortgage revenue. So on an organic constant currency basis excluding mortgage, the remainder of the business is expected to grow 4% to 6%. I would also like to point out that the cadence of the year will be fairly lumpy. The first quarter should look somewhat similar to the third and fourth quarters of 2020. The second quarter of 2021 should be the strongest on a year-over-year basis given the relatively easy comps. And in the back half, we would expect the benefits of ongoing economic recovery to be offset by mortgage headwinds. Through our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow revenue, mid single-digits. Financial services could be flat and emerging verticals to be up high single-digit, including the impacts of mortgage, U.S. markets would be up high single-digit, and financial services would be up mid single-digits. We anticipate that international will grow high single-digits in constant currency as we continue to see a very pace of recovery across our market and we expect Consumer Interactive to be up slightly as the lead aggregators slowly returned to customer acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.083 billion and $1.121 billion up 4% to 7%. We expect 1 point of benefit from FX. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.16 and $3.31, up 5% to 10%. I want to wrap up with some thoughts about some of our other annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be about 23%, which is fairly consistent with the 2020 rate of 22.6%. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $375 million, a modest increase from 2020. Excluding the step up from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $190 million. Third net interest expense should be about $100 million, down about $20 million in 2020. As a result of a lower forward LIBOR curve and our voluntary debt prepayment. Fourth, capital expenditures will be around 8% of revenue. And finally, for the full year 2020, we spent about $19 million on Project Rise. That was added back for our non-GAAP metrics. We expect this add-back to nearly triple in 2021 a significant step up from the first the second year of the project, as we expected, and as if we built significant momentum. I'll now turn the call back to Chris, for some final comments. Hey, Jeff. Good morning. And thank you for the question. This is Todd. I'll take that one. So as far as your mortgage earned, historically TransUnion spoken about our overall exposure to U.S. mortgage being roughly maybe 7% to 8% of revenue that went up last year to about 13% which is very -- obviously very significant, but not something that we anticipate that will stay at that level throughout 2021, as we both kind of alluded to in our opening remarks. We do expect mortgage to continue to be relatively stable to maybe slightly decline in the first half of the year. But right now, the visibility that we have with mortgage would just suggest that there would be a slowdown and the way that, again, that we've put it is 10% decline in our mortgage revenues, specifically in -- for the full year and again, that that will temporarily happen in the second half of 2021. Yes, Chris. Yes, I think that was a very comprehensive. I would just highlight a couple of more things and I think it just comes again out of our opening remarks. We've deliberately made a significant effort into the media vertical. So we are expecting at least in about '22 that media will be a meaningful -- start to be a meaningful contributor for us. And as well as our fraud business and as Chris, again spoke about in his openings or comments we've done a significant amount of work to get that on a common platform, rebranded it to true validate our expected on some really good growth there as well as, let's not lose sight of the fact that our FinTech customers have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic and I think our expectation is they'll get more aggressive as we go through \u201821 with their marketing campaigns. I think the key point there is, let's not say that the strong relationships that we have already intact and the leading positions there, and that we fully expect that market, to rebound. So that'll be another really nice growth driver for us in employment too. Then , our insurance and healthcare verticals as well, too, I think are poised to continue to recover this year, but continues so nicely. Hey, good morning, Andrew, This is Todd, let me let me take that question from you. And I think it's an important one to talk through in some more detail. So starting first, when you do look at Slides 11 and 12, it is important to remember that this represents online credit report volumes for our U.S. markets financial services vertical only. And just to give you kind of a perspective on that in 2020 our financial services vertical did about $939 million, so roughly about 35% of our revenues. So just that's important to keep in mind, even though the $939 million the volumes represents a certain percentage of that probably higher than online, but we also do a significant amount of batch work as you know, already, right. That's also part of that number. So I think the way that with that set is context. So I think the thing that's important also to keep in mind is just simply the comparable that we're up against in Q1 of \u201821 compared to last year. At a consolidated basis, if you were to look at Q4, 2019 to Q1, 2020 our growth rate on the consolidated basis went from 9.9 times to 10.8, which was about 1 point of growth. And for our U.S. market, financial services vertical, the growth rate went from 16.5 up to 21.8 in Q1, \u201820. So that's about 5 points of growth. So think about the comparable that that we're up against. So when you look at that then go, okay but now go sequentially from Q4, \u201820, the quarter that we just exited, where our percentage, we grew at 1.5%, now you're looking at our guide or we're calling for flat to up 1 , in Q1 of \u201821. When you get into the decimals on this, that that 1 might actually be maybe 1.5, potentially at the high end. So for all intensive purposes, if we achieve the high, we could be asked for the same growth rate that we experienced in Q4 of \u201820. So the comp and that growth rates important. Now, to the point about just the overall mix of what we're looking at on Slides 11 and 12. Please do keep in mind the international business has had a different recovery than what we've experienced in the U.S. So when we look at \u201821, we would expect our international business to experience their softest quarter in Q1 relative to the rest of the year. And as you saw, we're calling for the full year to be up high single-digits for international. So that hopefully answered your question, Andrew. Hi, George, good morning. This is Todd. I will take that question for you. So I think what we're anticipating in our Consumer Interactive business is obviously specific to channel. So first, in the direct channel throughout 2020 we did experience a heightened level of consumer interest in monitoring credit. And we took advantage of that by doing some marketing to attract consumers to our webpage and offer those services. And then conversely in the indirect channel as spoken about we've definitely headwinds, it would the lead aggregate, as many of the financial services customers pull back on their marketing activity. So as you get into \u201821, we are expecting probably a more normalized growth level in the direct channel. And so not as high as [indiscernible] in \u201820. And then in the indirect channel, we are still expecting some softness in the lead aggregator base softness that we've seen over the last couple of quarters, persist, going forward with the potential for and recovery, probably in \u2013 later of the --"

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. As we started New Year, I want to once again thanks for more than 8,000 TransUnion associates, who continue to work diligently from their homes throughout this pandemic, in order to support the needs of our customers and consumers in these uncertain times. Our client service hasn't missed a beat and it's all due to their amazing efforts. I also I also appreciate how they've supported TransUnion's embrace of social justice causes during this time of turmoil and transition in the U.S. We continue to focus on diversity and inclusion among our associates and in the communities we serve. On our last call, I discussed our total impact taskforce, more clearly conveyed the intention of the taskforce, we renamed it Racial Equity Taskforce. While the name is changed, the mission remains the same to combine and connect TransUnion's efforts to support racial equity and social justice. The taskforce will amplify our advocacy and outreach through consumer tools and support designed to improve access to economic opportunity. For example, we partner with the credit builders alliance, which helps underserved communities to build credit. Additionally, we will double our corporate giving in 2021, in Chicago and Philadelphia, the locations of TransUnion's two largest offices. We also have reallocated funds from sports partnerships to charities in our communities that support racial equity. We see further opportunities to partner with local organizations that promote grassroots targeted support for underserved communities, such as my block, my hood, my city in Chicago and the Covenant House in Philadelphia. The taskforce will also reexamine the use of data in our analytics and solutions to ensure that all uses are consistent with our values and the goal of financial inclusion in the economies that we serve. To that end, we engaged a specialized consultancy in the fourth quarter of last year to objectively assess our data and model development to identify opportunities to improve our practices. And finally, the task force working with TransUnion's Chief Talent and Diversity Officer is formulating clear commitments for diversity in new hires and promotions. We've also expanded racial bias training throughout the organization and provided managers with direction and tools to build a more inclusive workplace. These actions support our public commitments, including the Chicago networks equity principles campaign and they pledge to work toward achieving gender equity and global leadership roles by 2030. And the CEO action for diversity and inclusion pledge to advance diversity and inclusion in our workplaces. In a short time, the taskforce has made encouraging progress and I have no doubt that we will achieve our goal of making TransUnion a truly diverse and inclusive organization that plays a positive role in the communities that we serve. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will review the global organizational changes we've made and the considerable investments we are making in solutions, operations and technology to ensure that we continue to deliver strong growth and margins in the years ahead. Over the past 18 months, we established global centers of excellence and solutions, operations and technology. We also commenced project rise, a multiyear effort to streamline, standardize and migrate our technology stack to a hybrid public and private cloud model. [Plus known] are the considerable efforts and investments we've self funded to improve our core solutions and to establish an effective and share global operational spine, because these actions strengthen our foundation for future success. Next, I'll review the performance trends in the fourth quarter across the various geographies we serve. Throughout this presentation, you will hear a consistent story of TransUnion advancing our solutions, services and go-to-market approach to respond the current conditions, while also re-architecting our business to free resources to invest in future growth. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our fourth quarter results in detail along with first quarter and full year \u201821 guidance. Now since taking over as CEO of TransUnion, my leadership and I have developed an ambitious set of initiatives to fundamentally strengthen TransUnion while navigating the challenges created by the global pandemic and the need to address social justice issues. Now, clearly we began with a strong business with a history of success. However, we've recognized the opportunity to raise our performance and create an even better version of key use for our stakeholders. Over the past year, you've heard me discuss the areas for improvement on which we're focused technology via project rise, global operations and global solutions. Today, I want to review the opportunities before us and our progress to-date. These various initiatives together form a transformational program to strengthen TransUnion. Internally, we refer to this program as our path to possible, meaning our path to building the best version possible up TransUnion and to maintain high rates of revenue growth and increasing margins into the future. So let's start with Project Rise, our accelerated initiative to make TransUnion's technology more scalable, secure, efficient and effective. I begin here as technology forms the bedrock of TransUnion. And in many ways, we are a technology company, right built upon Project Spark, a systems migration from costly complicated mainframe technology to a modern, flexible, distributed and hybrid cloud architecture. And since Spark's completion, we've implemented new technologies and tools as they became available to improve systems reliability and security. Importantly, we also integrated acquisitions, such as Callcredit, iovation and eBureau that utilize the public cloud, gaining important experience in hybrid public and private cloud architectures. This consistent investment in technology has laid the groundwork for Project Rise. So let me remind you of some of the expected benefits. First, like many technology enabled companies, we have the opportunity to further streamline our application ecosystem. We've already worked through more than 1,000 applications and determine their path forward, whether we re-factor, re-host for platform or retire that allowing us to simplify the delivery of IP on a global basis, reduced costs and increase our speed to market. Second, we'll implement a hybrid cloud infrastructure to create economies of scale around computing, and intellectual property distribution. Our on premise infrastructure currently operates at high levels of efficiency. And the additional use of public clouds helps us to optimize our computing capabilities. This approach has already allowed us to power key international opportunities in countries such as India and Chile, as well as to provide the spine for our media vertical, which I'll talk about in more detail shortly. Third, we will leverage the growing arsenal of innovative cloud based tools to enable faster product development. Examples include new compliance tools, analytic stacks, model training, machine learning and other cutting edge technologies. We've delivered the first set of foundational cloud services to our development teams and expect the first deployments into production in the second half of this year. Given our focus on talent and building continuity for the long-term, we continue to embrace up-skilling our workforce. In this regard, we've made considerable progress in training our internal teams with 80% having completed or currently enrolled in cloud training, including hundreds receiving full AWS certification in addition to the new hires that we brought on this past year. We believe developing our internal talent will make our company cloud native just like our technology. This will allow us to continuously evolve and stay nimble in the future. The only very attractive marketplace benefits, we expect Project Rise to deliver between $20 million and $30 million per year of operating expense reductions beginning in the year \u201823. Project Rise represents a critical evolution of our technology strategy and enables significant long-term opportunities and efficiencies for TransUnion. Global operations provides another way to deliver efficiencies and facilitate commercial success through centralization, process optimization and automation leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that we will reinvest in growth projects. Our team has identified three areas of greatest potential impact and they've made significant progress thus far. First, we expanded our disciplined procurement processes to all of our purchasing. We've renegotiated our largest contracts and recently began to focus on the remaining opportunities. We've reduced costs while adding features and functionality. We also have begun implementing a lifecycle procure-to-pay system from Coupa, enabling complete spin visibility globally. We've already deployed the tool in the U.S., Canada, in the U.K. and we'll add more of our major markets in \u201821. Second, we continue to expand on the success of our global capability center or GCC in Chennai, India, which now employs more than 900 associates. We added another center in Pune, India in the fourth quarter of last year focused on providing analytics services across our organization. In this year, we opened GCC in Johannesburg, South Africa to provide a range of business services in order to flex capacity and to create continuity safeguards. Each GCC meets the growing needs of our customers, while refining our delivery and support capabilities in eliminating concentration risk. They also allow us to cost effectively process more sophisticated and confidential work than we could using third-parties. And finally, we're focused on business process refinement and automation to enhance customer experience. Most significantly, we are implementing a standardized global CRM system that when coupled with our GCCs forms an effective technology and operational fulfillment spine for transparent, high quality customer support. Set another way we're creating a structure to efficiently process work, so we can focus on delivering the best experience for our customers. Together, we are confident that global operations will deliver significant effectiveness and cost benefits. And we will reinvest these in growth and enhanced margins in order to drive shareholder value. Now moving to global solutions. In a short time, this team has delivered some exciting successes along with an array of important partnerships and acquisitions. We've organized around key horizontal solutions, such as credit, fraud, analytics, decisioning and others and then staff these teams of experienced leaders develop and diffuse configurable platform solutions across our various geographies and vertical markets. First, let me talk about our internally generated opportunities. And then I'll turn to how we've leveraged our core capabilities into new areas to partnerships and acquisitions. So let's start with our refocus strategy and fraud. The second largest solution offering a TransUnion behind credit. We have an outstanding starting point with our suite of fraud solutions. In fact, in November of last year, Javelin Strategy & Research Ranks TransUnion best-in-class among 26 providers on its identity proofing scorecard. After hiring, security industry veteran, Shai Cohen, we undertook an extensive review of our solutions and market position. The outcome of this work suggested an opportunity to rebrand, standardize and integrate our various fraud mitigation products into a unified solution which utilizes our best capabilities. While this will require time and investment, we've already begun to rebrand all of our product solutions globally under the umbrella of TruValidate. We will also refocus our sales efforts on the most appropriate market segments and user profiles. This strategic repositioning represents a starting point for creating a truly integrated and global fraud mitigation business within TransUnion. I also want to share another recent success in solutions from our international markets. As COVID led to an explosion of ecommerce, many customers in emerging markets lack an integrated data enabled solution for activating new accounts. To meet this need, we created a digital on-boarding solution that bundles our suite of data pre-fill, ID verification, credit scoring and origination decisioning tools through a common orchestration layer. We deliver this tool in a single API that customers can deploy as a mobile application, as a mobile website, as a white label tool and integrated into their own platforms. The modular design allows them to buy a full solution or individual components based on their needs. The digital on-boarding solution suite represents a great example of our global diffusion strategy at work. We rapidly launched in India, South Africa, Colombia in the Philippines, creating a multimillion dollar business in under a year. We have a strong inventory of sales wins in these markets that will ramp this year. And we're also exploring applications in more developed markets. In addition to these two efforts, we brought to market several solutions to aid customers with the uncertainties created by the COVID pandemic, including our CreditVision Acute Relief attributes, which were adopted rapidly to enhance portfolio risk assessment as well as new customer acquisition. Now turning to how we've leveraged partnerships to create new growth sectors, let's talk about employment and income verification. On our October earnings call, we announced a partnership with MX, which aggregates financial information on more than 45 million consumers through consumer permission connectivity with a myriad of banks, credit unions and FinTech players. Through this partnership, which covers the U.S. and Canada, TransUnion will enable consumers to enrich their credit profiles, while helping lenders to make more informed decisions. I'll ask you to hold on to these thoughts about MX for a moment while I review another highly complementary partnership with the largest payroll provider in the U.S. Just a few days after our last earnings call, we announced this partnership in the [mainly] introduced a differentiated income and employment verification solution. We understood that our customers wanted these tools combined with their credit search in order to simplify their workflow. The solution we launched in late October did exactly that and customers have responded favorably. Since the announcement, we received numerous inbound inquiries from a variety of industries and lenders and closed multiple contracts with clients who have begun to transact. Now let's talk about how these two partnerships together. Fundamentally, they provide a more complete view of consumers to better informed decisions about customer acquisition and risk. More tangibly, we will create a solution that first pings our payroll processing partner. If we don't get hit there, we can then query MX to determine if they have checking account data that indicates employment and income. By doing so, we expand the universe of consumers that we can reliably verify. We expect this tailored solution to launch in the second half of \u201821. Verification solutions complement our credit based solutions thus expanding our addressable market and providing another long-term growth sector. Before I move on, I want to note that the solutions team also played an instrumental role in a number of other recent investments. We completed a minority equity investment and formed a commercial partnership with FinLocker, a secure online data store that enables consumers to gather their financial information online and then grant permission to lenders initially in mortgage to access it for underwriting purposes. We also partnered with socially determined, the Social Health Risk Analytics company to create tools to assess and mitigate health risk by using a combination of social risk and clinical data. This creates another growth path for our healthcare vertical. On the last earnings call, we highlighted our growth plans in media, which focused primarily on digital marketing solutions. We built the vertical through a series of acquisitions, true signal, signal and true optic that complement the array of data and world class linking and matching logic of TransUnion. Together these acquisitions in our in-house capabilities allow us to compete for audience segmentation and identity resolution market share to growing categories within the larger digital marketing ecosystem. As we scaled up this business, we've added new high caliber talent, like Jessica Hindlian, who recently joined us from Nielsen where she served as SVP of product for advanced video advertising and identity. She will lead our vertical specific channel and our product partnerships. We've also quickly realized meaningful commercial success. We have completed partnerships with Comscore to enable precision targeting in a cookie free environment and wide orbit to bring enhanced audience targeting to their streaming radio and podcast advertising solutions. And we have expanded in existing relationships, and will now power connectivity for leading retailers at marketplace. So this concludes my discussion of our significant investments. I'll reiterate that there are immense opportunities that we've created through Project Rise, Global Operations and Global Solutions. And we've accomplished a lot in a short time, giving us even greater confidence in the long-term impact from these initiatives. Now, I'd like to pivot to our fourth quarter results and walk you through some of the business and market trends. I'll start with U.S. markets. With a review of the online transaction volumes for financial services, our largest vertical market, volumes remain strong in mortgage improved in consumer lending, while auto in card held relatively stable quarter-over-quarter. I would note that in card, we continue to compare against strong volumes from the successful launch of a new card in the second half of 2019. Now excluding that impact, our volumes and card would better reflect the underlying market. I also want to let you know now that going forward, we do not intend to provide this level of volume detail. We introduced these slides in response to the severe impact of the pandemic on financial services. Given the relative stability in the market, and hopefully, the early stages of recovery, we will return to our normal disclosure practices beginning with the first quarter of 2021. Now let's spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the vertical. So beginning with consumer lending, it continued to recover during the quarter, as larger FinTech lenders slowly returned to customer acquisition, fueled by solid levels of investor commitment to funding loans. Consumer demand remains tepid. As low credit card balances, cash out refinancings and stimulus payments have reduced the demand for certain installment products like debt consolidation and short-term loans. On the other hand, we continue to see significant growth with point-of-sale lenders both from their own success as well as share gains. Auto lending was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, as new car sales picked up while the used car market tightened as inventory levels remain challenge. As digital auto retailing grows, we continue to see demand for our prequalification solutions, including auto payment shopper. And positively, we also have seen some early signs of lenders returning to marketing activities as their portfolios stabilized. The credit card market remains fairly stable as the industry showed modest signs of recovery from the sharp declines in the second quarter. We also continue to see a slow recovery in marketing and believe that there is considerable pent up consumer demand that should fuel this category in the future. Now I want to spend a minute taking a slightly deeper dive on our mortgage business, which delivered outstanding growth in 2020 on the strength of both refinancing and home purchase activities as interest rates remain historically low. On this chart, you can see the incredible growth in the market app over these last two years, creating a very challenging stack of comparisons as we enter 2021. As always, we have spent considerable time with our customers and advisory boards, while also incorporating an array of public data to develop our outlook for the market this year. Based on this rigorous work, we believe that the mortgage market will decline about 10% in 2021. More specifically, we anticipate continued strengthen mortgage in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter and then weaker second half as volumes taper off and comparisons remain very challenging. Now we will update you if our view changes as the year unfolds. I want to wrap up though with a quick view of our financial services sales pipeline. Despite the impact of the pandemic on our markets, our sales team delivered exceptionally strong results. Our healthy pipeline reflects our effective customer engagement and highly relevant product offerings, including a substantial number of credit visual wins that demonstrate the long runway for the solution. For the full year, we increased our new wins in dollars by almost 40% behind a win rate that's just shy of 50%. We attribute the success to the nimble changes our sales teams made to conduct business virtually along with our thought leadership that provided tangible assistance to customers and of course the strength and breadth of our product portfolio. And now shifting to our U.S. emerging verticals. Most of them saw trends generally improved or at least stabilized during the fourth quarter. Beginning with healthcare performance played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Front-end volumes continued to slowly recover, as providers saw outpatient volumes returned to pre-COVID levels. In-patient visits remain depressed but stable as patients showed caution about returning to the healthcare venues. Emergency Department continued to show weaker but stable trends. The impact of reduced front-end volumes negatively affects the back-end of the business resulting in a reduced number of potential coverage discovery opportunities. Despite the headwinds that we faced, the vertical only declined mid single-digits for the full year reflecting the importance of our offerings. And even if the U.S. Healthcare System lost more than $320 billion in 2020, we saw solid levels of new business wins last year. As our business helps providers recover cash, we remain well positioned to help healthcare providers protect their revenue and balance sheets. And as we look forward, we see no structural change to this market, such that we won't return to a more steady growth profile post-pandemic. Now shifting to insurance. This vertical defined slightly in the fourth quarter, as we had a modestly more challenging comparison than in the third quarter. However, the vertical delivered growth for the full year as a result of our successful diversification into areas such as commercial auto, life, group life and other types of property and casualty insurance. Notably, we realized significant growth in our sales pipeline with new business won in \u201820, exceeding our strong 2019 levels. Many of the deals involved multi product wins, reflecting our attractive suite of products. In our partnership with Neuro-ID began to generate revenue. As a reminder, Neuro-ID helps customers understand biometric behavior during the online application, providing insight into potential fraud based on how consumers enter data. The solution uses the same data to explain why consumers abandon applications, so processes can be refined. As online applications increase in insurance, this partnership positions us to capitalize on that trend. And public sector grew significantly as most government agencies operate as business as usual, providing meeting necessary support for their constituents. We posted strong new sales in the quarter at the State and Federal levels and also increased our opportunity pipeline. Our media vertical grew both on a reported and organic basis as we continue to make meaningful progress against the strategy I highlighted earlier. We also delivered growth in our screening business, which includes both tenant and employment screening. We saw solid performance in tenant screening as leasing companies remain active in our SmartMove screening product made additional inroads in the marketplace. Employment screening remains depressed as it mirrors employment trends. And the telco market recovered largely as we expected with consumers returning to more normal device purchasing levels. And finally, although collections is counter-cyclical over time, we don't expect any uptick in the near future as loan forbearance programs and collections moratoriums delay demand. Further, government payments during the pandemic has helped many consumers to stay current on their loans or reduce their debt loads. Now moving to consumer interactive, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in our direct business due to increased advertising and higher conversion rates on our -- to our subscription products. Consumers continue to value our credit health and identity protection services. Our indirect channel remains soft as financial products lead aggregators has experienced diminished demand from the lenders they serve for new client acquisition. Reduced acquisition levels has caused some of our clients to cut back on their own marketing causing a decline in their subscribers and negatively impacting our revenues, a portion of which are based on subscriber levels. Although the standard -- this dynamic is now stabilized and we are seeing some recovery it created a growth headwind for our business in 2020. Wrapping up with our international segment, let's look at revenue trends which illustrate the ongoing recovery across our geographic footprint. Generally, successful re-openings have allowed economies to restart, leading to increase overall economic activity. However, as we've all seen, the duration in the durability of re-openings varies greatly market-to-market. At the same time, our team's done an outstanding job partnering with customers to assist them in managing through the impacts of the pandemic. You'll hear about new products, new business wins and creative ways that we deliver thought leadership. Now, let me turn to the specifics for each region. In the U.K., we returned to growth, excluding the impact of a divestment earlier in the year. While lending markets remained depressed, they did improve in the fourth quarter, particularly for mortgage. As in previous quarters, the alternative lending market continues to see pressure. Though the burgeoning buy-now pay-later space has provided a source of growth as we hold a strong leadership position. Our fraud in gaming and gambling positions also showed further improvement and setting the stage for future growth. We have eight contracts with one of the U.K. is the largest lenders to provide them, the credit view platform and our open banking solution. Now our Canadian business grew again in the fourth quarter, despite generally weak lending markets and continually escalating COVID mitigation restrictions. Our good performance reflects the meaningful portfolio diversification that we've intentionally developed including insurance and public sector expansion, direct-to-consumer offerings and growth in the emerging FinTech market. And in India, the country has now fully reopened, resulting in slowly improving transaction volumes, including very strong volumes during the [valley], which typically drives the strongest business of the year. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio as well as specific programs to address critical pandemic driven issues. For instance, we extended our string of significant business wins supporting the Indian government, as they work with lenders, small businesses and consumers to provide incremental oversight and stimulus during pandemic. We also engaged with our FinTech customers, by setting up our innovation lab on the cloud and inviting them to compete with our developers to see who can deliver the best performing models. And through our TGIF or TransUnion Great Insights Fridays, we've had interactions with more than 300 discrete lenders bringing them important insights about the market consumers in their own businesses. As we look ahead, India remains a singularly vibrant and innovative market with significant growth potential for years to come. As the lending market transitions from traditional products, the high velocity, short-term low dollar loans, we expect hundreds of millions of Indians to enter the credit economy. And in the case of small businesses only about $10 million of the $60 million currently have loans. These changes have meaningful implications for TransUnion's addressable market and we remain extremely well positioned to benefit from them. In Latin America, we serve a variety of markets and most remain somewhat stable, albeit at depressed levels compared to last year. Notably, Colombia delivered a solid quarter of growth on the strength of our FinTech insurance and telco businesses. As we've discussed previously we expect to slow and long linear recovery in many of these markets. In Asia Pacific, the market in Hong Kong has stabilized so generally depressed levels as the fall-out from the pandemic and political unrest continues. We returned to growth on the strength of our re-launched direct-to-consumer offer. We expected to provide a meaningful source of growth in \u201821 likely exceeding the previous revenue run rate over time. Now rounding up APAC, the Philippines continues to face significant headwinds, as the country has struggled reopened, impacting consumers and our customers. Our team held its first lending summit to bring more sophisticated thought leadership to the market. Even as we roll-out credit vision which provides a superior tool for our customers to assess lending risk, particularly in this current environment. Longer term, we remained confident in optimistic that the Philippines will return to attractive growth. The South African economy remains challenged, particularly with the second wave of COVID spread causing further lockdowns recently. As in other markets, our team has responded by prioritizing our customers' needs, like account management collections in ecommerce. They have successfully expanded uptake of key solutions, such as CreditVision, TruValidate and digital on-boarding to drive value for customers. Now, just taking you through how TransUnion has managed effectively through the global pandemic, while also accelerating investments that set up our path to what is possible. So I'll now turn it over to Todd to walk you through our financial results in detail and our first quarter and full year 2021 guidance. So over to you Todd. Well, thank you, Todd. And to conclude this morning, you've heard more about the meaningful progress we've made in fundamentally improving TransUnion to Project Rise, Global Operations and Solutions. Each delivers immense value to TransUnion over the long-term, and in tandem, they have an even greater potential to help us sustain industry leading top line growth and an attractive and growing margin. At the same time, our business continues to perform well in the midst of some very challenging conditions. I'll end by reiterating I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. And thank you for joining us this morning. So with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron. Yes, good morning, Manav. So as I commented before, I think \u201821 will be a bit of a mixed bag, the first half and the second half will be different. The first half is likely to be choppier just given the state of the public health situation. But in markets like the U.S. as vaccines are rolled-out and I think the population returns to health, you'll see a material strengthening across the different verticals in which we compete. And that leads to a stronger second half. And also I expect that we will roll with some good momentum into 2022. And start to compound the top line, in a manner consistent with what we have done previously. That's certainly the aspiration at this point. I would say that mortgage remains the critical wildcard here, over the course of \u201821. As Todd just said, we are modeling in about a 10% decline in the category. And it has swelled [30%] of our revenue, so it's more material than previous. With that said, nobody's crystal ball is perfect. And it is quite material to the financial results that we've outlined in our guidance this morning. So the best I can tell you is, one we provided more detail into how we arrived at the number than we typically would and will ongoing. And two, if we see a material change in our assumptions, we'll certainly communicate with the market quickly because we will have a direct bearing on the results. And then the last thing I would say is look as our economy heals from the pandemic, we start to get back to normal. And I take more of a global perspective here, there are key components of our portfolio that will return to health and growth that have been somewhat uniquely impacted in the pandemic. The first comes in our consumer direct business where 60% of the revenues are focused on providing reports and analytics to indirect players, the marketing lead aggregators for financial services. And as lenders pulled out of the market in terms of client acquisition, their businesses were materially impacted and that became quite a headwind for us. Additionally, as you know we have strong and disproportionate market share in the FinTech space and in consumer lending and that was also an area that I think was the hardest hit of the different financial services verticals in the U.S. And then finally, our international portfolio, which has over $600 million now was a consistent double-digit compound grower. And those three things have been muted, somewhat because of the pandemic. They're all stable now and they're all resuming growth. But again, as the global health situation improves and the pandemic recedes, you're going to see acceleration in those three components, as well as the other piece parts of our portfolio. And I think we're well positioned for recovery. And again, I guess just one concluding remark, if you look at the guidance that we have provided where we've broken out the financial services performance and then attempted to isolate the mortgage component within that, but then also highlighted the growth rates across our emerging verticals portfolio in the U.S., you can see that we're really expecting quite a bit of strengthening across the vast majority of our portfolio in \u201821, some very attractive, high single-digits organic growth rates, but again somewhat muted by the mortgage headwind and the general uncertainty in that category. So I'll pause there Todd, if you want to add anything? Yes, so, I mean, look, Manav, you have touched on a really good question. So the way I think about how we resumed the growth that the markets come to expect from us, it really breaks down into four buckets. The first is that as the pandemic recedes, the underlying geographies and verticals that we serve are going to heal and there's nothing structural that's changed there. Two, will also resume the momentum from our product portfolio that was -- that represents all the investment in innovation that we've accumulated, right? We've got a strong -- we have many generations of product development that are still in the early-to-mid stages of adoption, this market heals, you're going to see those driving growth. On top of it and again, referencing the point Todd just made, we've got other vintages of growth that we're layering on. One is the repositioning of our [fraud] business, which we'll talk -- we've talked about in some detail, where we're bringing together the multiple fraud assets that we've acquired in creating a single global fraud growth platform focused on the most global segments for our business. We've also invested a lot in data analytics and modeling tools via Prama, we're launching the employment verification in income, vector, we continue to add new data types. And look, there's a multitude of growth categories in addition to what we've done in the media that represents the third component. And again, as always we remain active looking for complimentary M&A internationally we're always hopeful we can find geographies that we can enter. And specifically we can really improve the operations of the credit bureau. And in the U.S. really to fuel our global product development and then we're looking to add capabilities that compliment the needs that we're servicing in our clients. So potentially more than you bargained for, but that's, that's our thoroughly answer. Yes, sure, Toni. I mean, obviously, this is a really exciting extension, to our product portfolio. And we think we can differentiate by really streamlining access to the credit and the employment and income verification through a common digital connection, right really leveraging the pathways that was established already. But as you know, from my comments, last time around, I tried to caution the market that, this is not a category that we're going to achieve parity with the market leader in one quarter, this is a entry into an area that is strategically important and complimentary, that we're going to put with full weight of our product resources and innovation behind developing a product that really can compete, but that will take time. In the interim, we're in a phase where we are productizing, the data and the pipeline relationships that we've established via , the large payroll processor in MX Technologies. And you're right, Toni, over time, our focus is going to be on broader and broader market coverage, which means you've got to establish more relationships. And then market coverage will be both with payroll processors, potentially other types of data providers, and these financial aggregators that will allow us to cascade broad market coverage across banks FinTech's, and credit providers. So we're in this for the long haul, we're just -- I'm just not able right now to give you like financial precision on dollar or growth rates. But look, as you know, this is a really big market. I love the competitive dynamics, I love the fact that we can pull together an offering. And we can start attacking and learning and gaining share. And that's our intention. Yes, good question, Gary. the first thing I would say is that, in terms of attrition for whatever reasons, there's no change that we're aware of, right. And so there's nothing to really counteract that increase in the estimated annual contract value of the deals that we closed in \u201820. Now, revenue arrival is a different [annual] than contracted sales. And it varies based on variety of factors. One is the time it's going to take to integrate to the clients and establish those relationships and in certain cases, how long it takes them to incorporate their data or render our data into their models either marketing or origination or collections, et cetera. So there can be a lag time. Related to that there can also be some time until clients ramped to their full volume potential. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that sometimes salespeople can be overly enthusiastic with the potential deal, size of the deal. Although I can't give you any evidence that their enthusiasm -- their enthusiasm has changed over the course of the pandemic. So look, a 40% increase in dollar close doesn't lead to a 40% increase in the new portion of our revenues in the coming year. But it is a really tremendous indication of the health of our product line, our sales efforts and our client's health as well. And the other thing I would just mention is that, new wins represent a new layer of revenue that we're laying upon a deep and established foundation. And it's really the volume movements in the foundation have a much more material impact on our revenue in the coming year or in the current period than does the increment, right. So I'll just pause there. Yes, sure. Well, up to your point, the media market or the market for digital advertising services is enormous and varied. We have chosen kind of a surgical entry into a portion of that market, where I feel that our matching logic in some differentiated data provides us with an advantage with an opportunity to introduce a best-in-class solution. Now before we had a media vertical, we were supporting different various ad tech companies in matching online and offline data because TransUnion and the Bureau's in general are just really good at that. And we know that our matching logic is superior to the standard that prevails in that marketplace. And so with that experience and that insight we decided to formalize the offering into a specific vertical offering. As we started to gain more experience we realized that we needed to deliver our data, all of our customer identifying data, demographic and segmentation type of data on a different platform with a user friendly access. So immediate clients can come in and slice and dice and create the audiences that they were interested in. And then we can append the digital identity and other offline, characterizing information that they could use to drive their advertising campaigns. When we bought Tru Optik, though we gained a differentiated data set because they are one of the early leaders in the market to provide insight as to which homes are consuming content via which streaming devices via video or audio, right. And so now we have differentiated data sets that we can add to our universe of data in our segmentation tool. And then also combine that with our matching, practical example of it is an advertiser can find out now that a particular home address mine or yours, as Apple TV has Netflix, uses Hulu, et cetera. But they don't know much about the household. With TransUnion, we can do that matching and say that the occupants of the household has certain characteristics, maybe a demographic, care -- just a whole range of kind of marketing, characterizing and segmenting variables. So again, it's our narrow and surgical focus into a portion of this market where I think we're upping the game. That's our value proposition. And that's why we're confident we can achieve growth. Yes, thanks for the question, Shlomo. Yes, it is a strong business that continues to deliver neither nice growth across all of our markets. As you know from my prior commentary, it's a business that's composed of variety of piece parts, some of which are overlapping or redundant as you look at the different geographies that we serve. And so part of what we're trying to do is or what we have done is we've looked across our portfolio and we said what are the best-in-class within TransUnion product components that we have and how do we integrate those on top of this single product platform with orchestration, with case management, with all of the different reporting and measurement controls that you would like. And look, the ultimate integration around an enterprise architecture, any single product platform, that's going to happen over a period of time because that's heavy lifting engineering type of work, right. And the need to do the work is just a function of the fact that the business developed in the U.S., it developed internationally, we acquire innovation, we acquired a really nice and fast growing business in call credit. And frankly, when you talk about integration there's multiple levels from the kind of more surface to the deep and foundational and we're committed to doing all of it. The next thing is really just a function of the market segments that we're prioritizing. So different types of customers have different fraud needs. And we have a particular strength serving those market segments where they are initiating a relationship, a financial relationship of some nature, where the magnitude of the transactions and the risk associated with transactions over the term of the relationship is going to be somewhat significant. And therefore, the upfront customer identification, device verification and just the general authentication process will take a little bit of time, will be triangulated from multiple different points. Because it's really important to know who you're dealing with, the counterparty you're dealing with and have confidence in that. And so we're focused on that part of the market. And again, this is an enormous and multifaceted market because we have, a great constellation of products that comes together to serve it most effectively. And so that will get most of the focus for our product development. Now that said, we also -- we successfully compete for business, in other segments where what you really need is a super fast, but more superficial level of authentication based on device history, perhaps geo-location and on-site behavior, right. And that could be an ecommerce based retail transaction, where you got really material share, et cetera. But think of those transactions are different from establishing a relationship with a lender or, on-site gaming or gambling where there's just a lot of dollars flowing. So to be successful, we got to concentrate our resources in a particular segment. As we've pulled together these different assets, we've come to appreciate the segments -- the segmentation landscape, if you will, at a more granular level. We will continue to serve the market in its entirety. It's just the product development focus will be more around the segments I described. And those customers that are really looking for broad, authoritative solutions, which we possess, but also assistance from their provider in implementing and configuring the solutions to get best results. Yes, it's a good question. Yes, I think global operations and global solutions and the later solutions, if you really think of this vector product management layer within TransUnion. They're delivering benefits already. However, as I've mentioned, we're aggressively investing in new product development and entering new markets and also in operational streamlining and automation and all of those things. So we're using some of the early benefits that we're getting from those initiatives to cell phones and accelerate the implementations of full global programs that are going to free up a lot of resources that we will then invest in both product development to accelerate and really secure high single-digit or top line compounding that we aspire to, but also delivering margin improvements to the business. Collectively, Project Rise are the technology retooling the operations and solutions. They are going to have really material impact on how effectively we operate in the market and having spent a year strategizing and implementing which was \u201820 and now going into \u201821, and really accelerate the implementation. I'm really excited in increasing the confidence of the positive impact we're going to have. Yes, good. So I think what you're asking Kevin is, how is the current wave of tech innovation? That's coming out of products, Project Spark, we can call Project Rise and the migration of the cloud and the, standardization around an enterprise architecture, all of that. And the short answer is that, it will definitely speed to market new product ideas, right? Because one will be leveraging IP globally and two by utilizing the public cloud, there's a lot of utility functionality around the acquisition, the care and the maintenance of underlying hardware and connectivity and even security infrastructure that we will purchases and service. There's also components to software development that we can acquire directly from our cloud service providers as services. And so the technology new product development for TransUnion becomes more focused on those areas of unique IP and value add that we bring, as diversified information services provider anchored in credit and all of the unique insights we have around the vertical market needs."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Hoffman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go, ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ve posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with their corresponding reconciliations with these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today\u2019s call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings release and the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Now with that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. At TransUnion, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. Globally, almost every one of our 8,000 employees continued to work from home. A select number of associates have continued to work on-site to ensure our technology infrastructure operates uninterrupted. I want to thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. Other than these critical employees, we see no need to rush back into our offices, as our associates have demonstrated the flexibility to work remotely and run our business with virtually no interruption. In fact, during the third quarter, we conducted a companywide survey of our associates and confirmed that they largely prefer to remain remote at this time and can work at very high levels, while doing so. Now on our last call, I talked about my personal commitment to making TransUnion a more diverse and inclusive company. I want to give you an update on our progress. First, we\u2019ve appointed Teedra Bernard as our first ever Head of Talent and Diversity. In this role, Teedra\u2019s responsibilities include talent acquisition, employment branding, on-boarding associate and manager training, leadership development, career development, employee engagement and employee relations. By lining all of these functions under Teedra\u2019s leadership will ensure a diversity and inclusion lens is brought to all of our human capital management decisions. Secondly, we launched a taskforce, which we call Total Impact, which combines all our efforts to support racial equity and social justice and to connect these efforts through and for our associates, our culture and our operating model. This task force will amplify our consumer advocacy and outreach by offering tools and support, and at increasing access to economic opportunity. They will examine the role our data and products play in the financial ecosystem in order to promote greater financial inclusion. The task force has already made progress to ensure that customers use our data responsibly and in line with our mission to promote equal access to economic and other opportunities. And related to this work, we continue to engage with US regulators about how we can promote greater financial inclusion and participation. Finally, we remain committed to training our top leaders to increase their understanding and awareness of racial and equity. During the quarter, they participated in a session on getting comfortable talking about race and equity. We then asked all managers across the globe to attend a three-part series to learn more about race, bias and how they build more inclusive team. Nearly 2000 managers have participated in this important session. It\u2019s important to note that these actions represent only a starting point and we remain committed to making meaningful long-term changes at TransUnion. And we have also given our associates November 3 off to help them exercise their right to vote. Regardless of party affiliation and political views, we encourage our associates to get out and vote. Now, I would like to layout the agenda for this morning\u2019s call. First, I will provide you with the details about our performance in the third quarter and the trends and dynamics that underpinned our ability to achieve our upside case outlook. I\u2019ll also discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and how we continue to support our customers and consumers during this crisis. You will hear a consistent story of adapting our go-to-market approach, our product offerings and solutions to address the current market conditions. Then I\u2019ll provide an update on the progress we will made with our global solutions, global operations and Project Rise. I will also discuss our recent media acquisitions and how together do they form the foundation of another attractive vertical. Finally, I will turn the time over to Todd to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. We have decided to reinstate formal guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year, albeit with a wider than normal range of expectations. And he will provide those details as well. Despite our restored comfort in providing guidance, I want to stress that we continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and the macro environment across the US and around the world in the markets in which we compete. We recognize that there is ongoing risk to the economic reopening based on the severity of the pandemic, and also the degree of stimulus being provided to consumers in each of those markets. So, shifting to financial services, let\u2019s look at the key trends in that market. I want to start by reviewing the online transaction volumes for financial services in the US, which is our largest vertical market. Volumes improved during the quarter with ongoing strength in mortgage and auto, with improvement in consumer lending, but offset by a very challenging comparison in our card business. I\u2019ll talk a little bit more about each of these in the next slide. Before I do, I want to emphasize that the impact of our sales effectiveness programs and innovation, using our US financial services vertical as an example, our new sales pipeline has improved this year by 8%, reflecting robust sales activity and an engaged customer base. Our win rate has increased by 5 percentage points, year-over-year and this has led to an impressive 43% gain in win dollars compared to the same period in 2019. Now taken together, this reflects greater sales efficiency, a focused strategy, a larger average win side and of course, strong execution across the board. We transitioned our teams to virtual selling supported by investments in a fellow training program, new collaboration technologies, an increase in improvement in our digital content and the deployment of internal experts to operate more effectively in the current environment. And throughout my remarks, you will hear about products across verticals in geographies that are meeting the needs of our customers in these current market conditions. Now let\u2019s spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the verticals. So to continue with FS, I want to start by talking with the health of the US consumer overall. Over the past six months, consumer balance sheets improved and that should support the long-term health of the economy and our business. In fact, since the onset of COVID, bank deposits reached record levels and the personal savings rate doubled. At the same time, delinquencies generally remained flat or even down for some lending products. A number of factors contributed to this. The significant government stimulus provided additional liquidity to consumers. At the same time, lender forbearance programs alleviated the needs for many consumers to pay their mortgages, allowing them to stay current on other debts to pay down existing debts or simply save more money. And finally, the mortgage refinancing boom allows consumers to save hundreds of dollars each month, which again they can save or use to stay current on their obligations. This demonstrates the importance of government support and the potential impact on consumers as of to-date. So with that as a backdrop, let\u2019s turn to mortgage. Both refinancing and home purchase activity remain very strong throughout the third quarter on the strength of our historically low interest rates. The cyclical strength in mortgage certainly helped our result. But we remain cognizant that the cycle will run its course in 2021, and create some challenging comparisons. The current MBA outlook calls for mortgage volumes to decline 23% next year, while Fannie Mae\u2019s forecast a 38% decline. In either case, we would expect the preponderance of the impact to occur later in the year. Now auto financing held up low in the quarter as low rates and attractive financing offers stimulated shopping activity in both the new and the used car markets. As our customers shifted to more digital acquisition channels, we won new business for our pre-qualification programs. Looking ahead, tight inventory levels of both new and used cars resulted in constrained industry volumes. Additional market growth will likely require increases in production as well as used vehicle supply from trade-in and auctions to meet the current heightened demand. And the credit card market improved slowly from the dramatic declines we saw between late March through July, notably insurance began to test marketing campaigns to determine how best to reach end market to consumers in the current environment. While marketing volumes remain down year-over-year, they have shown positive trends and we believe they will continue to improve. For our business, as noted on this chart, we are comparing against our participation in a highly successful launch of a new credit card in the third quarter of last year. Excluding that impact, our results would better reflect the underlying market. Finally, consumer lending continued to recover during the quarter as larger FinTech lenders slowly returned to customer acquisition fueled by fall-out levels of investor commitment to funding loans. In particular, we continue to see significant growth with point of sale lenders both from their own success as well as share gains. We expect this subset of the FinTech space to benefit from the very strong holiday season with a likely dramatic increase in online shopping. Across our end markets, we see two themes emerge with lenders. The first relates to their ability to adapt their models to understand the impact of the pandemic on consumers, leading to new sales of CreditVision Acute Relief attributes to help them better assess their current portfolios. And we are seeing meaningful traction in acquiring new users of both CreditVision and CreditVision Link as a means to improve their models for future customer acquisition. The second trend builds on the accelerated transition to digital commerce, resulting in a heightened interest in online fraud mitigation solutions like iovation and the spirit of very substantial conversations around digital marketing, the topic I am going to discuss a bit more later. Now on to our emerging verticals, across most of our emerging verticals, we saw trends improve during the third quarter. Beginning with healthcare, our business continues to face headwinds as the pandemic has an idiosyncratic effect on our healthcare system. Performance played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Front-end patient volumes recovered as provider saw increases that continue to improve the trend toward pre-COVID levels. However ongoing declines for inpatient care particularly for elected procedures as patients remain cautious about returning to healthcare facilities partially offset the improvement in outpatient volume. Similarly, emergency department visits remain depressed. The impact of reduced volumes negatively impacts the back end of the business, resulting in a reduced number of potential coverage discovery opportunities. This all factors against the backdrop of increased financial pressure on those healthcare systems as our business helps providers recover cash, we remain somewhat insulated from the full impact of weaker volumes in the healthcare system. And as we look forward, we see no structural change to this market, such that we will return to a more steady growth profile post-pandemic. Now shifting to insurance, this vertical returned to modest growth in the third quarter. As industry volumes stabilized, we continue to realize success with innovative products like our national driving record solution, which combines drivers risk as a pre-screen for the presence of a motor vehicle violation with our ability to resell state-issued motor vehicle reports. This creates efficiencies for auto insurers. We also continue to benefit from diversification into commercial auto, life and other aspects of property and casualty insurance. And our public sector market grew again as most government agencies continue to operate business as usual providing necessary support for their constituents. Additionally, we gained some business related to the COVID pandemic in fraud mitigation and identification for individuals requesting support from government. We also delivered growth in our screening business, which includes both tenant and employment screening. We saw solid performance in tenant screening as leasing companies remained active and our SmartMove screening product made additional inroads to the marketplace. Employment screening remains depressed as it mirrors employment trends. We offset some of the negative impacts with a successful campaign focused on small business acquisitions, which we provided our ShareAble for Hires tool free for an introductory period. We are now seeing payoff as many new users have converted to the paid product and the telco market continues to improve with the reopening of retail stores and its consumers resume more \u2013 a more normal purchasing cadence. Finally, while we believe collections is countercyclical and will be over time, we don\u2019t expect to see any significant uptick until at least the beginning of 2021, as forbearance programs and state-imposed moratoriums on collections continue to delay activity. As I mentioned earlier, government subsidies delayed some collections activities as they enable consumers to pay off debts or stay current leading to lower delinquencies and default. Now, turning to Consumer Interactive, we delivered solid revenue growth in this segment, as consumers and customers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring and related financial education tools like those that we offer both directly and indirectly, through our partners. In the quarter, we saw direct channel revenue accelerate behind continued successful marketing to consumers, focused on their credit health. On the other hand some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, resulting in a decline in subscribers. This caused a slightly larger decline in this portion of our business compared to the second quarter and we expect that to persist in future quarters. At the same time, though, we continue to engage with potential indirect partners about new long-term opportunities. Now moving on to our International segment, let\u2019s look at revenue trends, which illustrates the ongoing recovery across all reported regions and countries. Generally, successful re-openings have allowed economy to restart leading to increased overall economic activity. I would note that the degree of reopening varies greatly across our markets. For example, Brazil has never shutdown while the Philippines recently started to emerge from the second complete closure. India took a more phased approach \u2013 approach and the entire country only recently fully reopened. And in the UK, we see the potential for isolated closures as COVID cases have spiked in certain areas. And of course, we continue to monitor all these situations closely. Now, let\u2019s spend a few minutes on each region where you\u2019ll see a common theme of partnering with our customers to help them navigate the pandemic, optimize leveraging our innovation in CreditVision, CreditView, IDVision and other of our solutions. In the UK, thus far, government stimulus helped consumers manage through the crisis. However, the salary protection provided by the government will diminish from 80% coverage to about 57% coverage and only for areas with local lockdown at the end of October, shifting the burden to employers who may reduce their workforces. And during the fourth quarter, the payment holidays for mortgage and other loans will wind down. These actions may impact the already soft lending market. For our business, we continue to see an exaggerated weakness in the alternative lending market where we hold sizable market share. We also divested a small business earlier in the year, which negatively impacted our growth rate. Todd will provide more information about this later. Successful COVID mitigation business helped offset some of the weakness in the market. That included business with the UK government, the rollout of the TrueVision transitional risk index to help lenders identify consumers who pose a risk of default in the future as well as a number of wins for CreditView including with NatWest, one of the largest lenders in the UK. Our fraud mitigation business continues to deliver solid results and we\u2019ve seen a recovery in our online gaming and gambling vertical as sports resumed around the world. Our Canadian business grew in the third quarter despite generally weak lending markets. At this time, various aspects of government stimulus are expected to continue. Our good performance reflects the meaningful portfolio of diversification that we\u2019ve intentionally developed. We saw double digit growth in insurance and direct to consumer as well as a strong performance in the nascent FinTech markets. At the same time, we successfully introduced the credit version of CreditVision Acute Relief and a Vulnerability Index both to assist lenders in better understanding the state of their consumers. In India, the country slowly reopened and our volumes have mirrored that. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio, as well as specific programs to address critical pandemic driven issues. For instance, we supported Indian government\u2019s efforts to provide stimulus to small businesses by tightening the market and helping them identify who should receive the support. The Indian government also turned to us to help understand how individual lenders handled forbearance arrangements. We successfully launched a simplified version of our scores and algorithms using CreditVision for FinTech lenders, who in India tend to provide small ticket, very short duration loans. And we continued to deliver valuable insights to our customers. We recently began a weekly thought leadership session called TGIF or TransUnion\u2019s Great Insights Friday, where we can bring our customers together virtually and help them work through the impacts of the pandemic. Now in Latin America, we served a variety of markets and most improved from the second quarter. Chile performed relatively well on the strength of its modern, highly digitized economy. Colombia also delivered and improved performance as our customers increased their digital products consumption to meet consumer needs during the shutdown. Other markets saw more modest improvement, reflecting the limited level of government stimulus in some markets. And in Hong Kong, the market has stabilized. Recently, we won new business for our fraud mitigation tools related to digital on-boarding. We saw improvement in our relaunch direct to consumer portal as well as some new opportunities for our CreditView platform. Rounding out APAC, the Philippines continue to face significant headwinds as the country just recently began to reopen from a second complete shutdown. We expect a slow recovery there. And the South African economy remains challenged with GDP expected to decline 9% and consumers and small businesses strained despite an influx of nearly $3 billion of government stimulus. We generated momentum in our business behind CreditVision tools for portfolio review as well as IDVision and seamless onboarding to support our customers\u2019 transition to more digital consumption. Our business has maintained a sharp focus on serving our customers and delivering good results in the quarter, we also continued to invest for our future with differentiated programs and approaches to sustain our industry leadership. On our last earnings call, I detailed our global operations and global solutions organizations, as well as our investment in Project Rise. I will update each of those areas today and I will also highlight our investments to build out our media vertical. Now moving to global operations, this area allows us to expand our core capabilities through centralization, optimizing processes and automating them, leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that we will reinvest in new growth projects. I wanted to highlight our progress in this area over the past three months. First in global procurements, we have renegotiated a number of our largest supplier agreements to better focus our spend and leverage that to achieve more favorable terms. We have already realized some initial savings and cost avoidance and I expect that to increase over time. Our negotiations also included adding new features or services to facilitate growth across the enterprise. Second, we intend to replicate the success of our global capability center in Chennai, India, which was recently named one of the 50 Best Workplaces for Women in India by The Great Place to Work Institute. While we continue to add seats in Chennai, by the end of this year, we will open the second location in India in Pune. This location will focus primarily on Project Rise and other significant technology initiatives. Finally, we continue to make progress on reengineering the customer experience. We are implementing new tools that allow us to better understand our customers and to make TransUnion easier to do business with. We remain confident that global operations will deliver significant efficiency and cost benefits that we will both reinvest and return to shareholders, while also furthering our market leadership through improved customer engagement. Now, let me update you on the progress in Global Solutions, which allows us to strategically develop and diffuse innovative products across the more than 30 geographies in which we compete. In recent months, we made significant progress on two partnerships to develop a more comprehensive view of consumers that we can leverage to help our customers make smarter decisions about customer acquisition and risk management. First, we partnered with MX, let me say it again, it\u2019s M like Mike and like Xerox to afford avoid any confusion with the large card issuer. We partnered with MX to incorporate consumer contributed data into our solutions. MX aggregates financial information through customer permission connectivity with banks and credit unions and FinTech innovators on more than 30 million consumers. Through this partnership in both the US and Canada, TransUnion will be able to, will enable consumers to enrich their credit profile, help lenders make better, more informed decisions. And ultimately, consumers will benefit from access to better products and services. For lenders, the near-term used cases, we will explore include income verification and the creation of new account derived attributes that will offer visibility into a consumer\u2019s ability to pay. In the spirit of leveraging our global capabilities, the solutions team already began coordinating with our UK business where we provide the industry leading affordability suite of solutions and a best-in-class open-banking platform. Both of these capabilities lend themselves to the work with MX and our influence into consumer permission data. MX identified similar solutions in other international markets allowing us to coalesce around this opportunity on the global basis. And we have made a minor equity investment and formed a commercial partnership agreement with FinLocker, which allows consumers to collect and permission their financial information needed to secure a mortgage among other loan types. Consumers maintain control of their information throughout the process and can utilize educational resources to help prepare them for the mortgage application process as well as take advantage of personal lines financial health dashboard something that present homebuyers find appealing. Importantly, FinLocker utilizes banking industry multilayer security like data encryption and application protection to safeguard consumer information. FinLocker also helps lenders better service their existing customers by finding the right products to offer based on the individuals\u2019 unique needs while supporting their financial journey to help drive a stronger relationship and reduce the lenders costs. Lenders can offer leverage FinLocker for lead nurturing and conversions or getting deeper insights into consumers\u2019 actions and behaviors, making smarter risk decisions and then covering new opportunities to drive growth. Through this partnership, we will offer our marketing and portfolio review solutions to mortgage originators and servicers, providing them with an end-to-end offering. We will also have distribution rights with FinLocker and will explore expanding beyond the mortgage vertical. Now both of these partnerships provide valuable new avenues for growth and by far fully putting together these pieces, we positioned ourselves to begin to offer a broader view of consumers, helping our customers make better decisions through superior insights. At the same time, we can help consumers experience more seamless credit journey. We are still in the early stages of this strategy, but you can see a clear and attractive path in front of us as we fully anticipate that in the finding additional opportunities for these technologies and data in the future. Now to the media vertical, as we have explained in the past, our vertical strategy provides us with a valuable source of sustained differentiated growth. In recent years, we have built out our capabilities organically and through acquisitions to fuel public sector, telecommunications and our screening verticals for example. Over a longer term horizon, we did the same thing to build our nearly $200 million healthcare vertical and our similarly sized insurance vertical. Most recently, we have applied to playbook to build a media vertical focused primarily on digital marketing-related solutions. We recognize that we had foundational pieces necessary to compete successfully in audience segmentation and identity resolution, two growing categories within the larger digital marketing ecosystem. Most notably, we possess a larger array of data and world-class data linking and managing logic. As such, we identified the intersection of the media industry and digital marketing as a market for our expansion. We moved purposely to acquire the capabilities needed to offer a robust portfolio of solutions over these past 18 months that can enable people based and identity enabled marketing. The first acquisition, TruSignal brought a modern cloud-based platform that marketers and media companies use to build and distribute precisely defined audience segments. Users can access this platform directly or through an integrated API within other technology platform. The second acquisition Signal, which we completed earlier this summer added two key offerings. First, the broad product that allows to work with our clients to structure and activate their own Audience Intelligence. Second, it provided a platform for real-time data collection and distribution to connected and complementary advertising and marketing technologies. And earlier this month, we acquired Tru Optik to round out our market position. Tru Optik deepens our understanding of connecting consumers via what they call a household identity graph, essentially a virtual map of the streaming video and audio devices within the home. This understanding of the connected home adds yet another dimension to our ability to match an individual to a broad array of data as well as persistent digital identifiers. Tru Optik with our focus on understanding the connected home and providing solutions for Connected TV as well as streaming audio had gotten ahead of the curve, related to the adoption of streaming media services and the future of TV advertising investments. Marketers turn to Tru Optik to select the homes they want to target for either streaming video or streaming audio campaign. The streaming media providers leveraged Tru Optik to enable to precision targeting that marketers expect. Narrowing all of the capabilities from these three acquisitions gives us an industry leading position within the clearly defined part of the media market, and we believe we can now deliver meaningful sustained growth. Additionally, to fully leverage this opportunity, we will report the digitally focused marketing capabilities across the U.S. markets and vertical portfolio. In fact in just a few weeks since we announced the acquisition, we have already engaged with a number of large financial institutions about using Tru Optik and over time we will also identify how best to extend these capabilities outside of the U.S. And finally, I would like to provide an update on Project Rise. I will start with a broad point, namely that effectively all roads in TransUnion lead back to technology as a core enabler. A lot of the work that we are doing in operations relies on technology. In the fourth quarter, we will migrate our consumer call center to the cloud, resulting in a better consumer experience and greater efficiency. The partnership I described in solutions benefit from the modern technology stack in Data Architecture that we have nurtured over the past 5 years and future progress relies on the evolve technology foundation that Project Rise will deliver. In the media vertical and digital solutions build out depends on the cloud capabilities, we\u2019re developing. Beyond that, we remain on track with our timeline, our anticipated investment and effectively time. In fact, in the fourth quarter our first proof of concept applications go live using the first set of Rise capabilities we developed as planned. We continue to see clear operational benefits in security, reliability, performance and efficiency as we progress through this transition to the cloud. As I wrap up my review of the business, I will reiterate the solid improvements we have seen in trends across our market aided by outstanding sales and product development efforts. And at the same time, we continue to aggressively invest to maintain our industry leadership and our attractive growth profile. And with that, I will pass it over to our CFO, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. As Chris highlighted, we achieved our upside case scenario for the third quarter, as we benefited from gradual improvement across almost all of our markets as well as the strength and diversity of our portfolio. I will start with our consolidated results and for the sake of simplicity all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the third quarter of 2019, unless noted otherwise. Starting with the income statement, third quarter consolidated revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, the Signal acquisition, which we completed during the quarter, had an immaterial impact on the growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.8%, down about 190 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter. Despite the decline, we still see this as a very good result given the significant challenges in the market. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. We benefited from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancings and lower LIBOR rates as well as a lower adjusted tax rate of 21.3%, which reflects our tax planning initiatives and a reduction in the Indian statutory rate. Now looking at the segment financial performance U.S. Markets revenue was up 4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Signal had an immaterial impact on the results. Our Financial Services vertical revenue grew 11%. As Chris discussed we saw improvement in all our lending end markets with considerable strength in mortgage and solid recovery in auto and consumer lending. Our card business faced challenging comps from our participation and a significant credit card launch in the year ago quarter. And to address the significant impact of mortgage in the quarter, excluding this cyclical growth, the vertical would have declined low-single digits, an acceleration in non-mortgage performance compared to the second quarter. I will reiterate my caution about the comparisons we may face in mortgage next year as they are likely to be a challenge. And it\u2019s worth noting that our mortgage business carries a particularly high margin, which will exasperate the impact of the tough comparisons whenever they come. Emerging Verticals combined declined 3% on a reported basis and 4% organically. Growth in public sector, media, tenant and employment screening and insurance help moderate declines in the other verticals. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% on both the reported and organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined about 260 basis points largely as a result of reserves for legal and regulatory matters that we took during the quarter. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue fell 7% as we saw trends improve in all of our regions, and as Chris discussed in detail. As we mentioned on our February call, we divested a small business in the UK with Recipero. Excluding that divestiture International would have been about 1 point better and our UK business would have been 3 points better. Adjusted EBITDA for International declined 8% in constant currency. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA for Consumer Interactive was up 1% as we continue to increase marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and see solid returns on that investment. As I had stressed over the past two quarters, we have a strong balance sheet and the ability to rapidly build cash. As a result of our attractive cash conversion and prudent steps to appropriately retain cash, we finished the quarter with $554 million of cash on the balance sheet and have not drawn down our $300 million revolving credit facility. The net of all of this, with that our leverage actually fell slightly from 3.0x at the end of the second quarter to 2.9x at the end of September. We will continue to take a prudent approach to cash retention but clearly have sufficient comfort that we were able to fund two acquisitions recently, and continue to be proactive in pursuit of additional attractive investment. As Chris previewed, we are reinstating formal guidance, replacing the scenario based outlooks that we provided for the past few quarters during what we hope will be the worst of the pandemic impact. As we have seen markets generally stabilize, we have sufficient visibility to take a more typical approach to guidance. However, recognizing the potential unknowns of the upcoming election and the recent increases in COVID-19 cases, we have provided a wider range between the low and high end of guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS compared to what we have done previously. For the fourth quarter revenue, we expect about 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik. There is also about 1 point of headwind to revenue and adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue should come in between $678 million and $698 million or a 1% decline to a 2% increase. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $255 million and $271 million, a decrease of 2% to 7%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.74 and $0.80, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 7%. And finally, for the full year, we expect an immaterial impact from M&A and 1 point of headwind to adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA from assets. Adjusted revenue is expected to be between $2.696 billion to $2.715 billion, up 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.031 billion and $1.047 billion, down 1% to 3%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $2.94 and $3.01, up 5% to 8%. I want to wrap up with some updated thoughts about some of our other annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be about 23%, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate as a result of the timing of the impact of some of our tax planning initiatives. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $365 million. Excluding the step up from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $170 million. Third, net interest expense should be about $120 million, largely as a result of a lower forward LIBOR curve and a reduction in the margins on our term loans as a result of de-leveraging and the late 2019 refinancing we executed. Finally, capital expenditures will be around 7.5% of our revenue in 2020, which will be lower in absolute dollars than we had originally planned before. I will now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Todd. And now to conclude, this morning you have heard how we continue to effectively manage the global stresses created by the COVID pandemic. At the same time, we continue to invest for the long-term strength of our business with meaningful progress in global operations and Project Rise. A very exciting set of strategic partnerships to enhance our data and capabilities around consumers crafted by our global solutions team and the well planned out build of our media vertical. While we maintain a clear plan for long-term growth, in the near-term, we will continue to prioritize the well-being of our associates, customers, consumers and our communities. And I will end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I will turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: That concludes our prepared remarks today. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And now let\u2019s go to those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Revenue guide up or down 1% to up 2% year-over-year, obviously that\u2019s very similar to the plus 1% organic performance that we just had in the third quarter and so my question is, how does that frame with the comments that we are seeing consumer credit recovering. When you look at your October trends, are you extrapolating conservatism from there? What frames that fourth quarter organic revenue guide range?\nChris Cartwright: Hey, Andrew. Well, good morning. This is Chris. And the first part of your question got cut off. So can I ask you to repeat it, and then I think Todd will best answer that one.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay, thanks. No problem. So I am thinking about the fourth quarter organic revenue guide to down 1% to up 2%, and that sounds very similar to me to the third quarter performance that you just guided, plus 1% organic revenue growth. And so my question is what\u2019s being assumed in the fourth quarter guide in terms of the consumer credit activity, of course you highlighted that consumer credit activity on your slide is recovering. So why isn\u2019t organic revenue growth, let\u2019s say, better in the guide than it is in the third quarter performance.\nTodd Cello: Okay. Good morning, Andrew, and thank you for the question. As Chris indicated, I will take that one. So why don\u2019t I walk you through some details as to how we are looking at the anticipated performance of our three segments in the fourth quarter. So first starting with the U.S. markets, we are anticipating that U.S. markets will grow in a mid-single digit range. Mortgage will continue to be strong for us and as you alluded to recovery will continue in our other annual lending markets that we went through detail on of auto and consumer lending and card and banking. However, the one area to call out is within the emerging verticals. We do expect that our Healthcare business will be down as we have signaled throughout our earnings calls in Q2 and Q3, because of the impact of the \u2013 the front-end has on the back-end. And then just to elaborate on that for a minute, the front-end is where we are doing insurance eligibility checks and patient estimation at the onset of the pandemic, we saw significant declines in those volumes as either hospitals cut back and elective procedures or patients just didn\u2019t simply want to be in the facility. So that has had \u2013 that has an impact on the insurance coverage discovery part of our business in the back-end. So everything that we have laid out before about the impacts is playing out pretty much as we have been talking about over the last several \u2013 over the last couple of quarters. If I move over to International, we are expecting International business to be down mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. We are anticipating that the recoveries will continue. But, as Chris said in his remarks, the recovery has been uneven across all of our geographies that we operate in. So that just continues to be an area of focus for us. And then finally our Consumer Interactive business, we are expecting it to grow low-single digits and we \u2013 on the direct channel side of that business, we continue to see strong interest in our credit products, pre-bureau monitoring. However as again we have talked about over the last couple of quarters, we do see on the impact of our indirect channel partners curtailing their marketing programs still having an impact in the fourth quarter. So if you take all that together, Andrew, I mean, that\u2019s how we are getting to the guide that we put out for the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Steinerman: Right. And can I just get a clarification, are you assuming in U.S. markets additional recovery from October or just kind of consistent with October levels?\nTodd Cello: I think you are seeing \u2013 it depends on the market again though, Andrew, right, and that\u2019s the context that we provided on the volume charts in the presentation. So I would say we continue to expect mortgage to be particularly strong into the fourth quarter. We expect to see a continued recovery in consumer lending. The one word of caution that I would give you in consumer lending and when you look at those charts and just those charts in general, you are just looking at our online transactions, you are not looking at the full picture of our revenue. So I think that\u2019s just \u2013 probably looking on the call, context that, so there is a meaningful part of our business with this batch and that\u2019s a good indicator of our consumers, our customers\u2019 willingness to be more aggressive with marketing. So that we are starting to see our customers come back and be more aggressive, but not necessarily at the same level that we are seeing on the online volumes. So, and then kind of round that out, auto, we continue, we expect to kind of continue on the trend that it\u2019s on as well as banking and credit card.\nAndrew Steinerman: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Just to follow-up on your comments on the media additions there. Can you give us like an example, maybe real example of how your datasets combined with these acquisitions and the value there? I guess so I am trying to understand what the niche, is it more about just the ID side to say, business measurement or maybe it\u2019s more, I was just hoping you could have clear data?\nAaron Hoffman: So, hey, Manav. Thanks for the question. You kind of broke up at the beginning, as well. I just want to make certain we got this right, your question about our media vertical and the acquisitions that we made.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, correct. I just wanted to get some kind of a real world example of how your capabilities in these acquisitions actually work. And what\u2019s the real niche that you are going after?\nAaron Hoffman: Yes, Chris will take that one.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, great Manav. And operator, I am not sure if this is a technical issue, but the first two questioners, we missed the beginning of their questions. So we are going to struggle unless we can correct that. Okay. Yes, Manav, so we believe for some time that there is an opportunity for us to expand into data and consumer matching in activation services, and in the digital marketing market and we had obviously some intrinsic capabilities as a sophisticated data management company that also possesses a lot of valuable data for marketing enhancement and segmentation, and we have also got very rigorous matching logic as you would expect as a leading bureau. What we did not have necessarily were some of the complementary capabilities needed to commercialize that. So one of those capabilities came in the form of the acquisition of TruSignal where we gained an online platform and a direct to the end user interface that allows marketers to come in and use a user-friendly UI to explore all of our data and the incremental data that TruSignal possess and slice and dice and create very custom and precise audiences. That is a big part of what marketers do as they pursue ever more specific segmentation and individually pursue this segment of one approach. Then when we next acquired Signal, we got there was begin the beginnings of an identity graph, which is really a vehicle for organizing all of the various data elements including digital identifiers around our traditional consumer records, which are comprehensive and accurate. In addition, we gained connections to a variety of publishers in the digital marketing ecosystem where our clients on the marketing side after they created an audience in the appended digital identifiers to those audience to then connect to publishers in pursuit of targeting those specific consumers. And then the final piece in terms of M&A was with Tru Optik and Tru Optik is one of the early leaders in the over the top streaming media marketing services business. And what they have is relationships with various streaming providers where they can identify the digital identifiers, the URLs etcetera for the households that subscribe to various streaming services. Now what is interesting about this is that Terrestrial TV has obviously been in decline for many years, cable TV is stagnant, and many consumers are cutting the cord. But, as I am sure we all know from our own experience streaming services are growing rapidly. And so, there is an increasing audience there where streaming services are going into individual households. But there is not a lot of visibility as to who are the individuals in that household and how and what identifies them and how can they be segmented and then targeted. And so the combination of what Signal brings, which is knowledge of the various streaming services that are connected into a household and then combining it with the data that TransUnion has and our advanced matching capabilities allows us to deliver to marketers, the segmented audiences that they need to determine whether they want to deliver advertising content to particular households on what you think are streaming services. In addition to that, we got very sophisticated identity \u2013 identity graphing capabilities that were also going to be integrated. So at this point, we feel that the combination of these various acquisitions, plus the unique capabilities we had as a bureau in marketing data company traditionally plus some organic investment and ongoing integration efforts, gives us a very nice complement of services to grow our revenues in this audience creation and segmentation and targeting portion of the very large overall digital advertising ecosystem. I hope that helps.\nManav Patnaik: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you and good morning. Want to ask about the new sales metric that you gave us both given that it\u2019s a new external metric and that 43% growth is a lot higher than I would have ever expected in this environment. So I guess two questions, first, can you just be more specific of what the metric is especially given that many of your revenue streams are transactional, so are they just an estimate or is this based on minimums? And then second, is there any rule of thumb or way that you can help us translate that into revenue. So picking something like if you would normally get, I am making up a number about 4 points of growth from new sales. If you have 40% plus growth that\u2019s 5.6 or so points of revenue contribution, just anyway you can help us with what it is and how that translate us through to revenue? Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, so let me handle the first part of the question, but just as to the second part, Jeff, you sound like me as a business review looking for that rule of thumb translation. I think the first thing \u2013\nJeff Meuler: I mean, I mean your company.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, exactly. The first thing I want to emphasize is that these are not GAAP accounting numbers. These are numbers based on our internal sales pipelines, which we manage with some rigor but they obviously don\u2019t meet the standard direct revenue reporting in the financial results. But they are indicative of the success we are having in the marketplace both because we have adapted to what we are selling and the services that we are providing to consumers rather to our customers during the pandemic with improved sales practices that which come from a variety of effectiveness measures. And so as you can see in 2020, the year of the pandemic, our overall sales pipeline, as we measure it is up 8% and then our rate of bookings or sales closes has improved by 5%. However, the dollar value of all those bookings year-to-date has improved 43% and the way you bridge that math is simply our \u2013 the average deal size has increased by about a third, roughly. Right and again, I just think it speaks and the regional shared is it speaks to both the ongoing good health of the financial institutions that we serve and the broader market places that we serve and also that what we are offering is attractive and that we are delivering it successfully to the market. So that is what we will answer the first part of the question. As to the second one, frankly, I just don\u2019t have a good rule of thumb, we are relying on the sales executives estimates of the deal size. Sometimes, that\u2019s right. Sometimes, it\u2019s not. There is also uncertainties around how long it can take to integrate your particular client for a variety of reasons, client motivation, IT backlogs, etcetera, etcetera. So take it as a number, a directional number of kind of the health of the business.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Chris, you mentioned in your initial comments that you are working with regulators to try to help promote greater financial inclusion. And from my reading of guidance proposal to create a new government sponsored bureau, I guess the objective seems to be just that. And so, would you expect that if you and other bureaus are able to show progress on this front that perhaps maybe there wouldn\u2019t be a need for the government to set up a new bureau, maybe you could just address that and any thoughts on the topic in general, just given the election coming up next week. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, absolutely. Happy to discuss, and obviously this is a very important industry or other issue, not only for our industry, but for the American economy and consumers. And look, I think the bureaus collectively do a very good job of providing comprehensive and accurate and objective information to serve as a basis for extending credit. Now we are not the only information that is used and as you guys know, through recent years each of the bureaus has been extending the range of data available to identify consumers and evaluate their eligibility for loans. I think one thing that everybody can agree on is that increasing the visibility of all consumers so that they can participate in the lending market is a good day. That\u2019s financial inclusion and I think both sides of the aisle are aligned around that. Often the debate comes down to a question of how do you achieve that end. Do you achieve it by the government providing the information and likely restricting certain negative aspects, like how long a delinquent credit remains on a credit report or do you provide even more information on the consumer, so that the consumer gets full credit for other financial behaviors that demonstrate the wherewithal to manage credit. We believe in the latter. I mean, we think that, and we know that when we move to trended data we were certainly able to score a tens of millions more consumers when we began adding alternative data like utility payments and negative activity on checking account and a whole variety of things that we have discussed previously. Again we could score millions of more Americans and score them accurately. What we would advocate for is that, the government assist in broadening our access to data types like telecommunications payments, utilities, consistent rent payments, etcetera, etcetera and then we round out individual consumers financial profiles and help lenders evaluate them and extend credit and price credit accurately for a much larger swap of the population. So if the Democratic candidate, Biden does win the presidency and there is I imagine what we find is a period of intensive dialogue where we are really trying to identify, what is the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. What\u2019s the best way to solve it and I think the bureaus have an important role in whatever solutions are proposed.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question, Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Hi guys, good morning. Just one quick follow-up on another one. And then a question on, just on, Manav, can you say who the customers are, who is buying this [indiscernible] marketing agencies \u2013 they are doing the marketing. And then the question I would like to ask is really on the cost front in the margin, wondered if you could just say is it right to think that the majority of the Project Rise and the other investments you are , whether that\u2019s product development and others are falling within U.S. markets because it\u2019s interesting to see costs there in dollar terms reaccelerate the pace of growth, reaccelerate quite a bit this quarter or significantly margin down more than International where you are still seeing cost decline point of it. Just any color on how we should think about levels of investment within this segment? Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. I will handle the first question and I will pass it to Todd for the second question. But in terms of the digital marketing services that we are providing, it could either be a marketing agency or marketing advisor or an intermediary that was assisting a Corporation in client acquisition through advertising efforts or it could be the corporation directly. We have that, right. But what we are able to do now is help marketers broadly understand who they are targeting and ensure that that is indeed the audience they want to target and then we are able to array digital identifiers around those individuals and then help publishers and help activate those marketing campaigns through publishers.\nTodd Cello: Okay. Thanks, Chris, and good morning, Gary. Thanks for the question. So specifically on the margin, just kind of starting high level margin came in at 38.8% as I said the onset of the call, close to 39% what we would consider to be a very strong quarter, especially when we were tromping against what was probably the highest adjusted EBITDA margin, in the company\u2019s \u2013 in the company\u2019s history. When you drill down into the margins that we are seeing at the segment level, in particular in the U.S. markets, we still came in with what we would consider to be a very strong 40.4% adjusted EBITDA margin and to your point, we have continued to invest in particularly in areas such as solutions operations as we, as Chris highlighted earlier in the call, but also in technology with Project Rise. The only caveat with that is with Project Rise do handle that as an add-back for our non-GAAP metrics, so you are really not seeing that impact when we look at the margins this way. The other thing I would highlight, I mean I mentioned this in my remarks. Within the U.S. \u2013 within the U.S. markets, we accrued for some legal and regulatory matters for losses that we considered were probable and our best estimate for obvious reasons I can\u2019t get into much detail \u2013 more detail on that, but consider that to be a kind of a one timer within the U.S. markets number on this [indiscernible] I mean I think what you see, if you kind of look at the other segments, you will see International\u2019s margins coming in at 39.2%, which was down by 80 basis points. I think you are seeing as the business comes back on kind of two things, the resiliency of the business itself and the flow through of the profit. If you are also seeing those investments, I mean solutions and operations in that business as well too.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Good morning, appreciate you taking the question. I guess just a couple of questions around the U.S. business, particularly the FI business. Chris, you called out strength in consumer, which is largely FinTech. I wonder if you could drill down a little bit into your point of sale lending commentary and whether that includes buy now pay later if that\u2019s a driver and just juxtapose that with some of the weakness in the indirect consumer segment, which I assume is in some cases similar customers. So if you could just kind of parse out that relationship a little bit too will be helpful?\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Look, I think you have identified an interesting mix issue that you see in the consumer sub-segment of our financial results. I mean, first thing I would say about the FinTech and in the consumer \u2013 online consumer lenders in general is that stability has returned to that space and we are seeing improved dollar volume as well as \u2013 a strong return in online volume, although the mix is really different. And I know you follow this, Andrew, that there\u2019s consistent funding flowing into the FinTech lenders and they are beginning to deploy it through more aggressive, albeit still depressed levels of direct marketing relative to pre-COVID, right. But we have got a large swath of this market, as you know and we have particularly large chunk of the point of sale lenders, right. And those lenders are doing exceptionally well in this environment because e-commerce purchases have increased a lot. And that\u2019s why you see from the charts that are online transaction volume in the consumer segment has increased pretty much back to pre COVID. Now, as Todd pointed out earlier, online transactions are a good portion of our revenues in this space, but they don\u2019t account for all of them right, there is still a batch analytics, portfolio management, marketing pre-screen etcetera. But the point-of-sale lenders don\u2019t rely on us to pre-screen and acquire customers and they write on the marketing of their channel partners, right. And so while that segment is booming and thus driving the high origination volumes, you see it\u2019s not leading to the batch marketing work that we were enjoying before COVID when the mix was different. In the next year comment a sub-segment within a point of sale lenders, I really I just don\u2019t have visibility at that level. So I will leave it to Aaron and perhaps you guys can follow-up after the call.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question George Mihalos with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Mihalos: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the question Andrew asked and maybe ask it a little bit differently. You\u2019re talking in the U.S. about momentum on the online side with consumer lending and FinTechs and again you particularly called out the point of sale finance guys, I think you also made a point Chris though, when you were talking about the UK, which is a big, a big FinTech market, a big neo bank market, and so that in that area alternative lending is under some pressure. I was hoping maybe you can kind of juxtapose the two kind of why you think you are seeing sort of strength in the U.S. versus UK, is it more nascency of the U.S. more mix of the U.S. Just any sort of color you might be able to provide there?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I think what\u2019s happening in the UK is that their regulators have been examining lending practices across the space and in particular the online lending segment where the players in question, it\u2019s a combination of both online lenders, but also we call alternative lenders that are originating unsecured in very short-term loans and the regulators have concluded that some of these players, their practices, be it interest rates or a variety of practices, they actually don\u2019t like right. And so they put pressure on those lenders. That pressure has led to a flood of complaints and recovery efforts by consumer advocacy firms in the UK that has pressured a variety of these players to lead the market and that\u2019s really because of the cost of managing the complaints that they are receiving or the recovery request. You are not seeing that in the U.S. and I think it\u2019s a function of different lending practices and perhaps just a function of the stages of evolution of the two different marketplaces. But I think that\u2019s why we are seeing a net decrease in the lenders in the UK \u2013 in the UK markets or there is not that dynamic going on in the U.S. markets.\nGeorge Mihalos: Great, thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you. Hey, Chris, just a quick question on the commentary that the deals in the deal pipeline go up a lot, which area is driving them up so much, why are they going up so much, what\u2019s going on? Is there some kind of mixing going on right now or what do you attribute that to?\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Yes, you\u2019re talking about our sales pipeline, right.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Yes.\nChris Cartwright: I talked about earlier in the metrics and why the sales did larger. Well, look, I would like to think it\u2019s because but I can\u2019t exactly speak for what\u2019s happening in the market across our customer base. I do know that clients are upgrading their credit origination and their portfolio management, data models and practices to use the latest and greatest data and attributes that are available from TransUnion and those tend to be fairly chunky sales. So we are seeing CreditVision, CreditVision Link and of course the COVID-19 attributes driving a lot of that sales success. And then as we have spoken in previous quarters, with the surge of activity online, fraud mitigation, leveraging services like iovation in our overall fraud suite, which we call IDVision, that\u2019s been an attractive area for customers as well. So I think those are the two principle components that are driving the surge in sales in bookings revenue, and the increase in average deal size.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Do you think that that\u2019s unique for where we are right now like within the cycle in the downturn, or is that just something that you think is like the trend that you envision going forward?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I don\u2019t by any stretch believe that the demand for the two sets of products, credit and fraud mitigation is played out by any way. I think it\u2019s probably accelerating on the credit side and really just begin to, well, I can\u2019t say beginning but it\u2019s accelerating on the fraud side too. Whenever the bureaus materially innovate on the data analytics side in a way that can really help lenders better understand their risk around origination and portfolio management, it\u2019s going to lead to increased sales and an upgrade cycle, if you will. And I think that material segments of the marketplace, as consumers have lost employment or entering into forbearance relationships are experiencing distress and lenders need to understand that and in order to understand it, they need to subscribe to our more advanced datasets and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening and I think you will see that upgrades continuing in the intermediate term.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you so much.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And that brings us to the end of the call. I know it\u2019s an extremely busy day with a spate of earnings throughout the space. So we want to be respectful of your time and I give you guys the opportunity to deal with all of those. So thank you everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to talking to you down the road, and we hope you are all safe and well. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. As Chris highlighted, we achieved our upside case scenario for the third quarter, as we benefited from gradual improvement across almost all of our markets as well as the strength and diversity of our portfolio. I will start with our consolidated results and for the sake of simplicity all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the third quarter of 2019, unless noted otherwise. Starting with the income statement, third quarter consolidated revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, the Signal acquisition, which we completed during the quarter, had an immaterial impact on the growth rate. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.8%, down about 190 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter. Despite the decline, we still see this as a very good result given the significant challenges in the market. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 7%. We benefited from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancings and lower LIBOR rates as well as a lower adjusted tax rate of 21.3%, which reflects our tax planning initiatives and a reduction in the Indian statutory rate. Now looking at the segment financial performance U.S. Markets revenue was up 4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Signal had an immaterial impact on the results. Our Financial Services vertical revenue grew 11%. As Chris discussed we saw improvement in all our lending end markets with considerable strength in mortgage and solid recovery in auto and consumer lending. Our card business faced challenging comps from our participation and a significant credit card launch in the year ago quarter. And to address the significant impact of mortgage in the quarter, excluding this cyclical growth, the vertical would have declined low-single digits, an acceleration in non-mortgage performance compared to the second quarter. I will reiterate my caution about the comparisons we may face in mortgage next year as they are likely to be a challenge. And it's worth noting that our mortgage business carries a particularly high margin, which will exasperate the impact of the tough comparisons whenever they come. Emerging Verticals combined declined 3% on a reported basis and 4% organically. Growth in public sector, media, tenant and employment screening and insurance help moderate declines in the other verticals. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% on both the reported and organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined about 260 basis points largely as a result of reserves for legal and regulatory matters that we took during the quarter. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue fell 7% as we saw trends improve in all of our regions, and as Chris discussed in detail. As we mentioned on our February call, we divested a small business in the UK with Recipero. Excluding that divestiture International would have been about 1 point better and our UK business would have been 3 points better. Adjusted EBITDA for International declined 8% in constant currency. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA for Consumer Interactive was up 1% as we continue to increase marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and see solid returns on that investment. As I had stressed over the past two quarters, we have a strong balance sheet and the ability to rapidly build cash. As a result of our attractive cash conversion and prudent steps to appropriately retain cash, we finished the quarter with $554 million of cash on the balance sheet and have not drawn down our $300 million revolving credit facility. The net of all of this, with that our leverage actually fell slightly from 3.0x at the end of the second quarter to 2.9x at the end of September. We will continue to take a prudent approach to cash retention but clearly have sufficient comfort that we were able to fund two acquisitions recently, and continue to be proactive in pursuit of additional attractive investment. As Chris previewed, we are reinstating formal guidance, replacing the scenario based outlooks that we provided for the past few quarters during what we hope will be the worst of the pandemic impact. As we have seen markets generally stabilize, we have sufficient visibility to take a more typical approach to guidance. However, recognizing the potential unknowns of the upcoming election and the recent increases in COVID-19 cases, we have provided a wider range between the low and high end of guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS compared to what we have done previously. For the fourth quarter revenue, we expect about 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik. There is also about 1 point of headwind to revenue and adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue should come in between $678 million and $698 million or a 1% decline to a 2% increase. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $255 million and $271 million, a decrease of 2% to 7%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.74 and $0.80, a decrease of 1% to an increase of 7%. And finally, for the full year, we expect an immaterial impact from M&A and 1 point of headwind to adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA from assets. Adjusted revenue is expected to be between $2.696 billion to $2.715 billion, up 1% to 2%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.031 billion and $1.047 billion, down 1% to 3%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $2.94 and $3.01, up 5% to 8%. I want to wrap up with some updated thoughts about some of our other annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be about 23%, which is slightly higher than the third quarter rate as a result of the timing of the impact of some of our tax planning initiatives. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $365 million. Excluding the step up from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $170 million. Third, net interest expense should be about $120 million, largely as a result of a lower forward LIBOR curve and a reduction in the margins on our term loans as a result of de-leveraging and the late 2019 refinancing we executed. Finally, capital expenditures will be around 7.5% of our revenue in 2020, which will be lower in absolute dollars than we had originally planned before. I will now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Okay. Good morning, Andrew, and thank you for the question. As Chris indicated, I will take that one. So why don't I walk you through some details as to how we are looking at the anticipated performance of our three segments in the fourth quarter. So first starting with the U.S. markets, we are anticipating that U.S. markets will grow in a mid-single digit range. Mortgage will continue to be strong for us and as you alluded to recovery will continue in our other annual lending markets that we went through detail on of auto and consumer lending and card and banking. However, the one area to call out is within the emerging verticals. We do expect that our Healthcare business will be down as we have signaled throughout our earnings calls in Q2 and Q3, because of the impact of the \u2013 the front-end has on the back-end. And then just to elaborate on that for a minute, the front-end is where we are doing insurance eligibility checks and patient estimation at the onset of the pandemic, we saw significant declines in those volumes as either hospitals cut back and elective procedures or patients just didn't simply want to be in the facility. So that has had \u2013 that has an impact on the insurance coverage discovery part of our business in the back-end. So everything that we have laid out before about the impacts is playing out pretty much as we have been talking about over the last several \u2013 over the last couple of quarters. If I move over to International, we are expecting International business to be down mid-single digits on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. We are anticipating that the recoveries will continue. But, as Chris said in his remarks, the recovery has been uneven across all of our geographies that we operate in. So that just continues to be an area of focus for us. And then finally our Consumer Interactive business, we are expecting it to grow low-single digits and we \u2013 on the direct channel side of that business, we continue to see strong interest in our credit products, pre-bureau monitoring. However as again we have talked about over the last couple of quarters, we do see on the impact of our indirect channel partners curtailing their marketing programs still having an impact in the fourth quarter. So if you take all that together, Andrew, I mean, that's how we are getting to the guide that we put out for the fourth quarter. I think you are seeing \u2013 it depends on the market again though, Andrew, right, and that's the context that we provided on the volume charts in the presentation. So I would say we continue to expect mortgage to be particularly strong into the fourth quarter. We expect to see a continued recovery in consumer lending. The one word of caution that I would give you in consumer lending and when you look at those charts and just those charts in general, you are just looking at our online transactions, you are not looking at the full picture of our revenue. So I think that's just \u2013 probably looking on the call, context that, so there is a meaningful part of our business with this batch and that's a good indicator of our consumers, our customers' willingness to be more aggressive with marketing. So that we are starting to see our customers come back and be more aggressive, but not necessarily at the same level that we are seeing on the online volumes. So, and then kind of round that out, auto, we continue, we expect to kind of continue on the trend that it's on as well as banking and credit card. Okay. Thanks, Chris, and good morning, Gary. Thanks for the question. So specifically on the margin, just kind of starting high level margin came in at 38.8% as I said the onset of the call, close to 39% what we would consider to be a very strong quarter, especially when we were tromping against what was probably the highest adjusted EBITDA margin, in the company's \u2013 in the company's history. When you drill down into the margins that we are seeing at the segment level, in particular in the U.S. markets, we still came in with what we would consider to be a very strong 40.4% adjusted EBITDA margin and to your point, we have continued to invest in particularly in areas such as solutions operations as we, as Chris highlighted earlier in the call, but also in technology with Project Rise. The only caveat with that is with Project Rise do handle that as an add-back for our non-GAAP metrics, so you are really not seeing that impact when we look at the margins this way. The other thing I would highlight, I mean I mentioned this in my remarks. Within the U.S. \u2013 within the U.S. markets, we accrued for some legal and regulatory matters for losses that we considered were probable and our best estimate for obvious reasons I can't get into much detail \u2013 more detail on that, but consider that to be a kind of a one timer within the U.S. markets number on this [indiscernible] I mean I think what you see, if you kind of look at the other segments, you will see International's margins coming in at 39.2%, which was down by 80 basis points. I think you are seeing as the business comes back on kind of two things, the resiliency of the business itself and the flow through of the profit. If you are also seeing those investments, I mean solutions and operations in that business as well too."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. At TransUnion, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. Globally, almost every one of our 8,000 employees continued to work from home. A select number of associates have continued to work on-site to ensure our technology infrastructure operates uninterrupted. I want to thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. Other than these critical employees, we see no need to rush back into our offices, as our associates have demonstrated the flexibility to work remotely and run our business with virtually no interruption. In fact, during the third quarter, we conducted a companywide survey of our associates and confirmed that they largely prefer to remain remote at this time and can work at very high levels, while doing so. Now on our last call, I talked about my personal commitment to making TransUnion a more diverse and inclusive company. I want to give you an update on our progress. First, we've appointed Teedra Bernard as our first ever Head of Talent and Diversity. In this role, Teedra's responsibilities include talent acquisition, employment branding, on-boarding associate and manager training, leadership development, career development, employee engagement and employee relations. By lining all of these functions under Teedra's leadership will ensure a diversity and inclusion lens is brought to all of our human capital management decisions. Secondly, we launched a taskforce, which we call Total Impact, which combines all our efforts to support racial equity and social justice and to connect these efforts through and for our associates, our culture and our operating model. This task force will amplify our consumer advocacy and outreach by offering tools and support, and at increasing access to economic opportunity. They will examine the role our data and products play in the financial ecosystem in order to promote greater financial inclusion. The task force has already made progress to ensure that customers use our data responsibly and in line with our mission to promote equal access to economic and other opportunities. And related to this work, we continue to engage with US regulators about how we can promote greater financial inclusion and participation. Finally, we remain committed to training our top leaders to increase their understanding and awareness of racial and equity. During the quarter, they participated in a session on getting comfortable talking about race and equity. We then asked all managers across the globe to attend a three-part series to learn more about race, bias and how they build more inclusive team. Nearly 2000 managers have participated in this important session. It's important to note that these actions represent only a starting point and we remain committed to making meaningful long-term changes at TransUnion. And we have also given our associates November 3 off to help them exercise their right to vote. Regardless of party affiliation and political views, we encourage our associates to get out and vote. Now, I would like to layout the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will provide you with the details about our performance in the third quarter and the trends and dynamics that underpinned our ability to achieve our upside case outlook. I'll also discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and how we continue to support our customers and consumers during this crisis. You will hear a consistent story of adapting our go-to-market approach, our product offerings and solutions to address the current market conditions. Then I'll provide an update on the progress we will made with our global solutions, global operations and Project Rise. I will also discuss our recent media acquisitions and how together do they form the foundation of another attractive vertical. Finally, I will turn the time over to Todd to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. We have decided to reinstate formal guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year, albeit with a wider than normal range of expectations. And he will provide those details as well. Despite our restored comfort in providing guidance, I want to stress that we continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and the macro environment across the US and around the world in the markets in which we compete. We recognize that there is ongoing risk to the economic reopening based on the severity of the pandemic, and also the degree of stimulus being provided to consumers in each of those markets. So, shifting to financial services, let's look at the key trends in that market. I want to start by reviewing the online transaction volumes for financial services in the US, which is our largest vertical market. Volumes improved during the quarter with ongoing strength in mortgage and auto, with improvement in consumer lending, but offset by a very challenging comparison in our card business. I'll talk a little bit more about each of these in the next slide. Before I do, I want to emphasize that the impact of our sales effectiveness programs and innovation, using our US financial services vertical as an example, our new sales pipeline has improved this year by 8%, reflecting robust sales activity and an engaged customer base. Our win rate has increased by 5 percentage points, year-over-year and this has led to an impressive 43% gain in win dollars compared to the same period in 2019. Now taken together, this reflects greater sales efficiency, a focused strategy, a larger average win side and of course, strong execution across the board. We transitioned our teams to virtual selling supported by investments in a fellow training program, new collaboration technologies, an increase in improvement in our digital content and the deployment of internal experts to operate more effectively in the current environment. And throughout my remarks, you will hear about products across verticals in geographies that are meeting the needs of our customers in these current market conditions. Now let's spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the verticals. So to continue with FS, I want to start by talking with the health of the US consumer overall. Over the past six months, consumer balance sheets improved and that should support the long-term health of the economy and our business. In fact, since the onset of COVID, bank deposits reached record levels and the personal savings rate doubled. At the same time, delinquencies generally remained flat or even down for some lending products. A number of factors contributed to this. The significant government stimulus provided additional liquidity to consumers. At the same time, lender forbearance programs alleviated the needs for many consumers to pay their mortgages, allowing them to stay current on other debts to pay down existing debts or simply save more money. And finally, the mortgage refinancing boom allows consumers to save hundreds of dollars each month, which again they can save or use to stay current on their obligations. This demonstrates the importance of government support and the potential impact on consumers as of to-date. So with that as a backdrop, let's turn to mortgage. Both refinancing and home purchase activity remain very strong throughout the third quarter on the strength of our historically low interest rates. The cyclical strength in mortgage certainly helped our result. But we remain cognizant that the cycle will run its course in 2021, and create some challenging comparisons. The current MBA outlook calls for mortgage volumes to decline 23% next year, while Fannie Mae's forecast a 38% decline. In either case, we would expect the preponderance of the impact to occur later in the year. Now auto financing held up low in the quarter as low rates and attractive financing offers stimulated shopping activity in both the new and the used car markets. As our customers shifted to more digital acquisition channels, we won new business for our pre-qualification programs. Looking ahead, tight inventory levels of both new and used cars resulted in constrained industry volumes. Additional market growth will likely require increases in production as well as used vehicle supply from trade-in and auctions to meet the current heightened demand. And the credit card market improved slowly from the dramatic declines we saw between late March through July, notably insurance began to test marketing campaigns to determine how best to reach end market to consumers in the current environment. While marketing volumes remain down year-over-year, they have shown positive trends and we believe they will continue to improve. For our business, as noted on this chart, we are comparing against our participation in a highly successful launch of a new credit card in the third quarter of last year. Excluding that impact, our results would better reflect the underlying market. Finally, consumer lending continued to recover during the quarter as larger FinTech lenders slowly returned to customer acquisition fueled by fall-out levels of investor commitment to funding loans. In particular, we continue to see significant growth with point of sale lenders both from their own success as well as share gains. We expect this subset of the FinTech space to benefit from the very strong holiday season with a likely dramatic increase in online shopping. Across our end markets, we see two themes emerge with lenders. The first relates to their ability to adapt their models to understand the impact of the pandemic on consumers, leading to new sales of CreditVision Acute Relief attributes to help them better assess their current portfolios. And we are seeing meaningful traction in acquiring new users of both CreditVision and CreditVision Link as a means to improve their models for future customer acquisition. The second trend builds on the accelerated transition to digital commerce, resulting in a heightened interest in online fraud mitigation solutions like iovation and the spirit of very substantial conversations around digital marketing, the topic I am going to discuss a bit more later. Now on to our emerging verticals, across most of our emerging verticals, we saw trends improve during the third quarter. Beginning with healthcare, our business continues to face headwinds as the pandemic has an idiosyncratic effect on our healthcare system. Performance played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Front-end patient volumes recovered as provider saw increases that continue to improve the trend toward pre-COVID levels. However ongoing declines for inpatient care particularly for elected procedures as patients remain cautious about returning to healthcare facilities partially offset the improvement in outpatient volume. Similarly, emergency department visits remain depressed. The impact of reduced volumes negatively impacts the back end of the business, resulting in a reduced number of potential coverage discovery opportunities. This all factors against the backdrop of increased financial pressure on those healthcare systems as our business helps providers recover cash, we remain somewhat insulated from the full impact of weaker volumes in the healthcare system. And as we look forward, we see no structural change to this market, such that we will return to a more steady growth profile post-pandemic. Now shifting to insurance, this vertical returned to modest growth in the third quarter. As industry volumes stabilized, we continue to realize success with innovative products like our national driving record solution, which combines drivers risk as a pre-screen for the presence of a motor vehicle violation with our ability to resell state-issued motor vehicle reports. This creates efficiencies for auto insurers. We also continue to benefit from diversification into commercial auto, life and other aspects of property and casualty insurance. And our public sector market grew again as most government agencies continue to operate business as usual providing necessary support for their constituents. Additionally, we gained some business related to the COVID pandemic in fraud mitigation and identification for individuals requesting support from government. We also delivered growth in our screening business, which includes both tenant and employment screening. We saw solid performance in tenant screening as leasing companies remained active and our SmartMove screening product made additional inroads to the marketplace. Employment screening remains depressed as it mirrors employment trends. We offset some of the negative impacts with a successful campaign focused on small business acquisitions, which we provided our ShareAble for Hires tool free for an introductory period. We are now seeing payoff as many new users have converted to the paid product and the telco market continues to improve with the reopening of retail stores and its consumers resume more \u2013 a more normal purchasing cadence. Finally, while we believe collections is countercyclical and will be over time, we don't expect to see any significant uptick until at least the beginning of 2021, as forbearance programs and state-imposed moratoriums on collections continue to delay activity. As I mentioned earlier, government subsidies delayed some collections activities as they enable consumers to pay off debts or stay current leading to lower delinquencies and default. Now, turning to Consumer Interactive, we delivered solid revenue growth in this segment, as consumers and customers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring and related financial education tools like those that we offer both directly and indirectly, through our partners. In the quarter, we saw direct channel revenue accelerate behind continued successful marketing to consumers, focused on their credit health. On the other hand some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, resulting in a decline in subscribers. This caused a slightly larger decline in this portion of our business compared to the second quarter and we expect that to persist in future quarters. At the same time, though, we continue to engage with potential indirect partners about new long-term opportunities. Now moving on to our International segment, let's look at revenue trends, which illustrates the ongoing recovery across all reported regions and countries. Generally, successful re-openings have allowed economy to restart leading to increased overall economic activity. I would note that the degree of reopening varies greatly across our markets. For example, Brazil has never shutdown while the Philippines recently started to emerge from the second complete closure. India took a more phased approach \u2013 approach and the entire country only recently fully reopened. And in the UK, we see the potential for isolated closures as COVID cases have spiked in certain areas. And of course, we continue to monitor all these situations closely. Now, let's spend a few minutes on each region where you'll see a common theme of partnering with our customers to help them navigate the pandemic, optimize leveraging our innovation in CreditVision, CreditView, IDVision and other of our solutions. In the UK, thus far, government stimulus helped consumers manage through the crisis. However, the salary protection provided by the government will diminish from 80% coverage to about 57% coverage and only for areas with local lockdown at the end of October, shifting the burden to employers who may reduce their workforces. And during the fourth quarter, the payment holidays for mortgage and other loans will wind down. These actions may impact the already soft lending market. For our business, we continue to see an exaggerated weakness in the alternative lending market where we hold sizable market share. We also divested a small business earlier in the year, which negatively impacted our growth rate. Todd will provide more information about this later. Successful COVID mitigation business helped offset some of the weakness in the market. That included business with the UK government, the rollout of the TrueVision transitional risk index to help lenders identify consumers who pose a risk of default in the future as well as a number of wins for CreditView including with NatWest, one of the largest lenders in the UK. Our fraud mitigation business continues to deliver solid results and we've seen a recovery in our online gaming and gambling vertical as sports resumed around the world. Our Canadian business grew in the third quarter despite generally weak lending markets. At this time, various aspects of government stimulus are expected to continue. Our good performance reflects the meaningful portfolio of diversification that we've intentionally developed. We saw double digit growth in insurance and direct to consumer as well as a strong performance in the nascent FinTech markets. At the same time, we successfully introduced the credit version of CreditVision Acute Relief and a Vulnerability Index both to assist lenders in better understanding the state of their consumers. In India, the country slowly reopened and our volumes have mirrored that. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio, as well as specific programs to address critical pandemic driven issues. For instance, we supported Indian government's efforts to provide stimulus to small businesses by tightening the market and helping them identify who should receive the support. The Indian government also turned to us to help understand how individual lenders handled forbearance arrangements. We successfully launched a simplified version of our scores and algorithms using CreditVision for FinTech lenders, who in India tend to provide small ticket, very short duration loans. And we continued to deliver valuable insights to our customers. We recently began a weekly thought leadership session called TGIF or TransUnion's Great Insights Friday, where we can bring our customers together virtually and help them work through the impacts of the pandemic. Now in Latin America, we served a variety of markets and most improved from the second quarter. Chile performed relatively well on the strength of its modern, highly digitized economy. Colombia also delivered and improved performance as our customers increased their digital products consumption to meet consumer needs during the shutdown. Other markets saw more modest improvement, reflecting the limited level of government stimulus in some markets. And in Hong Kong, the market has stabilized. Recently, we won new business for our fraud mitigation tools related to digital on-boarding. We saw improvement in our relaunch direct to consumer portal as well as some new opportunities for our CreditView platform. Rounding out APAC, the Philippines continue to face significant headwinds as the country just recently began to reopen from a second complete shutdown. We expect a slow recovery there. And the South African economy remains challenged with GDP expected to decline 9% and consumers and small businesses strained despite an influx of nearly $3 billion of government stimulus. We generated momentum in our business behind CreditVision tools for portfolio review as well as IDVision and seamless onboarding to support our customers' transition to more digital consumption. Our business has maintained a sharp focus on serving our customers and delivering good results in the quarter, we also continued to invest for our future with differentiated programs and approaches to sustain our industry leadership. On our last earnings call, I detailed our global operations and global solutions organizations, as well as our investment in Project Rise. I will update each of those areas today and I will also highlight our investments to build out our media vertical. Now moving to global operations, this area allows us to expand our core capabilities through centralization, optimizing processes and automating them, leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that we will reinvest in new growth projects. I wanted to highlight our progress in this area over the past three months. First in global procurements, we have renegotiated a number of our largest supplier agreements to better focus our spend and leverage that to achieve more favorable terms. We have already realized some initial savings and cost avoidance and I expect that to increase over time. Our negotiations also included adding new features or services to facilitate growth across the enterprise. Second, we intend to replicate the success of our global capability center in Chennai, India, which was recently named one of the 50 Best Workplaces for Women in India by The Great Place to Work Institute. While we continue to add seats in Chennai, by the end of this year, we will open the second location in India in Pune. This location will focus primarily on Project Rise and other significant technology initiatives. Finally, we continue to make progress on reengineering the customer experience. We are implementing new tools that allow us to better understand our customers and to make TransUnion easier to do business with. We remain confident that global operations will deliver significant efficiency and cost benefits that we will both reinvest and return to shareholders, while also furthering our market leadership through improved customer engagement. Now, let me update you on the progress in Global Solutions, which allows us to strategically develop and diffuse innovative products across the more than 30 geographies in which we compete. In recent months, we made significant progress on two partnerships to develop a more comprehensive view of consumers that we can leverage to help our customers make smarter decisions about customer acquisition and risk management. First, we partnered with MX, let me say it again, it's M like Mike and like Xerox to afford avoid any confusion with the large card issuer. We partnered with MX to incorporate consumer contributed data into our solutions. MX aggregates financial information through customer permission connectivity with banks and credit unions and FinTech innovators on more than 30 million consumers. Through this partnership in both the US and Canada, TransUnion will be able to, will enable consumers to enrich their credit profile, help lenders make better, more informed decisions. And ultimately, consumers will benefit from access to better products and services. For lenders, the near-term used cases, we will explore include income verification and the creation of new account derived attributes that will offer visibility into a consumer's ability to pay. In the spirit of leveraging our global capabilities, the solutions team already began coordinating with our UK business where we provide the industry leading affordability suite of solutions and a best-in-class open-banking platform. Both of these capabilities lend themselves to the work with MX and our influence into consumer permission data. MX identified similar solutions in other international markets allowing us to coalesce around this opportunity on the global basis. And we have made a minor equity investment and formed a commercial partnership agreement with FinLocker, which allows consumers to collect and permission their financial information needed to secure a mortgage among other loan types. Consumers maintain control of their information throughout the process and can utilize educational resources to help prepare them for the mortgage application process as well as take advantage of personal lines financial health dashboard something that present homebuyers find appealing. Importantly, FinLocker utilizes banking industry multilayer security like data encryption and application protection to safeguard consumer information. FinLocker also helps lenders better service their existing customers by finding the right products to offer based on the individuals' unique needs while supporting their financial journey to help drive a stronger relationship and reduce the lenders costs. Lenders can offer leverage FinLocker for lead nurturing and conversions or getting deeper insights into consumers' actions and behaviors, making smarter risk decisions and then covering new opportunities to drive growth. Through this partnership, we will offer our marketing and portfolio review solutions to mortgage originators and servicers, providing them with an end-to-end offering. We will also have distribution rights with FinLocker and will explore expanding beyond the mortgage vertical. Now both of these partnerships provide valuable new avenues for growth and by far fully putting together these pieces, we positioned ourselves to begin to offer a broader view of consumers, helping our customers make better decisions through superior insights. At the same time, we can help consumers experience more seamless credit journey. We are still in the early stages of this strategy, but you can see a clear and attractive path in front of us as we fully anticipate that in the finding additional opportunities for these technologies and data in the future. Now to the media vertical, as we have explained in the past, our vertical strategy provides us with a valuable source of sustained differentiated growth. In recent years, we have built out our capabilities organically and through acquisitions to fuel public sector, telecommunications and our screening verticals for example. Over a longer term horizon, we did the same thing to build our nearly $200 million healthcare vertical and our similarly sized insurance vertical. Most recently, we have applied to playbook to build a media vertical focused primarily on digital marketing-related solutions. We recognize that we had foundational pieces necessary to compete successfully in audience segmentation and identity resolution, two growing categories within the larger digital marketing ecosystem. Most notably, we possess a larger array of data and world-class data linking and managing logic. As such, we identified the intersection of the media industry and digital marketing as a market for our expansion. We moved purposely to acquire the capabilities needed to offer a robust portfolio of solutions over these past 18 months that can enable people based and identity enabled marketing. The first acquisition, TruSignal brought a modern cloud-based platform that marketers and media companies use to build and distribute precisely defined audience segments. Users can access this platform directly or through an integrated API within other technology platform. The second acquisition Signal, which we completed earlier this summer added two key offerings. First, the broad product that allows to work with our clients to structure and activate their own Audience Intelligence. Second, it provided a platform for real-time data collection and distribution to connected and complementary advertising and marketing technologies. And earlier this month, we acquired Tru Optik to round out our market position. Tru Optik deepens our understanding of connecting consumers via what they call a household identity graph, essentially a virtual map of the streaming video and audio devices within the home. This understanding of the connected home adds yet another dimension to our ability to match an individual to a broad array of data as well as persistent digital identifiers. Tru Optik with our focus on understanding the connected home and providing solutions for Connected TV as well as streaming audio had gotten ahead of the curve, related to the adoption of streaming media services and the future of TV advertising investments. Marketers turn to Tru Optik to select the homes they want to target for either streaming video or streaming audio campaign. The streaming media providers leveraged Tru Optik to enable to precision targeting that marketers expect. Narrowing all of the capabilities from these three acquisitions gives us an industry leading position within the clearly defined part of the media market, and we believe we can now deliver meaningful sustained growth. Additionally, to fully leverage this opportunity, we will report the digitally focused marketing capabilities across the U.S. markets and vertical portfolio. In fact in just a few weeks since we announced the acquisition, we have already engaged with a number of large financial institutions about using Tru Optik and over time we will also identify how best to extend these capabilities outside of the U.S. And finally, I would like to provide an update on Project Rise. I will start with a broad point, namely that effectively all roads in TransUnion lead back to technology as a core enabler. A lot of the work that we are doing in operations relies on technology. In the fourth quarter, we will migrate our consumer call center to the cloud, resulting in a better consumer experience and greater efficiency. The partnership I described in solutions benefit from the modern technology stack in Data Architecture that we have nurtured over the past 5 years and future progress relies on the evolve technology foundation that Project Rise will deliver. In the media vertical and digital solutions build out depends on the cloud capabilities, we're developing. Beyond that, we remain on track with our timeline, our anticipated investment and effectively time. In fact, in the fourth quarter our first proof of concept applications go live using the first set of Rise capabilities we developed as planned. We continue to see clear operational benefits in security, reliability, performance and efficiency as we progress through this transition to the cloud. As I wrap up my review of the business, I will reiterate the solid improvements we have seen in trends across our market aided by outstanding sales and product development efforts. And at the same time, we continue to aggressively invest to maintain our industry leadership and our attractive growth profile. And with that, I will pass it over to our CFO, Todd. Thanks, Todd. And now to conclude, this morning you have heard how we continue to effectively manage the global stresses created by the COVID pandemic. At the same time, we continue to invest for the long-term strength of our business with meaningful progress in global operations and Project Rise. A very exciting set of strategic partnerships to enhance our data and capabilities around consumers crafted by our global solutions team and the well planned out build of our media vertical. While we maintain a clear plan for long-term growth, in the near-term, we will continue to prioritize the well-being of our associates, customers, consumers and our communities. And I will end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I will turn the time back to Aaron. Hey, Andrew. Well, good morning. This is Chris. And the first part of your question got cut off. So can I ask you to repeat it, and then I think Todd will best answer that one. Yes, great Manav. And operator, I am not sure if this is a technical issue, but the first two questioners, we missed the beginning of their questions. So we are going to struggle unless we can correct that. Okay. Yes, Manav, so we believe for some time that there is an opportunity for us to expand into data and consumer matching in activation services, and in the digital marketing market and we had obviously some intrinsic capabilities as a sophisticated data management company that also possesses a lot of valuable data for marketing enhancement and segmentation, and we have also got very rigorous matching logic as you would expect as a leading bureau. What we did not have necessarily were some of the complementary capabilities needed to commercialize that. So one of those capabilities came in the form of the acquisition of TruSignal where we gained an online platform and a direct to the end user interface that allows marketers to come in and use a user-friendly UI to explore all of our data and the incremental data that TruSignal possess and slice and dice and create very custom and precise audiences. That is a big part of what marketers do as they pursue ever more specific segmentation and individually pursue this segment of one approach. Then when we next acquired Signal, we got there was begin the beginnings of an identity graph, which is really a vehicle for organizing all of the various data elements including digital identifiers around our traditional consumer records, which are comprehensive and accurate. In addition, we gained connections to a variety of publishers in the digital marketing ecosystem where our clients on the marketing side after they created an audience in the appended digital identifiers to those audience to then connect to publishers in pursuit of targeting those specific consumers. And then the final piece in terms of M&A was with Tru Optik and Tru Optik is one of the early leaders in the over the top streaming media marketing services business. And what they have is relationships with various streaming providers where they can identify the digital identifiers, the URLs etcetera for the households that subscribe to various streaming services. Now what is interesting about this is that Terrestrial TV has obviously been in decline for many years, cable TV is stagnant, and many consumers are cutting the cord. But, as I am sure we all know from our own experience streaming services are growing rapidly. And so, there is an increasing audience there where streaming services are going into individual households. But there is not a lot of visibility as to who are the individuals in that household and how and what identifies them and how can they be segmented and then targeted. And so the combination of what Signal brings, which is knowledge of the various streaming services that are connected into a household and then combining it with the data that TransUnion has and our advanced matching capabilities allows us to deliver to marketers, the segmented audiences that they need to determine whether they want to deliver advertising content to particular households on what you think are streaming services. In addition to that, we got very sophisticated identity \u2013 identity graphing capabilities that were also going to be integrated. So at this point, we feel that the combination of these various acquisitions, plus the unique capabilities we had as a bureau in marketing data company traditionally plus some organic investment and ongoing integration efforts, gives us a very nice complement of services to grow our revenues in this audience creation and segmentation and targeting portion of the very large overall digital advertising ecosystem. I hope that helps. Yes, so let me handle the first part of the question, but just as to the second part, Jeff, you sound like me as a business review looking for that rule of thumb translation. I think the first thing \u2013 Yes, exactly. The first thing I want to emphasize is that these are not GAAP accounting numbers. These are numbers based on our internal sales pipelines, which we manage with some rigor but they obviously don't meet the standard direct revenue reporting in the financial results. But they are indicative of the success we are having in the marketplace both because we have adapted to what we are selling and the services that we are providing to consumers rather to our customers during the pandemic with improved sales practices that which come from a variety of effectiveness measures. And so as you can see in 2020, the year of the pandemic, our overall sales pipeline, as we measure it is up 8% and then our rate of bookings or sales closes has improved by 5%. However, the dollar value of all those bookings year-to-date has improved 43% and the way you bridge that math is simply our \u2013 the average deal size has increased by about a third, roughly. Right and again, I just think it speaks and the regional shared is it speaks to both the ongoing good health of the financial institutions that we serve and the broader market places that we serve and also that what we are offering is attractive and that we are delivering it successfully to the market. So that is what we will answer the first part of the question. As to the second one, frankly, I just don't have a good rule of thumb, we are relying on the sales executives estimates of the deal size. Sometimes, that's right. Sometimes, it's not. There is also uncertainties around how long it can take to integrate your particular client for a variety of reasons, client motivation, IT backlogs, etcetera, etcetera. So take it as a number, a directional number of kind of the health of the business. Yes, absolutely. Happy to discuss, and obviously this is a very important industry or other issue, not only for our industry, but for the American economy and consumers. And look, I think the bureaus collectively do a very good job of providing comprehensive and accurate and objective information to serve as a basis for extending credit. Now we are not the only information that is used and as you guys know, through recent years each of the bureaus has been extending the range of data available to identify consumers and evaluate their eligibility for loans. I think one thing that everybody can agree on is that increasing the visibility of all consumers so that they can participate in the lending market is a good day. That's financial inclusion and I think both sides of the aisle are aligned around that. Often the debate comes down to a question of how do you achieve that end. Do you achieve it by the government providing the information and likely restricting certain negative aspects, like how long a delinquent credit remains on a credit report or do you provide even more information on the consumer, so that the consumer gets full credit for other financial behaviors that demonstrate the wherewithal to manage credit. We believe in the latter. I mean, we think that, and we know that when we move to trended data we were certainly able to score a tens of millions more consumers when we began adding alternative data like utility payments and negative activity on checking account and a whole variety of things that we have discussed previously. Again we could score millions of more Americans and score them accurately. What we would advocate for is that, the government assist in broadening our access to data types like telecommunications payments, utilities, consistent rent payments, etcetera, etcetera and then we round out individual consumers financial profiles and help lenders evaluate them and extend credit and price credit accurately for a much larger swap of the population. So if the Democratic candidate, Biden does win the presidency and there is I imagine what we find is a period of intensive dialogue where we are really trying to identify, what is the problem we're trying to solve. What's the best way to solve it and I think the bureaus have an important role in whatever solutions are proposed. Okay. I will handle the first question and I will pass it to Todd for the second question. But in terms of the digital marketing services that we are providing, it could either be a marketing agency or marketing advisor or an intermediary that was assisting a Corporation in client acquisition through advertising efforts or it could be the corporation directly. We have that, right. But what we are able to do now is help marketers broadly understand who they are targeting and ensure that that is indeed the audience they want to target and then we are able to array digital identifiers around those individuals and then help publishers and help activate those marketing campaigns through publishers. Okay. Look, I think you have identified an interesting mix issue that you see in the consumer sub-segment of our financial results. I mean, first thing I would say about the FinTech and in the consumer \u2013 online consumer lenders in general is that stability has returned to that space and we are seeing improved dollar volume as well as \u2013 a strong return in online volume, although the mix is really different. And I know you follow this, Andrew, that there's consistent funding flowing into the FinTech lenders and they are beginning to deploy it through more aggressive, albeit still depressed levels of direct marketing relative to pre-COVID, right. But we have got a large swath of this market, as you know and we have particularly large chunk of the point of sale lenders, right. And those lenders are doing exceptionally well in this environment because e-commerce purchases have increased a lot. And that's why you see from the charts that are online transaction volume in the consumer segment has increased pretty much back to pre COVID. Now, as Todd pointed out earlier, online transactions are a good portion of our revenues in this space, but they don't account for all of them right, there is still a batch analytics, portfolio management, marketing pre-screen etcetera. But the point-of-sale lenders don't rely on us to pre-screen and acquire customers and they write on the marketing of their channel partners, right. And so while that segment is booming and thus driving the high origination volumes, you see it's not leading to the batch marketing work that we were enjoying before COVID when the mix was different. In the next year comment a sub-segment within a point of sale lenders, I really I just don't have visibility at that level. So I will leave it to Aaron and perhaps you guys can follow-up after the call. Yes, I think what's happening in the UK is that their regulators have been examining lending practices across the space and in particular the online lending segment where the players in question, it's a combination of both online lenders, but also we call alternative lenders that are originating unsecured in very short-term loans and the regulators have concluded that some of these players, their practices, be it interest rates or a variety of practices, they actually don't like right. And so they put pressure on those lenders. That pressure has led to a flood of complaints and recovery efforts by consumer advocacy firms in the UK that has pressured a variety of these players to lead the market and that's really because of the cost of managing the complaints that they are receiving or the recovery request. You are not seeing that in the U.S. and I think it's a function of different lending practices and perhaps just a function of the stages of evolution of the two different marketplaces. But I think that's why we are seeing a net decrease in the lenders in the UK \u2013 in the UK markets or there is not that dynamic going on in the U.S. markets. Okay. Yes, you're talking about our sales pipeline, right. I talked about earlier in the metrics and why the sales did larger. Well, look, I would like to think it's because but I can't exactly speak for what's happening in the market across our customer base. I do know that clients are upgrading their credit origination and their portfolio management, data models and practices to use the latest and greatest data and attributes that are available from TransUnion and those tend to be fairly chunky sales. So we are seeing CreditVision, CreditVision Link and of course the COVID-19 attributes driving a lot of that sales success. And then as we have spoken in previous quarters, with the surge of activity online, fraud mitigation, leveraging services like iovation in our overall fraud suite, which we call IDVision, that's been an attractive area for customers as well. So I think those are the two principle components that are driving the surge in sales in bookings revenue, and the increase in average deal size. Yes, I don't by any stretch believe that the demand for the two sets of products, credit and fraud mitigation is played out by any way. I think it's probably accelerating on the credit side and really just begin to, well, I can't say beginning but it's accelerating on the fraud side too. Whenever the bureaus materially innovate on the data analytics side in a way that can really help lenders better understand their risk around origination and portfolio management, it's going to lead to increased sales and an upgrade cycle, if you will. And I think that material segments of the marketplace, as consumers have lost employment or entering into forbearance relationships are experiencing distress and lenders need to understand that and in order to understand it, they need to subscribe to our more advanced datasets and I think that's what's happening and I think you will see that upgrades continuing in the intermediate term."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you are safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations Web site. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on the Web site. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With all that out of the way, let me turn it over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. And I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. At TransUnion, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, our customers and the wider communities in which we operate. To that end globally, we continue to have almost every one of our 8,000 employees working from home. There is no need for us to rush back into our offices as our associates have demonstrated the flexibility to work remotely and run our business with virtually no interruption. We remain deeply appreciative of the selfless and tireless work of healthcare professionals, first responders and other essential workers. We recognize them for how much they do to keep so many of us safe. I also want to take a moment to talk about some other heroes. During the quarter, in the wake of the senseless and brutal death of George Floyd, we witnessed a remarkable and swift movement to finally make good on the American promise of equality and justice for all. The millions of Americans who peacefully and thoughtfully took a stand for racial justice, are heroes too. At TransUnion, we have a culture that embraces diversity and fosters inclusion, with more than a dozen affinity groups for employees ranging from African Diaspora for our black associates to a veteran's alliance group to a group for our LGBTQ population and many more. However, we can and we will do more. As a major employer, there are many ways that TransUnion and I connect for change. My first priority will be to ensure our company is a place where all colleagues have equal access to professional growth and career opportunities and can come to work every day as their authentic selves. And listening to many of our colleagues, I know we have more work to do to make that happen. To achieve this goal, we must cement a culture of mutual support and open communication, which we started in earnest with many of our black associates. Our focus on inclusion must exist on an ongoing basis. I believe that the whole is strengthened when we understand and embrace diversity. And I believe we can do more to make this happen. We will not tolerate racism. It has no place at TransUnion. We will have a more diverse company through how we hire, promote and retain our black colleagues and other underrepresented groups. We will improve transparency around promotions and pay. We will increase our training starting with our managers and each of us will undertake unconscious bias training this year. We will listen and learn from each other and survey our associates regularly to measure our progress. I'm grateful to so many of our black associates for having the courage and candor to have this difficult conversation with me and my executive team and help shape the next very important steps with TransUnion. I thank you. There is no easy transition from here. So I'll just move on to the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will give you a short overview of how the second quarter unfolded. Second, I'll discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and how we have supported our customers and consumers during this crisis. You will hear a consistent story of rapidly adapting our go-to-market approach our product offerings and solutions to the current market conditions. Then, I will discuss our ongoing investments to position TransUnion for a continuation of our best-in-class growth. I'll walk you through the early progress we've made with global solutions and global operations. I will also provide you with an update on the status of our accelerated technology initiative, Project Rise. Finally, I'll then turn over the time to Todd to discuss our detailed second quarter results, balance sheet strength and several financial scenarios for the third quarter based on the trends I will describe. Todd will reiterate this, when he talks about the scenarios, but we continue to monitor the socio-economic situation across the U.S. and around the world. We recognize the fragility of the reopenings and the significant risk of returning to more stringent controls that could, again, have a meaningful negative impact on our business. As you seen in our earnings release this morning, TransUnion delivered adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS solidly in our upside case scenario. When we spoke to you in April, we were in the early stages of the pandemic and we're dealing with high levels of uncertainty. It appears that April, May have been the trough and we've seen generally positive trends since then. Over the course of the second quarter, our business benefited as our associates our customers and consumers' transition into a work from home and physically distanced reality. This clearly took some time and created considerable disruption. As we were all settling in government stimulus began to reach consumers who in turn reengaged in the economy, adding momentum to the recovery. And finally, during this time, our customers developed a response stabilized their businesses and mobilized to manage risk. We participated in this range of actions, supporting them with insights and thought leadership, redesigned new products, as well as customized campaigns to strengthen our long-term relationships. We saw similar behavior across the majority of our markets and taken together led to very good results on a relative basis. Let's take a look at the specifics behind the quarter starting with U.S. markets. As we did last quarter, I want to review the overall online transaction volumes year-to-date for U.S. financial services, our largest market vertical. As you can see, performance bottomed out in April and has shown a progressive recovery through May, June and into July. Notably, the combination of our sales effectiveness programs, specific market actions that I'll discuss shortly and the efficiency created by travelling less lead to an increased sales pipeline and improved win rate in financial services as well as in our other verticals. Now I will spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the vertical. Mortgage refinancing activity was very strong throughout the second quarter on the strength of historically low interest rates. At the same time, we saw the home purchase market recover from a sharp decline in the first quarter to modest growth in the second quarter, as pent-up demand from March and April may have flowed into the market. The strength in mortgage certainly helped our clients. But we remain cautious about how long this cycle and it is clearly cyclical growth will persist. The pool of potential refinancing candidates will eventually run its course, though it may be extended as consumers come off forbearance and we maintain a conservative stance about the sustainability of the new home purchase market. Similar to new mortgage activity, auto financing suffered sharp declines in April due to consumers' lockdown and dealer closures. As we moved into May, the market showed great resiliency and we saw the start of a rebound fueled by pent-up demand from April, stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and attractive incentives from auto manufacturers. We also saw an elevated level of used car sales and financings, which tend to entail more credit polls than with a new car purchase. As customers returned to the market, new car inventory had shrunk with factory shutdowns and used car inventory was elevated by off-lease vehicles and the liquidation of rental car fleets. We continue to have success providing relevant solutions including enhanced pre-screen, account management and fraud mitigation solutions, as more transactions have moved online. For watching the market carefully as manufacturers resumed production and government stimulus potentially at bay. Credit Card lending continues to be bifurcated between issuers who are benefiting from the pronounced transition to online commerce offset by those in the travel and terrestrial spaces that have been severely impacted. The latter group will likely experience this sort of pressure until business and leisure travel resume. At the same time, marketing campaigns, particularly using traditional mail have slowed considerably. We've seen some increase in activity around marketing recently, but it remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. Finally, consumer lending has started to rebound during the quarter as some lenders have cautiously shifted to customer acquisition, while others remain on the sidelines working with new models and technology to prepare for a fuller consumer recovery. In the FinTech space, we continue to extend our leadership position in the emerging point-of-sale FinTech market. The POS lenders have seen a boom in activity as online retail patterns continue to shift in their direction. We also began to see additional funding in the FinTech space and believe there's considerable capital on the sidelines that will likely be deployed if the economy and consumer health continue to improve. Across our lending businesses during the quarter, we provided existing thought leadership, dozens of advisory board meetings. We also created a crisis focused solutions bundle for account management and develop relevant data to measure the impact of the crisis on consumers' credit files. As online transactions have risen considerably, so to have incidents of online fraud. To address this, we produced multiple solution bundles to address a range of fraud risk ranging from online transactions to applications, to fraudulent requests for government subsidies. Finally, we developed a suite of COVID specific attributes called CreditVision Acute Relief that includes a non-adverse actionable set of 88 attributes that identify credit relationships for consumers currently in relief status. Attributes allow lenders and insurers to understand how consumers and their accounts have been affected, creating a more complete financial picture. Lenders can utilize this information to better support impacted consumers, ensuring each person is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace, allowing businesses to transact with confidence and help support their customers. Our ability to leverage CreditVision with this expanded set of attributes has helped lenders to better tailor their risk management efforts and improve their direct relationships with struggling consumers. Our number of customers, including some very large lenders, this exposure to CreditVision has led to a significant increase in their interest in using the product more broadly in the future. As I said in my opening comments, while we have seen the early signs of recovery in the lending markets, we remain responsibly cautious about the potential for a regression if reopening stall or reverse themselves, creating the sorts of headwinds we experienced in March and April. However, regardless of the situation, we have positioned ourselves to partner with and support our customers through the crisis. We've taken a similar tact in our healthcare vertical, which helps healthcare providers navigate the revenue cycle and help improve the patient financial experience and maximize reimbursements for uncompensated care. The front-end of the cycle represents about one-third of the revenue of the vertical and includes insurance eligibility checks, identity verification and charity determination and patient payment estimation. As expected the front-end of the business experienced sharp volume declines in the second quarter has patients and providers delayed or canceled elective and preventative care. Over the course of the quarter, we saw volume softness slowly abate as patients gain comfort with returning to medical facilities. Our business also weathered the situation better than the significant volume declines would suggest. As our payment estimation solution is priced on a standard model and we have volume floors and pricing minimums in our other solution lines. The other two thirds of the vertical is the back-end of the revenue cycle, where we help providers identify opportunities to recover lost reimbursement through various revenue recovery products and services. The financial situation for healthcare providers frankly, has been quite dire as highly profitable ER visits and preventative and elective care have diminished significantly. We've seen furloughs, layoffs and even some hospital closures. In fact, the American Hospital Association currently projects $320 billion in losses for hospitals in 2020. As our back-end products health providers increased their revenue, reduce uncompensated care and avoid bad debt write-offs. We provide a critical source of cash flow and in some cases provide essential products and services to assist providers in maintaining financial solvency. As we signal last quarter, we face a potential risk as the reduced front-end volumes may translate to fewer recovery opportunities to work on the back-end. If the current situation holds or worsens, we may see some sort of impact in the back half of the year. In any scenario over the long-term, our solutions continued to represent a valuable and essential part of the revenue cycle, helping providers reduce risk and increase their cash flow. Our insurance vertical serves property and casualty life and commercial insurers with marketing, underwriting solutions and policy management, as well as analytics and investigative tools for claims. As we had expected, insurance has been a less severe impact than many other parts of our business. After an initial slowdown, insurers focused on an improved digital experience for consumers, recognizing an increased need for fraud mitigation tools and began to explore solutions to continue to realize efficiencies in the business. For TransUnion, those three initiatives contribute to our insurance vertical declining only a few percentage points in the quarter. Clearly a better shopping and application experience helps to drive our volumes as insurers pull our data in the underwriting process. At the same time, to combat fraud, we had success selling our risk verification product which helps the insurer confirm important information like garaging address, household drivers and other critical underwriting questions. Customers also recognize the potential cost benefits of implementing our driver risk solution to pre-screen whether the carrier should pull an often expensive motor vehicle report. Only about one-third of applicants have ratable violations on their record, meaning the insurer can significantly improve efficiency through the utilization of our driver risk solution. We stimulated engagement through our advisory boards where we shared valuable insight about the insurance industry while uniquely marrying them with lending trends that provide another window into consumer behavior. Our customers remain engaged on new initiatives and we saw strong contract signings during the quarter across a spectrum of insurers and insured tech players. As we continue to see consumers reengaging and our customers evolving their approach to the market, we expect our insurance vertical to continue to post solid results relative to many other verticals. Now to round out my discussion of the U.S. market segment, I want to touch on a few other verticals starting with public sector, which provides a variety of data driven solutions for federal, state and local governments. At this point, government agencies largely continue to operate unabated in support of their constituents. In the quarter, public sector delivered very strong double-digit growth actually running ahead of our original plan for 2020. Our team has proactively addressed potential opportunities with both federal and state agencies, primarily around fraud mitigation, insider threat monitoring, and contact tracing. While many of our solutions [indiscernible] our customers needs, we have also rapidly innovated to tune our products. For instance, working with our solutions team, we rapidly build a new report within our TLO product to support contact tracing. The report provides and validates contact information. So that call center is charged with reaching at risk individuals can act as efficiently and effectively as possible. We've built a fast growing diversified public sector vertical and expect to continue with strong performance through the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter. While we certainly see collections as counter cyclical overtime, we don't expect to see any significant uptick until early 2021 as forbearance programs and state imposed moratoriums on collections have delayed activity. Government subsidies have helped consumer pay off debts or stay current leading to lower delinquencies and default that we would likely see otherwise. To address the pressure many of our customers face in the near term we went to the market with a campaign that offered short-term relief in exchange for extending our contracts. We also executed a successful campaign for customers to add new products with a free introductory period to help them during this challenging time and to enhance our status as a long-term partner. The campaigns have been well received, resulting in incremental revenue over time. Within our tenant and employment vertical, tenant screening took a sharp hit initially, but has recovered relatively quickly as the rental market has shown some resilience during the crisis. During the quarter, we offered Resident ID, our fraud mitigation tool for free to customers and many have now converted to the paid version. And in May, we launched credit property review, which leverages the COVID acute relief attributes I discussed earlier to provide insights into the credit health of residents and future bad debt risk. We've seen strong initial results from this new offering. Now weak trends in employment screening persisted through the quarter as unemployment skyrocketed and hiring slowed to a near halt. As the economy slowly reopened, we expect some modest recovery in this part of the business. Small businesses and those previously employed by them are among the groups facing the greatest financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. During the quarter, we offered shareable for hires for free to small businesses, so that they can get back up and running quickly and help people get back to work faster. By implementing TransUnion's web based shareable for hires, small businesses can safely and securely conduct background checks on prospective employees within minutes instead of days. As a result of this offer, shareable for hires new account acquisition has nearly tripled since the launch resulting in a 13% increase in our total customer base. And finally, in Telco, we experienced a significant decline early in the quarter that has shifted to a faster than expected recovery due to the pace of reopenings combined with our customers quick transition to digital channels. Turning to consumer interactive, we delivered top and bottom-line growth in this segment as consumers and customers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring and related financial education tools, like those that we offer both directly and indirectly through partners. We clearly benefit from having a diverse range of customers, including individual consumers that subscribe to our direct products, financial institutions and lead aggregators. In the quarter, we saw good performance in our direct channel behind continued successful marketing to consumers focused their credit health. On the other hand, some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, resulting in a decline in subscribers, which is the basis of our revenue model. If these trends persist, we would expect a larger headwind in the back half of this year. At the same time, though, we continue to have meaningful conversations about long-term opportunities with a number of potential indirect partners that have expressed interest in building more robust consumer facing offerings, like financial education and modeling tools for their customers who may be facing difficult personal financial situations. And now wrapping up with our international market, this slide illustrates the sharp decline in revenue that occurred in March and the subsequent recovery we've seen across our regions. The point of this chart is less about the exact numbers and more so about the shape of the curve to help you appreciate the trends that we're seeing at this time. Let's now spend a few minutes on each region, or you will see the impact of our focus on highly relevant solutions to help our customers manage through the current situation. These solutions include CreditVision, CreditView, market leading portfolio management insights and fraud solutions. In the U.K., much like the U.S., the government has provided significant stimulus to help consumers manage through the crisis. For almost one-third of the workforce has been furloughed and is receiving government subsidies. Lending markets were weak particularly as reopenings only recently begun. We've also seen a more significant downturn in subprime and payday lending markets, where we have a particularly strong position. During the quarter, we launched TrueVision Transitional Risk Index to help lenders flag consumers currently receiving government subsidies. So they can proactively address those consumers whenever government relief ends. We've seen strong interest from many of our top 30 customers. The weakness in lending markets was partially offset by continued strength in fraud mitigation solutions, as well as some recently won COVID relief and mitigation business with the U.K. Government. Now, much like the U.K., Canadian lending markets have generally been weak, though significant government stimulus of about 14% of the country's GDP and coordination among the major banks for consumer deferral programs has moderated some of the impacts for the time being. Our business held up well falling less than 2% in the quarter and improving each month throughout the quarter that relatively good performance reflects two of our strengths. First, our team reacted quickly by providing valuable thought leadership, as well as new offerings like risk vulnerability score, COVID benchmarking for competitive analysis, and an acute relief package, which will launch in August. The second is the successful adjacency strategy that we have executed in recent years. Key adjacencies in Canada include insurance, public sector, FinTech, direct-to-consumer, including the CreditView platform and breach mitigation services. During the quarter, these areas outperformed our core financial services business. In India, we experienced dramatically different trends over the course of the quarter. In April, the government implemented an extremely severe lockdown, which depressed volumes considerably. May saw hints of improvement with the reopens in some areas outside of the major financial centers and increased government stimulus. In June, the country largely reopened and consumers began to reengage in the economy. Through the quarter and regardless of the changing circumstances, we remained highly focused on serving our customers engaging with many for as long as two hours each day for a month, helping them understand the evolving situation and how they can best navigate it. At the same time, we tuned some of our solutions to better serve these customers. For instance, we launched an improved small business score and improved our coverage of the space from 60% to 100%. We also supported the Indian government's effort to provide stimulus to small businesses by sizing the market and helping them identify who should be receiving the support. And we successfully launched a simplified version of our scores and algorithms using CreditVision for FinTech lenders, who in India tend to provide small ticket very short duration loans. And like many of our businesses portfolio reviews provided significant value to our customers. In LatAm, we serve a variety of markets and in general has seen very limited recovery as most governments have provided little stimulus and there has been a lack of coordination between lenders and governments. The exception at the moment is in Colombia, where the recovery appears to be accelerating ahead of most other countries fueled by a higher level of stimulus. We also continue to see fits and starts of recovery in South Africa, where we have a diverse portfolio. We have actively worked with our customers to accelerate their transition to more digital channels packaged with valuable fraud mitigation solutions. And in Hong Kong, where we saw the impact of COVID-19, the earliest, the country is largely returned to fairly normal activity, with schools and businesses almost uniformly open. However, the continuing protests against Chinese imposed restrictions on certain civil liberties have disrupted a normal reset of the economy. Of note, during the quarter, we relaunched our direct-to-consumer offering and expect that to contribute to our financial growth going forward, once again. Rounding out APAC, the Philippines continues to face significant headwinds. With an initial very aggressive lockdown that was partially lifted and then restored when COVID-19 cases surged. We continued to expect a very long and slow recovery in the Philippines. Despite some of the idiosyncratic challenges in our various international markets, TransUnion has enviable long-term geographic positions. We remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in all of our markets. I just described how our businesses have adapted to the radical changes our customers and our consumers have faced in the world. I'm pleased with the creativity, urgency and determination that our team has demonstrated to ensure the best possible performance for our business while also strengthening customer relationships. And I'm also pleased that the organization has maintained its commitment to our long-term growth rate at the same time. I want to highlight the direction and early successes of our newly formed solutions and operations organizations as well as Project Rise, our next major technology investment. Let's start with solutions. Our newly formed Global Solutions organization will improve our ability to aggressively and strategically develop and diffuse innovation across the more than 30 geographies in which we compete. We realized consistent success with our vertical and regional strategies with somewhat inconsistent global application of our product suite. CreditVision and CreditView have both been globalized in an efficient and highly successful manner. However, we have an opportunity to expand our approach more fully. Our vertical strategy hinges on a highly focused team of associates with deep experience in a given area like insurance or media or the public sector and our regional strategy benefits from leaders with deep in market knowledge and expertise. We've extrapolated that approach to build a series of solution focused teams populated with talented associates with deep product and market knowledge. In the short time, since we put this organization in place, we've seen a number of successes. In fraud, we had four high quality offerings that overlap in some ways and could complement each other in others. To standardize and globalize our position, we brought in Shai Cohen, a seasoned veteran from the Fraud and Cybersecurity industry, having worked at RSA, EMC, Intel. We've already pulled together three of the solutions and are actively developing our go-forward strategy with a unified global vision and approach. In other cases, this team has accelerated the launch of existing products, including the COVID acute relief attributes that I discussed earlier. I believe that we have just scratched the surface into more fully leveraging our solutions and capabilities on a global scale, which will help sustain our best-in-class top-line growth over the long-term. Another avenue to help ensure our long-term growth trajectory is our investment in global operations which allows us to expand our core capabilities through centralization, process optimization and modernization, leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that can be reinvested to fund growth projects. Our team has identified three focus areas where they can have the greatest impact. The first is global procurement. Historically, most of our centralized procurement has resided within our global technology organization. We intend to leverage and build on that discipline against all spend while creating consistent global standards. We started by renegotiating our 20 largest contracts and are implementing a full lifecycle procure to pay system from [indiscernible] allowing complete spend visibility globally. We will roll this tool out in August in the U.S. and Canada and follow with our remaining regions over time. Second, we also have an opportunity to replicate the success of our Global Capability Center in Chennai, India. We opened it two years ago with about 600 associates focused on global technology and will likely have more than 1000 there in the near future. Establishing this center has helped produce our technology costs and improved our technology capabilities. In fact, the great place to work organization in India recently named the TransUnion Capability Center in Chennai as the number 40 best company to work for out of the field of more than 1000 other companies. We intend to replicate our success in Chennai in other strategic locations around the world to meet the growing needs of our customers, while refining our delivery and support capabilities in eliminating concentration risk. Finally, we have brought our focus to business process optimization, where we have significant opportunities to further enhance the customer experience. Recently, we implemented a contract Lifecycle Management System to convert a very manual process to automate it and vastly improve that critical interaction with customers and suppliers. We've sped up the contract signing time by over 60% with about one-third of all contracts being executed in a single day. We also are actively transitioning to an upgraded CRM to provide more sophisticated and effective workflow management, consistent and transparent customer information and standardized processes. We will utilize an upgraded version of Salesforce that will form the backbone of these efforts. In the future, we will also address other areas, like the time for data loading, smart scoring for batch delivery and dispute acceleration in consumer operations. Over time, we are confident that our focus on operations will yield significant efficiency and cost benefits that can either be reinvested or returned to shareholders, while also furthering our market leadership through improved customer engagement. The final investment focus I want to discuss is Project Rise. Our accelerated technology initiative to ensure that across TransUnion and by design or even more effective, efficient, secure, reliable and performance and we will do this through streamlined processes, automation and more rapid adoption of a hybrid public private cloud architecture globally. We spoke extensively about these plans on our February earnings call and I would refer you back to that commentary for additional details. Project Rise began in earnest early this year, with a clear plan and an experienced leadership team in place. In early March, like so much else in the world, we experienced some delays as we transitioned our organization to a work from home model and face a more challenging environment for hiring, particularly if there were immigration requirements for a candidate, however, just as our business and customers quickly found their footing during the lockdowns, so did the Project Rise team. Already this year, the team has identified a series of critical global applications that will be redeployed in the cloud in early 2021 and others will quickly fall behind them. At the same time, we continue to progress toward our goal of making our entire organization cloud ready, not just our technology team to that end we have embarked on a company-wide education initiative to ensure that we maximize the power of these investments. This also allows us to build our workforce of the future and avoid being reliant on outside firms over the long-term. Just as we did with Project Spark, we will retain a strong internal talent base, which enables consistent and easily managed evolution of our tech stack in the future. At this time, we remain confident in both our timeline and the benefits of these investments. And as I wrap up my review of the business, I want to leave you with a clear message. TransUnion has demonstrated creativity and resilience during the crisis. And we will continue to do so. We also remained deeply committed to delivering outstanding long-term revenue growth and an attractive growing margin. And we have a broad range of opportunities that give us conviction in that outcome. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. As Chris highlighted, we achieved our upside case scenario for the second quarter as we benefited from reopenings in the U.S. and many of our international markets and the efficacy of our proactive response to support customers and consumers. I'll start with our consolidated results and for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the second quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise and all revenue discussions relate to adjusted revenue. Starting with the income statement, second quarter consolidated revenue decreased 4% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency, revenue related to the May 2019 acquisition of TruSignal was immaterial in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.2%, down 150 basis points, compared with the year ago quarter. We realized a much higher margin than anticipated as revenue in margin flow through were relatively good and we maintained a conservative posture on expense management, though we continue to invest as Chris outlined, and we did not reduce headcount. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS fell 4% and our adjusted tax rate was 23.7%. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets revenue was flat compared to the year ago quarter. The TruSignal acquisition had virtually no impact. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 4% on a reported and organic basis. As Chris discussed, we saw improvement in all our lending and markets with considerable strength in mortgage and solid recovery in auto, card and consumer lending. Excluding the cyclical growth in mortgage, the vertical would have declined mid-single digits. Probably not too soon to offer a word of caution about the comparisons we're going to face in mortgage next year is there likely to be a challenge. Emerging verticals declined 5% and 6% on an organic basis. Both in public sector and media helped moderate declines in the other verticals though the two largest insurance and healthcare will hold that relatively well in the face of such a challenging backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% on both the reported and organic basis. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue fell 16%. As we mentioned on our February call, we divested a small business in the U.K. Recipero excluding that divestiture, international revenue would have been about one point better. We saw revenue decline across all of our regions, Canada performed quite well on the strength of their diversified portfolio, while India, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa were severely impacted early in the quarter and generally realized varying levels of recovery. U.K. experienced a sharp impact in financial services partially offset by strengthened fraud in government solutions. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 32%. Consumer interactive revenue increased 4% driven by growth in the direct channels. Adjusted EBITDA for consumer interactive was up 4% even as we increased marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and continue to see good returns on that investment. As I stressed last quarter, we have a strong balance sheet and the ability to rapidly build cash. As a result of our attractive cash conversion and prudent steps to appropriately retain cash, we finished the quarter with $432 million of cash on the balance sheet. This is the highest level of cash on hand since we went public five years ago. In addition, we clearly benefited from outstanding margin flow through even on a slightly depressed revenue base. We also experienced little fall off in our cash collections, which were essentially in line with trends prior to COVID-19. The net of all of this was that our leverage actually fell slightly from 3.1x at the end of the first quarter to 3.0x at the end of June. In addition to the significant cash build and reduced leverage, we continue to have access to $300 million revolver and believe we could enter the debt markets at reasonably attractive rates at this time should the need arise. Notably, our loans have retraced much of their price declines in the leveraged loan market since the start of COVID-19. And currently trade, a little below par and much better than the BB index, indicating continued demand for our paper. A couple of reminders about our portfolio debt; first, we have hedged about 70% of our debt and are benefiting from extremely low LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion, helping to reduce our expectations for net interest expense. Also, we have no debt maturities until the end of 2024. Turning to our priorities for cash, fundamentally, we will continue to take a conservative posture as we face an uncertain back half of the year and want to ensure the health of the company regardless of the macro situation. We continued to prioritize fully funding our business, servicing our debt, paying our dividends and investing in the long-term growth opportunities that Chris described. That said, we are in a position to contemplate additional M&A activity that could be funded from cash, the revolver and/or the debt markets. We will also consider debt pre-payment, if we gain more clarity and confidence about business conditions in the second half of the year. I believe that we have proactively positioned TransUnion to weather these challenging times. And we will continue to demonstrate our commitment to an appropriate and attractive capital structure for our shareholders. Given the ongoing and considerable uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 across all our geographic and vertical markets, we continue to believe that it's prudent to suspend full year 2020 guidance related to adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Over time, we will revisit this decision and at the appropriate time with sufficient visibility reinstate full year guidance. I do want to comment on the three year outlooks that we provided in March of 2019. As I discussed last quarter, given the truly unique circumstances we are facing, the guidance that we provided at that time is 7% per year average revenue growth along with 50 basis points per year on average of margin improvement in double-digit EPS growth no longer makes sense at the current time. However, when we return to a more normal post COVID-19 state, we are confident that our business will deliver against those previous commitments as a result of our persistent strong market positions and the consistent investments we are making even during the pandemic. Of course, we like everyone else, don't know when that return to normalcy will occur. But we do want to be clear with you about our confidence in our long-term growth. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020, we will again provide you with a range of potential outcomes, along with the scenarios around each, which is far more instructive and valuable at this time. And as we said last quarter, scenarios like these are not predictions about what is likely to happen rather they're intended to help you frame possible outcomes. On our call today, we provided additional detailed trend information to illustrate how COVID-19 has impacted TransUnion. We expect to continue to offer these details during the pandemic to help investors. We believe that these scenarios represent our best possible view on the information, trend analysis and marketplace intelligence that we have available right now. The base case is a continuation of the trends Chris previously outlined, which would result in revenue down 5% to flat and that includes about one point of FX headwinds. At the segment level, we would expect U.S. markets to be flat to up low single digits, international to be down low teens and consumer interactive to be down low-single digits. In this scenario, adjusted EBITDA would fall 6% to 12%. And that also includes about one point of negative FX impact. Adjusted diluted EPS would fall less than adjusted EBITDA as a result of lower interest expense and adjusted tax rate. From the framework of this scenario, you can extrapolate that adjusted EBITDA margin would decline slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This would likely be the case as we continue to invest significantly in the initiatives that Chris described, related to solutions, operations and global technology. We would expect cash on hand to build again and that assumes we don't prepay that or make acquisitions. And our net leverage ratio would remain fairly stable. Let me quickly highlight both an upside and downside scenario. In the upside scenario, revenue would grow, adjusted EBITDA would decline less than 6% and could grow and adjusted diluted EPS would be better than adjusted EBITDA. In this case, cash would build fairly significantly and leverage would fall below 3x, again, unless we made an acquisition. In the downside case, revenue would decline more than 5%. Adjusted EBITDA would decline more than 12% and adjusted diluted EPS would decline in line with adjusted EBITDA. In this situation, cash would not build as it does in the other two scenarios and leverage would move up slightly, but should remain below 3.5x. I want to wrap up with some updated thoughts about some of our annual guidance items. First, [Technical Difficulty] to be between 23% and 25%, depending largely on our international earnings. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $360 million excluding the step-up in subsequent M&A portion, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $170 million. Third, net interest expense should be about $125 million as a result of a reduction of the forward LIBOR curve. And finally, capital expenditures will be around 8% of our revenue in 2020, which will be lower in absolute dollars than we had originally planned, of course. To conclude, despite the challenges from COVID-19, we delivered results that reflect the strength of our business model and the diversification of our company. We remain focused on managing through these unprecedented times and believe the strength of our business and our balance sheet will allow us to continue to weather this situation. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Todd. So to conclude this morning, you've heard about how we have weathered the current crisis environment created by COVID-19 as well as our substantial investments in global solutions, global operations and Project Rise. We remain deeply committed to delivering strong above market growth over the long-term and we have a clear plan to do that. In the near term, we will continue to prioritize the well being of our associates, customers and consumers and communities. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And now we'll be glad to take those questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is actually [indiscernible] calling on for Manav. Nice to hear about the improving sales pipeline and win rates. I just was hoping for a little bit of color on, whether you're seeing changes in the type of mix of offerings that are driving that pipeline and also maybe a little bit of color on converting that pipeline into actual new sales if you're seeing any slowing sales cycle. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Yes. Good question and good morning. Yes, in fact, and we spoke about this at the end of our first quarter call, we kind of repositioned our consumer engagement approach, rather our customer engagement approach at the beginning of the pandemic to focus more on risk management and less on acquiring new customers as our customers became concerned about increasing delinquency risk. And so what you saw was a conversion, a diminishment of demand for pre-screens and marketing efforts in general and a pivot toward account management and general risk assessment. And in support of that pivot, we developed through our analytics group, a suite of CreditVision, or printed credit data attributes, we call it our acute release suite. That helps lenders identify those consumers that may be suffering financial distress as a result of the pandemic, who may have entered into forbearance relationships with their lenders and so they can determine the appropriate credit management practices, but also anticipate which lenders or rather consumers are going to need some lending relief after government support sides. That has been very helpful to the marketplace. We've seen strong demand. And what I would emphasize also is that, with a migration to online selling, which has really accelerated during the pandemic, there has been a concurrent increase in fraud activities. And that's driven a lot of demand in new sales for our fraud mitigation solutions, which we've heavily invested in recent years. And I think the combination of that plus and just effective, go-to-market tactics and a lot of thought leadership and client engagement has allowed us to really maintain a very strong pipeline. And I think more importantly, a high win rate in a high absolute level of new sales volume. And that's in comparison to the sales volume that we had achieved and we're trending, in the quarters prior to the pandemic. So I feel really good about the way we adjusted our offerings and our go-to-market in the early phases of the pandemic and we did it on a global basis. And we've had really strong results as a consequence. So, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: I guess just maybe to boil it down a little, the third quarter revenue base case implies a similar trend to Q2 July obviously trending better than April was, I know mortgage comps toughen, and I'll let others ask about kind of the macro and reopening process or restriction factors. I just wanted to make sure I'm picking up on all of the business specific headwinds that you're calling out that we should think to incorporate. So I'm hearing three, but I'd love to know if there's anything else that we should be contemplating or including. So the three I'm hearing the back end healthcare business, from the flow through of the weaker kind of procedures or front-end volumes recently. The second factor would be the indirect consumer solutions on that end market, marketing and end subscriber churn. And then, the third is the collections pricing concessions. Do I have all three of those correct and any others business specific kind of headwinds that you know about that you call out? Thanks.\nTodd Cello: This is Todd. I'll take a stab at that one and let Chris jump in afterwards. So, when we think about the third quarter, I think the first thing that's important to call out is that the third quarter of 2019 was a record quarter for TransUnion. Net revenue and adjusted EBITDA were at all time highs for us. So the fact that we've got a scenario that contemplating, flat to down five, really just speak to the resiliency and the diversification of TransUnion business. As far as the specific drivers, obviously, what we provided and what I just stated just a little while ago, is that, that the base case that we put together is a continuation of the trends that we are seeing right now. So that's obviously contemplating their financial services in particular mortgage as well as auto remains strong. But to your point, you the areas that we want to -- we're keeping our cautious eye on is exactly that on health care in the back end. The impact of health care providers slowing down, or I should take focusing on COVID-19 cases and care and slowing down the other types of preventative and elective churn has an impact on the [indiscernible] because if there's less, care upfront, the tail end of that is there'll be less insurance, to recover later. So that's something we're cautiously watching. And then, consumer interactive, we're keeping an eye in particular on the -- our indirect channel and specifically just the aggregators on what we saw early in the second quarter was a pullback on marketing spend. We've seen some of those aggregators cautiously enter back into the market. And that, collections, I don't think is as much of a driver so I wouldn't particularly focus on that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: I was hoping at this time, it could just give us a little more color on the healthcare revenue declines in the second quarter. Obviously, I listened to carefully as you described Slide 8, are we talking about high single digit declines? How did they do in the second quarter and when you say that back end, could have some drag in to the second half? Could you give us any sense of what your thought on that potential is?\nChris Cartwright: Hey, Todd. Why don't you start with that one? And then I've got some commentary for the end.\nTodd Cello: Yes, sure. And I'll be happy. Hey, good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question on that. So, yes, in the second quarter, as I was just answering Jeff's question, our healthcare business was impacted on the front-end of the revenue cycle management product offerings. So that's where predominantly what we're selling is insurance eligibility type of products, but we also have patient customization services and charity care and other identity products that we sell. The insurance eligibility was lower for the reasons that I just provided to Jeff just simply because the number of cases or patrons to come in, was significantly lower at the beginning of the second quarter. And as I said, it was all -- it was just the focus on COVID-19 for many providers, but we also -- we're dealing with patients kind of going to the hospitals for care, as well as too. As the quarter progressed, we did note that there was somewhat of a recovery on those preventative and elective procedures. And we've actually put out a couple of press releases, to kind of make that point throughout the quarter. So take a look at that, that's some good data that we put out in the market. What we saw on the back end of healthcare in the quarter is that the back end solutions were not down as much simply because of the reasons I just talked about on the front-end, hospital and other care providers, make the majority of the revenues, doing those preventative and elective care. When they shut down those procedures, it had a very significant impact on their operations. So with that, put them in a position unfortunately was to focus on their liquidity, which is where our back end revenue cycle management products came in to help them. And that part of our business, as you know, is focused on what we call insurance, coverage discovery, which is where we are looking for -- care that's been provided, but the provider has not been paid by a commercial insurer, or the government. So those, products service is actually slightly grew for us in the quarter, so that the net of it in Q2, I would -- as I said in my remarks held up relatively well, I'm not going to provide you the exact number but it wasn't a significant decline. I think we were very pleased with the results. As we think about the back half of the year. We are seeing as I said, a little bit of an uptick in the preventative and elective care, which is going to help the front end. But we're a little cautious about the back end right now, just simply because the volumes that weren't there in the April, May timeframe could potentially translate into lower revenues in the second half of the year.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And the one point I would just add to that is regarding the overall health of the healthcare business. We feel pretty good about it. You will remember a couple of years ago, we slipped off of a trend of double-digit organic growth. At that point, we did a major restructuring of our sales force. We restructured we also expanded it and they began selling the entire suite of solutions both what we traditionally provided, but also HPS and Rubixis, two recovery solutions that we added through acquisition. And really, within one quarter of doing that reorganization, we doubled the level of new sales and new implementations. And we have continued on that pace. So, even though, the overall demand for the services has been disrupted because of the unique circumstances around the pandemic, which Todd I think just really nailed in detail. The underlying health of the business is strong and had it not been for COVID-19, I'm very comfortable that we would have returned to the high single-digit organic growth that we'd talked about previously.\nOperator: Our next question is from Gary Bisbee from Bank of America Securities. Go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: I guess a question on the costs. And as we think about all the investments you're making in [indiscernible] and some of the process improvement stuff, but also obviously, focused on cost at this point. Is there any color you can give and how we might think of the cadence of costs? And I guess part of the question is also, the incremental or detrimental margin, whatever you want to call it on the revenue performance this quarter was quite a bit better than I think, how we were thinking about it following your commentary at quarter ago. So just any color to help us think through the moving parts of costs would be great.\nTodd Cello: Hey, Gary, good morning. Its Todd. Let me let me take a stab at that one for you and thanks for asking it, because it's an important one. So as we entered into the second quarter, Chris and I focused quite intensely on managing costs and just overall liquidity of TransUnion just due to the high level of uncertainty that we were operating in -- if you go back to April, which we hope is a trough for us. So, things that we did, during that time, we put a freeze on headcount with the exception of select areas that we felt were important to invest back into particular Project Rise. We also managed our TV expense and other controllable expenses that we have. And I think you can see that when you look at the relative performance of our operating expense in the quarter, I think total operating expenses were only up about $8 million in the quarter and last year we had a very significant benefit on stock-based compensation. So for all intents and purposes, we managed the cost base very strong. And while also making those certain investments. And what we also dealt with in the second quarter was you can see just in the trends that we provided in the presentation materials, you can see the recovery and volumes in particular in the U.S. And then, in our international business might have been a little bit on the lag but start recovery, there was definitely a very high flow through to margin which resulted obviously in a very nice adjusted EBITDA performance for the second quarter. As we go forward, though on costs, we said at the onset of the call, we are not being very deliberate about taking the opportunity to invest back into the business and Chris went into significant detail with all the great programs that we have going on in our operations group as well as in our solutions group, in addition to Project Rise. So we highlighted some of those with procurements and our global capability center, the CRM contract processing and the opposite on the solution side what we're doing with fraud. So we're going to continue to be aggressive investing in those areas, because those are important parts of our organization that we believe are going to drive future growth and when we get out COVID-19 will be a source for the top line from the solutions group, from the ops group, of course efficiency and lower operating expenses.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And just, I think from a philosophical perspective, to answer your question, Gary. I mean, we're still very much focused on strengthening the business during this period. The management team, when I became CEO, obviously we'd had a nice run of results. But we all believed that there was an opportunity to further strengthen the business. And that was in terms of accelerating top line growth. Certainly, ensuring that we could consistently compound at the levels that we had previously and even freeing up cost for further growth investments or for margin improvements. And in the pre-pandemic world, we were confident as a team that we could make the investments in solutions, operations and in Project Rise and still deliver against the margin trends that we'd established in the prior quarters. Obviously, the macro environment has been materially disrupted. I think all things equal, we're weathering the storm pretty well. And I think it's just really important that we not take our eye off the ball, because there's a great opportunity to strengthen the business while still delivering very satisfactory results to the market. And we're going to focus on that because I'm confident we're going to emerge from this. And I'm confident that we're going to be able to resume a solid growth trajectory and it's just going to be better enhanced as a result of the work we're doing in these three areas.\nOperator: Our next question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the consumer interactive segment. It sounds like on the direct side, you're making some investments and just wanted to understand what kind of benefit you're targeting from those. And then, on the indirect side, you talked about some of the headwinds and just wondering if there's any steps that you can take to mitigate some of those. Just trying to understand if there could be upside to your outlook there? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Well, let me talk about the dynamics there and then you can divine, upside against the outlook. But, the two parts of our business again, direct is 40% of our consumer interactive business and the indirect is roughly 60%. The customers that we serve on the indirect side, their business models rely heavily on monetizing leads that they generate by offering our credit report services and other services. And obviously, in an environment where customer acquisition is diminished, their models are going to suffer and their ability to advertise and acquire is going to get restricted. We're working with a variety of the partners that we support to be helpful during this period. We have numerous ideas to continue to innovate and provide them with support and solutions beyond just reselling our credit data and our printed credit data, that's a way for us to get growth in that segment, while the macro landscape is challenged. The benefit and the real balance in our portfolio is, this is a still a very fertile market to establish subscription relationship with consumers directly. And we've taken advantage of that by accelerating our investment. Our yield is really strong our conversion there. And it's pushing very nice organic growth on the direct side, which is helping to balance the headwinds that we've got on the indirect side.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Jeffery from SunTrust. Go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Chris, I'm wondering if you can talk about plans to potentially build out a competitor to Equifax's [fourth] [ph] number database, the EWS business generally, is that initiative that you think is important is that an area were giving TransUnion has the ability to be more competitive and perhaps change some of the growth profile through the cycle for the [UIS] [ph] business.\nChris Cartwright: Well, let me share a few thoughts. I mean, first, obviously, the work number, the [TOCs] [ph] business generally is a tremendous franchise. And with the current very favorable market circumstances, it's performing amazingly well. And as you can see through our efforts, and also experience efforts and others, there is a next generation of income solutions that's coming to market beyond income verification, it's really directly tapping into consumers' checking account, their demand deposit accounts, with consumer permission, of course, through partnerships with financial aggregators. And they're also other vehicles for gathering, both income current account and other alternative data sources that can be predictive of financial management behavior. And I think you'll see all three bureaus developing these solutions, what that landscape ends up looking like is, it's still open for debate. But it is clear that this is a critical new frontier for developing income solutions, rather alternative data solutions everybody's going after.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Go ahead.\nBill Warmington: So you had some cautious comments about the 2021 mortgage comps and I thought it might make sense to ask about how, what mortgages as a percentage of revenue these days? And then also to ask about some of the drivers that you mentioned and how they would play out in terms of the refi backlog, the purchase market and then the impact of forbearance ending, how that all comes into the mix?\nChris Cartwright: Okay, Bill. Yes, let me get started on that. I mean, in more normal circumstances, let's say pre-pandemic, we've told you mortgages between 7% and 8% of our revenues. Right now, because of the surge in volume due to the low interest rate, it's getting closer to 10% of revenues, which is certainly a helpful counter cyclical component at this point in time. When we look at the current mortgage rates and we think about the total universe of mortgages in the U.S. that could be refinanced. Oh, I don't know, maybe 18 million, 20 million, something like that. Some that depends somewhat on the degree to which the bank's lower mortgage pricing to increase the addressable market. And then I think if you just look at the volume of daily refinancings, there's enough backlog where we're comfortable that to the end of '20, we're going to continue to see strong mortgage performance. I think it's hard to see how it really extends beyond the middle of '21. So if I were to take a guess, sometime second quarter of next year, we start to see some material diminishment in the refinancing bubble that we're all enjoying, currently. Todd would you care to add anything to that?\nTodd Cello: No, I think you covered it well, Chris. Good.\nChris Cartwright: Okay.\nOperator: The next question is from Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead.\nSeth Weber: Chris, he mentioned A few times kind of investing in the fraud business. I'm wondering, can you just give us some more details on really what you feel like you still need to do to build out that platform to get to where you want it to be? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure. Well, I would just say, in recent years, we made a couple of material acquisitions that brought great fraud assets into the portfolio. And that complements an already strong business, providing what we call knowledge based authenticators to mitigate online fraud, basically, challenging individuals to demonstrate that they know things that only that individual would know about their credit about information that resides in their public records in order to confirm identity that's effective, but it adds a lot of transactional friction and breakage. And so as a result, we acquired one of the leading providers of device based identification in fraud detection and that is iovation based in Portland. And they complemented another device based acquisition that we had done previously, the solution out of Ireland called Trustev. And then when we acquired the Callcredit business, the Callcredit business, roughly a third of those revenues come from fraud mitigation solutions. The product there is called CallValidate. And it overlaps materially with the product that we have in the U.S. So, what we're currently focused on is, one, understanding from a global perspective, how we need to evolve these capabilities in order to meet both current market demands, but also where we see the market going because that's one thing about fraud, it is challenging and persistent and difficult to mitigate because the fraudsters are super creative. So we're getting a very clear sense on where the market is going. And then, integrating all of these applications on a single next generation platform supported by a global Salesforce and a consistent value proposition that we push out into all of the markets that we serve, and again, we're in 30 regions globally. And they all have varying degrees of ecommerce fraud currently. I mean, if you look at fraud activity, it's highly concentrated in the U.S. markets, Western Europe as well. But as banks and other lenders just raise their barriers of defense in those markets, it will push out into other markets globally. So there's great tailwind in fraud because it's difficult and there's a lot of financial opportunity. And, we want have a best-in-class solution that is, configurable and leverageable into all the different markets that we compete.\nSeth Weber: Do you feel like you have the adequate -- the assets in-house already? And it's just a question of kind of configuring them? Or do you feel like that's an area where you might do more M&A?\nChris Cartwright: Look, I think we've got a great complement of assets currently. And if we integrate them all, we're going to achieve some efficiency that we can apply toward ongoing organic product development internally. That said, there's any number of complimentary fraud mitigation solutions that we could acquire, or continue to invest in. I mean, I think we've got a nice position in one of the leading providers of cellular phone data, which is a great persistent consumer identifier. And it's also a dataset on which our analysts can configure, fraud mitigation algorithms, until we've tended to make those type of early strategic investments in emerging datasets that are helpful to mitigate fraud overall, but also kind of lays a path toward acquisitions.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Mihalos from Cowen. Go ahead.\nGeorge Mihalos: Just had a quick question as it relates to what the emerging markets vertical on page 10, can you sort of rank order for us, what those sub-segments contribute to the emerging verticals sort of after healthcare and insurance? And then, Chris, just the political climate that's out there a lot of rhetoric that's out there. Just curious if you can make any sort of high level comments as to how you think maybe some of these comments, I'm not even trying to call them initiatives sort of play out and any potential impact on the bureaus? Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. So I'm going to ask Todd to handle the first. I'm not sure we give rank ordering, but I'm sure he can provide some color. And then I'll handle the question about the political landscape. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Hey, George, thanks for the question on that. Yes. As far as the emerging verticals are concerned, obviously, we emphasize on insurance and health care. Those are clearly the two biggest in there. If I were to kind of think about it from other significant contributors. I'm in there I'd say, diversified markets which Chris spoke to earlier. You also think of what we do with utilities and telecommunications are just two examples. But it's a broad basket of retailers, ecommerce, businesses like that fall into it. I would then say, tenants and employments and then collections. And then from there think about verticals that we also highlighted in media as well as in the public sector. \nChris Cartwright: Yes. And in terms of the political landscape, if you look at the various proposals that are being discussed by consumer advocates or conservative politicians, like there's really nothing that we haven't seen previously. I'd also point out that often there's a gap between the rhetoric of the campaign versus the reality of legislating post election. From our perspective, the most important thing that we can do is stay engaged in the process. We have a very evolved understanding of the role that the data that we provide plays in fueling the U.S. economy and also economies around the world. We believe that accurate, comprehensive, unbiased and transparent data is critical to enabling maximum consumer lending in fueling economic growth. And we're committed to demonstrating that and explaining that with legislators and regulators alike. And I think overall, we've got a pretty deep and balanced understanding of that perspective. Now, from time-to-time, there are criticisms that the body of information that's used to originate loans has certain biases in it. We really haven't seen it. We have looked hard at this issue over time. We have several smart and aggressive regulators who also look hard at this issue. And, it really hasn't been demonstrated. And I think you just have to get back to the fundamental economic motivations in the situation. It's our desire to provide all the information that we can to promote financial inclusion and really expand the lendable universe. That's good business for TransUnion. It's good for American consumers and it's good for lenders alike. So we want to provide comprehensive and unbiased and accurate information and I feel as a whole that our industry does.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks everybody for joining us on the call. We hit the bottom of the hour here. So we're going to wrap up the call, everybody, I know there's a lot of calls going on today, get onto those. Thanks everybody for your time and we hope you continue to be safe and healthy. All the best.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. As Chris highlighted, we achieved our upside case scenario for the second quarter as we benefited from reopenings in the U.S. and many of our international markets and the efficacy of our proactive response to support customers and consumers. I'll start with our consolidated results and for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the second quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise and all revenue discussions relate to adjusted revenue. Starting with the income statement, second quarter consolidated revenue decreased 4% on a reported basis and 3% in constant currency, revenue related to the May 2019 acquisition of TruSignal was immaterial in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 8% on a reported basis and 7% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.2%, down 150 basis points, compared with the year ago quarter. We realized a much higher margin than anticipated as revenue in margin flow through were relatively good and we maintained a conservative posture on expense management, though we continue to invest as Chris outlined, and we did not reduce headcount. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS fell 4% and our adjusted tax rate was 23.7%. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets revenue was flat compared to the year ago quarter. The TruSignal acquisition had virtually no impact. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 4% on a reported and organic basis. As Chris discussed, we saw improvement in all our lending and markets with considerable strength in mortgage and solid recovery in auto, card and consumer lending. Excluding the cyclical growth in mortgage, the vertical would have declined mid-single digits. Probably not too soon to offer a word of caution about the comparisons we're going to face in mortgage next year is there likely to be a challenge. Emerging verticals declined 5% and 6% on an organic basis. Both in public sector and media helped moderate declines in the other verticals though the two largest insurance and healthcare will hold that relatively well in the face of such a challenging backdrop. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets decreased 2% on both the reported and organic basis. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue fell 16%. As we mentioned on our February call, we divested a small business in the U.K. Recipero excluding that divestiture, international revenue would have been about one point better. We saw revenue decline across all of our regions, Canada performed quite well on the strength of their diversified portfolio, while India, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Africa were severely impacted early in the quarter and generally realized varying levels of recovery. U.K. experienced a sharp impact in financial services partially offset by strengthened fraud in government solutions. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 32%. Consumer interactive revenue increased 4% driven by growth in the direct channels. Adjusted EBITDA for consumer interactive was up 4% even as we increased marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and continue to see good returns on that investment. As I stressed last quarter, we have a strong balance sheet and the ability to rapidly build cash. As a result of our attractive cash conversion and prudent steps to appropriately retain cash, we finished the quarter with $432 million of cash on the balance sheet. This is the highest level of cash on hand since we went public five years ago. In addition, we clearly benefited from outstanding margin flow through even on a slightly depressed revenue base. We also experienced little fall off in our cash collections, which were essentially in line with trends prior to COVID-19. The net of all of this was that our leverage actually fell slightly from 3.1x at the end of the first quarter to 3.0x at the end of June. In addition to the significant cash build and reduced leverage, we continue to have access to $300 million revolver and believe we could enter the debt markets at reasonably attractive rates at this time should the need arise. Notably, our loans have retraced much of their price declines in the leveraged loan market since the start of COVID-19. And currently trade, a little below par and much better than the BB index, indicating continued demand for our paper. A couple of reminders about our portfolio debt; first, we have hedged about 70% of our debt and are benefiting from extremely low LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion, helping to reduce our expectations for net interest expense. Also, we have no debt maturities until the end of 2024. Turning to our priorities for cash, fundamentally, we will continue to take a conservative posture as we face an uncertain back half of the year and want to ensure the health of the company regardless of the macro situation. We continued to prioritize fully funding our business, servicing our debt, paying our dividends and investing in the long-term growth opportunities that Chris described. That said, we are in a position to contemplate additional M&A activity that could be funded from cash, the revolver and/or the debt markets. We will also consider debt pre-payment, if we gain more clarity and confidence about business conditions in the second half of the year. I believe that we have proactively positioned TransUnion to weather these challenging times. And we will continue to demonstrate our commitment to an appropriate and attractive capital structure for our shareholders. Given the ongoing and considerable uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 across all our geographic and vertical markets, we continue to believe that it's prudent to suspend full year 2020 guidance related to adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Over time, we will revisit this decision and at the appropriate time with sufficient visibility reinstate full year guidance. I do want to comment on the three year outlooks that we provided in March of 2019. As I discussed last quarter, given the truly unique circumstances we are facing, the guidance that we provided at that time is 7% per year average revenue growth along with 50 basis points per year on average of margin improvement in double-digit EPS growth no longer makes sense at the current time. However, when we return to a more normal post COVID-19 state, we are confident that our business will deliver against those previous commitments as a result of our persistent strong market positions and the consistent investments we are making even during the pandemic. Of course, we like everyone else, don't know when that return to normalcy will occur. But we do want to be clear with you about our confidence in our long-term growth. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter of 2020, we will again provide you with a range of potential outcomes, along with the scenarios around each, which is far more instructive and valuable at this time. And as we said last quarter, scenarios like these are not predictions about what is likely to happen rather they're intended to help you frame possible outcomes. On our call today, we provided additional detailed trend information to illustrate how COVID-19 has impacted TransUnion. We expect to continue to offer these details during the pandemic to help investors. We believe that these scenarios represent our best possible view on the information, trend analysis and marketplace intelligence that we have available right now. The base case is a continuation of the trends Chris previously outlined, which would result in revenue down 5% to flat and that includes about one point of FX headwinds. At the segment level, we would expect U.S. markets to be flat to up low single digits, international to be down low teens and consumer interactive to be down low-single digits. In this scenario, adjusted EBITDA would fall 6% to 12%. And that also includes about one point of negative FX impact. Adjusted diluted EPS would fall less than adjusted EBITDA as a result of lower interest expense and adjusted tax rate. From the framework of this scenario, you can extrapolate that adjusted EBITDA margin would decline slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. This would likely be the case as we continue to invest significantly in the initiatives that Chris described, related to solutions, operations and global technology. We would expect cash on hand to build again and that assumes we don't prepay that or make acquisitions. And our net leverage ratio would remain fairly stable. Let me quickly highlight both an upside and downside scenario. In the upside scenario, revenue would grow, adjusted EBITDA would decline less than 6% and could grow and adjusted diluted EPS would be better than adjusted EBITDA. In this case, cash would build fairly significantly and leverage would fall below 3x, again, unless we made an acquisition. In the downside case, revenue would decline more than 5%. Adjusted EBITDA would decline more than 12% and adjusted diluted EPS would decline in line with adjusted EBITDA. In this situation, cash would not build as it does in the other two scenarios and leverage would move up slightly, but should remain below 3.5x. I want to wrap up with some updated thoughts about some of our annual guidance items. First, [Technical Difficulty] to be between 23% and 25%, depending largely on our international earnings. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be about $360 million excluding the step-up in subsequent M&A portion, depreciation and amortization should be approximately $170 million. Third, net interest expense should be about $125 million as a result of a reduction of the forward LIBOR curve. And finally, capital expenditures will be around 8% of our revenue in 2020, which will be lower in absolute dollars than we had originally planned, of course. To conclude, despite the challenges from COVID-19, we delivered results that reflect the strength of our business model and the diversification of our company. We remain focused on managing through these unprecedented times and believe the strength of our business and our balance sheet will allow us to continue to weather this situation. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. This is Todd. I'll take a stab at that one and let Chris jump in afterwards. So, when we think about the third quarter, I think the first thing that's important to call out is that the third quarter of 2019 was a record quarter for TransUnion. Net revenue and adjusted EBITDA were at all time highs for us. So the fact that we've got a scenario that contemplating, flat to down five, really just speak to the resiliency and the diversification of TransUnion business. As far as the specific drivers, obviously, what we provided and what I just stated just a little while ago, is that, that the base case that we put together is a continuation of the trends that we are seeing right now. So that's obviously contemplating their financial services in particular mortgage as well as auto remains strong. But to your point, you the areas that we want to -- we're keeping our cautious eye on is exactly that on health care in the back end. The impact of health care providers slowing down, or I should take focusing on COVID-19 cases and care and slowing down the other types of preventative and elective churn has an impact on the [indiscernible] because if there's less, care upfront, the tail end of that is there'll be less insurance, to recover later. So that's something we're cautiously watching. And then, consumer interactive, we're keeping an eye in particular on the -- our indirect channel and specifically just the aggregators on what we saw early in the second quarter was a pullback on marketing spend. We've seen some of those aggregators cautiously enter back into the market. And that, collections, I don't think is as much of a driver so I wouldn't particularly focus on that. Yes, sure. And I'll be happy. Hey, good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question on that. So, yes, in the second quarter, as I was just answering Jeff's question, our healthcare business was impacted on the front-end of the revenue cycle management product offerings. So that's where predominantly what we're selling is insurance eligibility type of products, but we also have patient customization services and charity care and other identity products that we sell. The insurance eligibility was lower for the reasons that I just provided to Jeff just simply because the number of cases or patrons to come in, was significantly lower at the beginning of the second quarter. And as I said, it was all -- it was just the focus on COVID-19 for many providers, but we also -- we're dealing with patients kind of going to the hospitals for care, as well as too. As the quarter progressed, we did note that there was somewhat of a recovery on those preventative and elective procedures. And we've actually put out a couple of press releases, to kind of make that point throughout the quarter. So take a look at that, that's some good data that we put out in the market. What we saw on the back end of healthcare in the quarter is that the back end solutions were not down as much simply because of the reasons I just talked about on the front-end, hospital and other care providers, make the majority of the revenues, doing those preventative and elective care. When they shut down those procedures, it had a very significant impact on their operations. So with that, put them in a position unfortunately was to focus on their liquidity, which is where our back end revenue cycle management products came in to help them. And that part of our business, as you know, is focused on what we call insurance, coverage discovery, which is where we are looking for -- care that's been provided, but the provider has not been paid by a commercial insurer, or the government. So those, products service is actually slightly grew for us in the quarter, so that the net of it in Q2, I would -- as I said in my remarks held up relatively well, I'm not going to provide you the exact number but it wasn't a significant decline. I think we were very pleased with the results. As we think about the back half of the year. We are seeing as I said, a little bit of an uptick in the preventative and elective care, which is going to help the front end. But we're a little cautious about the back end right now, just simply because the volumes that weren't there in the April, May timeframe could potentially translate into lower revenues in the second half of the year. Hey, Gary, good morning. Its Todd. Let me let me take a stab at that one for you and thanks for asking it, because it's an important one. So as we entered into the second quarter, Chris and I focused quite intensely on managing costs and just overall liquidity of TransUnion just due to the high level of uncertainty that we were operating in -- if you go back to April, which we hope is a trough for us. So, things that we did, during that time, we put a freeze on headcount with the exception of select areas that we felt were important to invest back into particular Project Rise. We also managed our TV expense and other controllable expenses that we have. And I think you can see that when you look at the relative performance of our operating expense in the quarter, I think total operating expenses were only up about $8 million in the quarter and last year we had a very significant benefit on stock-based compensation. So for all intents and purposes, we managed the cost base very strong. And while also making those certain investments. And what we also dealt with in the second quarter was you can see just in the trends that we provided in the presentation materials, you can see the recovery and volumes in particular in the U.S. And then, in our international business might have been a little bit on the lag but start recovery, there was definitely a very high flow through to margin which resulted obviously in a very nice adjusted EBITDA performance for the second quarter. As we go forward, though on costs, we said at the onset of the call, we are not being very deliberate about taking the opportunity to invest back into the business and Chris went into significant detail with all the great programs that we have going on in our operations group as well as in our solutions group, in addition to Project Rise. So we highlighted some of those with procurements and our global capability center, the CRM contract processing and the opposite on the solution side what we're doing with fraud. So we're going to continue to be aggressive investing in those areas, because those are important parts of our organization that we believe are going to drive future growth and when we get out COVID-19 will be a source for the top line from the solutions group, from the ops group, of course efficiency and lower operating expenses. No, I think you covered it well, Chris. Good. Hey, George, thanks for the question on that. Yes. As far as the emerging verticals are concerned, obviously, we emphasize on insurance and health care. Those are clearly the two biggest in there. If I were to kind of think about it from other significant contributors. I'm in there I'd say, diversified markets which Chris spoke to earlier. You also think of what we do with utilities and telecommunications are just two examples. But it's a broad basket of retailers, ecommerce, businesses like that fall into it. I would then say, tenants and employments and then collections. And then from there think about verticals that we also highlighted in media as well as in the public sector."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. And I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. At TransUnion, we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates, our customers and the wider communities in which we operate. To that end globally, we continue to have almost every one of our 8,000 employees working from home. There is no need for us to rush back into our offices as our associates have demonstrated the flexibility to work remotely and run our business with virtually no interruption. We remain deeply appreciative of the selfless and tireless work of healthcare professionals, first responders and other essential workers. We recognize them for how much they do to keep so many of us safe. I also want to take a moment to talk about some other heroes. During the quarter, in the wake of the senseless and brutal death of George Floyd, we witnessed a remarkable and swift movement to finally make good on the American promise of equality and justice for all. The millions of Americans who peacefully and thoughtfully took a stand for racial justice, are heroes too. At TransUnion, we have a culture that embraces diversity and fosters inclusion, with more than a dozen affinity groups for employees ranging from African Diaspora for our black associates to a veteran's alliance group to a group for our LGBTQ population and many more. However, we can and we will do more. As a major employer, there are many ways that TransUnion and I connect for change. My first priority will be to ensure our company is a place where all colleagues have equal access to professional growth and career opportunities and can come to work every day as their authentic selves. And listening to many of our colleagues, I know we have more work to do to make that happen. To achieve this goal, we must cement a culture of mutual support and open communication, which we started in earnest with many of our black associates. Our focus on inclusion must exist on an ongoing basis. I believe that the whole is strengthened when we understand and embrace diversity. And I believe we can do more to make this happen. We will not tolerate racism. It has no place at TransUnion. We will have a more diverse company through how we hire, promote and retain our black colleagues and other underrepresented groups. We will improve transparency around promotions and pay. We will increase our training starting with our managers and each of us will undertake unconscious bias training this year. We will listen and learn from each other and survey our associates regularly to measure our progress. I'm grateful to so many of our black associates for having the courage and candor to have this difficult conversation with me and my executive team and help shape the next very important steps with TransUnion. I thank you. There is no easy transition from here. So I'll just move on to the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will give you a short overview of how the second quarter unfolded. Second, I'll discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and how we have supported our customers and consumers during this crisis. You will hear a consistent story of rapidly adapting our go-to-market approach our product offerings and solutions to the current market conditions. Then, I will discuss our ongoing investments to position TransUnion for a continuation of our best-in-class growth. I'll walk you through the early progress we've made with global solutions and global operations. I will also provide you with an update on the status of our accelerated technology initiative, Project Rise. Finally, I'll then turn over the time to Todd to discuss our detailed second quarter results, balance sheet strength and several financial scenarios for the third quarter based on the trends I will describe. Todd will reiterate this, when he talks about the scenarios, but we continue to monitor the socio-economic situation across the U.S. and around the world. We recognize the fragility of the reopenings and the significant risk of returning to more stringent controls that could, again, have a meaningful negative impact on our business. As you seen in our earnings release this morning, TransUnion delivered adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS solidly in our upside case scenario. When we spoke to you in April, we were in the early stages of the pandemic and we're dealing with high levels of uncertainty. It appears that April, May have been the trough and we've seen generally positive trends since then. Over the course of the second quarter, our business benefited as our associates our customers and consumers' transition into a work from home and physically distanced reality. This clearly took some time and created considerable disruption. As we were all settling in government stimulus began to reach consumers who in turn reengaged in the economy, adding momentum to the recovery. And finally, during this time, our customers developed a response stabilized their businesses and mobilized to manage risk. We participated in this range of actions, supporting them with insights and thought leadership, redesigned new products, as well as customized campaigns to strengthen our long-term relationships. We saw similar behavior across the majority of our markets and taken together led to very good results on a relative basis. Let's take a look at the specifics behind the quarter starting with U.S. markets. As we did last quarter, I want to review the overall online transaction volumes year-to-date for U.S. financial services, our largest market vertical. As you can see, performance bottomed out in April and has shown a progressive recovery through May, June and into July. Notably, the combination of our sales effectiveness programs, specific market actions that I'll discuss shortly and the efficiency created by travelling less lead to an increased sales pipeline and improved win rate in financial services as well as in our other verticals. Now I will spend some time on the key lending markets that comprise the vertical. Mortgage refinancing activity was very strong throughout the second quarter on the strength of historically low interest rates. At the same time, we saw the home purchase market recover from a sharp decline in the first quarter to modest growth in the second quarter, as pent-up demand from March and April may have flowed into the market. The strength in mortgage certainly helped our clients. But we remain cautious about how long this cycle and it is clearly cyclical growth will persist. The pool of potential refinancing candidates will eventually run its course, though it may be extended as consumers come off forbearance and we maintain a conservative stance about the sustainability of the new home purchase market. Similar to new mortgage activity, auto financing suffered sharp declines in April due to consumers' lockdown and dealer closures. As we moved into May, the market showed great resiliency and we saw the start of a rebound fueled by pent-up demand from April, stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and attractive incentives from auto manufacturers. We also saw an elevated level of used car sales and financings, which tend to entail more credit polls than with a new car purchase. As customers returned to the market, new car inventory had shrunk with factory shutdowns and used car inventory was elevated by off-lease vehicles and the liquidation of rental car fleets. We continue to have success providing relevant solutions including enhanced pre-screen, account management and fraud mitigation solutions, as more transactions have moved online. For watching the market carefully as manufacturers resumed production and government stimulus potentially at bay. Credit Card lending continues to be bifurcated between issuers who are benefiting from the pronounced transition to online commerce offset by those in the travel and terrestrial spaces that have been severely impacted. The latter group will likely experience this sort of pressure until business and leisure travel resume. At the same time, marketing campaigns, particularly using traditional mail have slowed considerably. We've seen some increase in activity around marketing recently, but it remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels. Finally, consumer lending has started to rebound during the quarter as some lenders have cautiously shifted to customer acquisition, while others remain on the sidelines working with new models and technology to prepare for a fuller consumer recovery. In the FinTech space, we continue to extend our leadership position in the emerging point-of-sale FinTech market. The POS lenders have seen a boom in activity as online retail patterns continue to shift in their direction. We also began to see additional funding in the FinTech space and believe there's considerable capital on the sidelines that will likely be deployed if the economy and consumer health continue to improve. Across our lending businesses during the quarter, we provided existing thought leadership, dozens of advisory board meetings. We also created a crisis focused solutions bundle for account management and develop relevant data to measure the impact of the crisis on consumers' credit files. As online transactions have risen considerably, so to have incidents of online fraud. To address this, we produced multiple solution bundles to address a range of fraud risk ranging from online transactions to applications, to fraudulent requests for government subsidies. Finally, we developed a suite of COVID specific attributes called CreditVision Acute Relief that includes a non-adverse actionable set of 88 attributes that identify credit relationships for consumers currently in relief status. Attributes allow lenders and insurers to understand how consumers and their accounts have been affected, creating a more complete financial picture. Lenders can utilize this information to better support impacted consumers, ensuring each person is reliably and safely represented in the marketplace, allowing businesses to transact with confidence and help support their customers. Our ability to leverage CreditVision with this expanded set of attributes has helped lenders to better tailor their risk management efforts and improve their direct relationships with struggling consumers. Our number of customers, including some very large lenders, this exposure to CreditVision has led to a significant increase in their interest in using the product more broadly in the future. As I said in my opening comments, while we have seen the early signs of recovery in the lending markets, we remain responsibly cautious about the potential for a regression if reopening stall or reverse themselves, creating the sorts of headwinds we experienced in March and April. However, regardless of the situation, we have positioned ourselves to partner with and support our customers through the crisis. We've taken a similar tact in our healthcare vertical, which helps healthcare providers navigate the revenue cycle and help improve the patient financial experience and maximize reimbursements for uncompensated care. The front-end of the cycle represents about one-third of the revenue of the vertical and includes insurance eligibility checks, identity verification and charity determination and patient payment estimation. As expected the front-end of the business experienced sharp volume declines in the second quarter has patients and providers delayed or canceled elective and preventative care. Over the course of the quarter, we saw volume softness slowly abate as patients gain comfort with returning to medical facilities. Our business also weathered the situation better than the significant volume declines would suggest. As our payment estimation solution is priced on a standard model and we have volume floors and pricing minimums in our other solution lines. The other two thirds of the vertical is the back-end of the revenue cycle, where we help providers identify opportunities to recover lost reimbursement through various revenue recovery products and services. The financial situation for healthcare providers frankly, has been quite dire as highly profitable ER visits and preventative and elective care have diminished significantly. We've seen furloughs, layoffs and even some hospital closures. In fact, the American Hospital Association currently projects $320 billion in losses for hospitals in 2020. As our back-end products health providers increased their revenue, reduce uncompensated care and avoid bad debt write-offs. We provide a critical source of cash flow and in some cases provide essential products and services to assist providers in maintaining financial solvency. As we signal last quarter, we face a potential risk as the reduced front-end volumes may translate to fewer recovery opportunities to work on the back-end. If the current situation holds or worsens, we may see some sort of impact in the back half of the year. In any scenario over the long-term, our solutions continued to represent a valuable and essential part of the revenue cycle, helping providers reduce risk and increase their cash flow. Our insurance vertical serves property and casualty life and commercial insurers with marketing, underwriting solutions and policy management, as well as analytics and investigative tools for claims. As we had expected, insurance has been a less severe impact than many other parts of our business. After an initial slowdown, insurers focused on an improved digital experience for consumers, recognizing an increased need for fraud mitigation tools and began to explore solutions to continue to realize efficiencies in the business. For TransUnion, those three initiatives contribute to our insurance vertical declining only a few percentage points in the quarter. Clearly a better shopping and application experience helps to drive our volumes as insurers pull our data in the underwriting process. At the same time, to combat fraud, we had success selling our risk verification product which helps the insurer confirm important information like garaging address, household drivers and other critical underwriting questions. Customers also recognize the potential cost benefits of implementing our driver risk solution to pre-screen whether the carrier should pull an often expensive motor vehicle report. Only about one-third of applicants have ratable violations on their record, meaning the insurer can significantly improve efficiency through the utilization of our driver risk solution. We stimulated engagement through our advisory boards where we shared valuable insight about the insurance industry while uniquely marrying them with lending trends that provide another window into consumer behavior. Our customers remain engaged on new initiatives and we saw strong contract signings during the quarter across a spectrum of insurers and insured tech players. As we continue to see consumers reengaging and our customers evolving their approach to the market, we expect our insurance vertical to continue to post solid results relative to many other verticals. Now to round out my discussion of the U.S. market segment, I want to touch on a few other verticals starting with public sector, which provides a variety of data driven solutions for federal, state and local governments. At this point, government agencies largely continue to operate unabated in support of their constituents. In the quarter, public sector delivered very strong double-digit growth actually running ahead of our original plan for 2020. Our team has proactively addressed potential opportunities with both federal and state agencies, primarily around fraud mitigation, insider threat monitoring, and contact tracing. While many of our solutions [indiscernible] our customers needs, we have also rapidly innovated to tune our products. For instance, working with our solutions team, we rapidly build a new report within our TLO product to support contact tracing. The report provides and validates contact information. So that call center is charged with reaching at risk individuals can act as efficiently and effectively as possible. We've built a fast growing diversified public sector vertical and expect to continue with strong performance through the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter. While we certainly see collections as counter cyclical overtime, we don't expect to see any significant uptick until early 2021 as forbearance programs and state imposed moratoriums on collections have delayed activity. Government subsidies have helped consumer pay off debts or stay current leading to lower delinquencies and default that we would likely see otherwise. To address the pressure many of our customers face in the near term we went to the market with a campaign that offered short-term relief in exchange for extending our contracts. We also executed a successful campaign for customers to add new products with a free introductory period to help them during this challenging time and to enhance our status as a long-term partner. The campaigns have been well received, resulting in incremental revenue over time. Within our tenant and employment vertical, tenant screening took a sharp hit initially, but has recovered relatively quickly as the rental market has shown some resilience during the crisis. During the quarter, we offered Resident ID, our fraud mitigation tool for free to customers and many have now converted to the paid version. And in May, we launched credit property review, which leverages the COVID acute relief attributes I discussed earlier to provide insights into the credit health of residents and future bad debt risk. We've seen strong initial results from this new offering. Now weak trends in employment screening persisted through the quarter as unemployment skyrocketed and hiring slowed to a near halt. As the economy slowly reopened, we expect some modest recovery in this part of the business. Small businesses and those previously employed by them are among the groups facing the greatest financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. During the quarter, we offered shareable for hires for free to small businesses, so that they can get back up and running quickly and help people get back to work faster. By implementing TransUnion's web based shareable for hires, small businesses can safely and securely conduct background checks on prospective employees within minutes instead of days. As a result of this offer, shareable for hires new account acquisition has nearly tripled since the launch resulting in a 13% increase in our total customer base. And finally, in Telco, we experienced a significant decline early in the quarter that has shifted to a faster than expected recovery due to the pace of reopenings combined with our customers quick transition to digital channels. Turning to consumer interactive, we delivered top and bottom-line growth in this segment as consumers and customers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring and related financial education tools, like those that we offer both directly and indirectly through partners. We clearly benefit from having a diverse range of customers, including individual consumers that subscribe to our direct products, financial institutions and lead aggregators. In the quarter, we saw good performance in our direct channel behind continued successful marketing to consumers focused their credit health. On the other hand, some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, resulting in a decline in subscribers, which is the basis of our revenue model. If these trends persist, we would expect a larger headwind in the back half of this year. At the same time, though, we continue to have meaningful conversations about long-term opportunities with a number of potential indirect partners that have expressed interest in building more robust consumer facing offerings, like financial education and modeling tools for their customers who may be facing difficult personal financial situations. And now wrapping up with our international market, this slide illustrates the sharp decline in revenue that occurred in March and the subsequent recovery we've seen across our regions. The point of this chart is less about the exact numbers and more so about the shape of the curve to help you appreciate the trends that we're seeing at this time. Let's now spend a few minutes on each region, or you will see the impact of our focus on highly relevant solutions to help our customers manage through the current situation. These solutions include CreditVision, CreditView, market leading portfolio management insights and fraud solutions. In the U.K., much like the U.S., the government has provided significant stimulus to help consumers manage through the crisis. For almost one-third of the workforce has been furloughed and is receiving government subsidies. Lending markets were weak particularly as reopenings only recently begun. We've also seen a more significant downturn in subprime and payday lending markets, where we have a particularly strong position. During the quarter, we launched TrueVision Transitional Risk Index to help lenders flag consumers currently receiving government subsidies. So they can proactively address those consumers whenever government relief ends. We've seen strong interest from many of our top 30 customers. The weakness in lending markets was partially offset by continued strength in fraud mitigation solutions, as well as some recently won COVID relief and mitigation business with the U.K. Government. Now, much like the U.K., Canadian lending markets have generally been weak, though significant government stimulus of about 14% of the country's GDP and coordination among the major banks for consumer deferral programs has moderated some of the impacts for the time being. Our business held up well falling less than 2% in the quarter and improving each month throughout the quarter that relatively good performance reflects two of our strengths. First, our team reacted quickly by providing valuable thought leadership, as well as new offerings like risk vulnerability score, COVID benchmarking for competitive analysis, and an acute relief package, which will launch in August. The second is the successful adjacency strategy that we have executed in recent years. Key adjacencies in Canada include insurance, public sector, FinTech, direct-to-consumer, including the CreditView platform and breach mitigation services. During the quarter, these areas outperformed our core financial services business. In India, we experienced dramatically different trends over the course of the quarter. In April, the government implemented an extremely severe lockdown, which depressed volumes considerably. May saw hints of improvement with the reopens in some areas outside of the major financial centers and increased government stimulus. In June, the country largely reopened and consumers began to reengage in the economy. Through the quarter and regardless of the changing circumstances, we remained highly focused on serving our customers engaging with many for as long as two hours each day for a month, helping them understand the evolving situation and how they can best navigate it. At the same time, we tuned some of our solutions to better serve these customers. For instance, we launched an improved small business score and improved our coverage of the space from 60% to 100%. We also supported the Indian government's effort to provide stimulus to small businesses by sizing the market and helping them identify who should be receiving the support. And we successfully launched a simplified version of our scores and algorithms using CreditVision for FinTech lenders, who in India tend to provide small ticket very short duration loans. And like many of our businesses portfolio reviews provided significant value to our customers. In LatAm, we serve a variety of markets and in general has seen very limited recovery as most governments have provided little stimulus and there has been a lack of coordination between lenders and governments. The exception at the moment is in Colombia, where the recovery appears to be accelerating ahead of most other countries fueled by a higher level of stimulus. We also continue to see fits and starts of recovery in South Africa, where we have a diverse portfolio. We have actively worked with our customers to accelerate their transition to more digital channels packaged with valuable fraud mitigation solutions. And in Hong Kong, where we saw the impact of COVID-19, the earliest, the country is largely returned to fairly normal activity, with schools and businesses almost uniformly open. However, the continuing protests against Chinese imposed restrictions on certain civil liberties have disrupted a normal reset of the economy. Of note, during the quarter, we relaunched our direct-to-consumer offering and expect that to contribute to our financial growth going forward, once again. Rounding out APAC, the Philippines continues to face significant headwinds. With an initial very aggressive lockdown that was partially lifted and then restored when COVID-19 cases surged. We continued to expect a very long and slow recovery in the Philippines. Despite some of the idiosyncratic challenges in our various international markets, TransUnion has enviable long-term geographic positions. We remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in all of our markets. I just described how our businesses have adapted to the radical changes our customers and our consumers have faced in the world. I'm pleased with the creativity, urgency and determination that our team has demonstrated to ensure the best possible performance for our business while also strengthening customer relationships. And I'm also pleased that the organization has maintained its commitment to our long-term growth rate at the same time. I want to highlight the direction and early successes of our newly formed solutions and operations organizations as well as Project Rise, our next major technology investment. Let's start with solutions. Our newly formed Global Solutions organization will improve our ability to aggressively and strategically develop and diffuse innovation across the more than 30 geographies in which we compete. We realized consistent success with our vertical and regional strategies with somewhat inconsistent global application of our product suite. CreditVision and CreditView have both been globalized in an efficient and highly successful manner. However, we have an opportunity to expand our approach more fully. Our vertical strategy hinges on a highly focused team of associates with deep experience in a given area like insurance or media or the public sector and our regional strategy benefits from leaders with deep in market knowledge and expertise. We've extrapolated that approach to build a series of solution focused teams populated with talented associates with deep product and market knowledge. In the short time, since we put this organization in place, we've seen a number of successes. In fraud, we had four high quality offerings that overlap in some ways and could complement each other in others. To standardize and globalize our position, we brought in Shai Cohen, a seasoned veteran from the Fraud and Cybersecurity industry, having worked at RSA, EMC, Intel. We've already pulled together three of the solutions and are actively developing our go-forward strategy with a unified global vision and approach. In other cases, this team has accelerated the launch of existing products, including the COVID acute relief attributes that I discussed earlier. I believe that we have just scratched the surface into more fully leveraging our solutions and capabilities on a global scale, which will help sustain our best-in-class top-line growth over the long-term. Another avenue to help ensure our long-term growth trajectory is our investment in global operations which allows us to expand our core capabilities through centralization, process optimization and modernization, leading to a better customer experience as well as cost savings that can be reinvested to fund growth projects. Our team has identified three focus areas where they can have the greatest impact. The first is global procurement. Historically, most of our centralized procurement has resided within our global technology organization. We intend to leverage and build on that discipline against all spend while creating consistent global standards. We started by renegotiating our 20 largest contracts and are implementing a full lifecycle procure to pay system from [indiscernible] allowing complete spend visibility globally. We will roll this tool out in August in the U.S. and Canada and follow with our remaining regions over time. Second, we also have an opportunity to replicate the success of our Global Capability Center in Chennai, India. We opened it two years ago with about 600 associates focused on global technology and will likely have more than 1000 there in the near future. Establishing this center has helped produce our technology costs and improved our technology capabilities. In fact, the great place to work organization in India recently named the TransUnion Capability Center in Chennai as the number 40 best company to work for out of the field of more than 1000 other companies. We intend to replicate our success in Chennai in other strategic locations around the world to meet the growing needs of our customers, while refining our delivery and support capabilities in eliminating concentration risk. Finally, we have brought our focus to business process optimization, where we have significant opportunities to further enhance the customer experience. Recently, we implemented a contract Lifecycle Management System to convert a very manual process to automate it and vastly improve that critical interaction with customers and suppliers. We've sped up the contract signing time by over 60% with about one-third of all contracts being executed in a single day. We also are actively transitioning to an upgraded CRM to provide more sophisticated and effective workflow management, consistent and transparent customer information and standardized processes. We will utilize an upgraded version of Salesforce that will form the backbone of these efforts. In the future, we will also address other areas, like the time for data loading, smart scoring for batch delivery and dispute acceleration in consumer operations. Over time, we are confident that our focus on operations will yield significant efficiency and cost benefits that can either be reinvested or returned to shareholders, while also furthering our market leadership through improved customer engagement. The final investment focus I want to discuss is Project Rise. Our accelerated technology initiative to ensure that across TransUnion and by design or even more effective, efficient, secure, reliable and performance and we will do this through streamlined processes, automation and more rapid adoption of a hybrid public private cloud architecture globally. We spoke extensively about these plans on our February earnings call and I would refer you back to that commentary for additional details. Project Rise began in earnest early this year, with a clear plan and an experienced leadership team in place. In early March, like so much else in the world, we experienced some delays as we transitioned our organization to a work from home model and face a more challenging environment for hiring, particularly if there were immigration requirements for a candidate, however, just as our business and customers quickly found their footing during the lockdowns, so did the Project Rise team. Already this year, the team has identified a series of critical global applications that will be redeployed in the cloud in early 2021 and others will quickly fall behind them. At the same time, we continue to progress toward our goal of making our entire organization cloud ready, not just our technology team to that end we have embarked on a company-wide education initiative to ensure that we maximize the power of these investments. This also allows us to build our workforce of the future and avoid being reliant on outside firms over the long-term. Just as we did with Project Spark, we will retain a strong internal talent base, which enables consistent and easily managed evolution of our tech stack in the future. At this time, we remain confident in both our timeline and the benefits of these investments. And as I wrap up my review of the business, I want to leave you with a clear message. TransUnion has demonstrated creativity and resilience during the crisis. And we will continue to do so. We also remained deeply committed to delivering outstanding long-term revenue growth and an attractive growing margin. And we have a broad range of opportunities that give us conviction in that outcome. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Todd. Thanks, Todd. So to conclude this morning, you've heard about how we have weathered the current crisis environment created by COVID-19 as well as our substantial investments in global solutions, global operations and Project Rise. We remain deeply committed to delivering strong above market growth over the long-term and we have a clear plan to do that. In the near term, we will continue to prioritize the well being of our associates, customers and consumers and communities. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron. Okay. Yes. Good question and good morning. Yes, in fact, and we spoke about this at the end of our first quarter call, we kind of repositioned our consumer engagement approach, rather our customer engagement approach at the beginning of the pandemic to focus more on risk management and less on acquiring new customers as our customers became concerned about increasing delinquency risk. And so what you saw was a conversion, a diminishment of demand for pre-screens and marketing efforts in general and a pivot toward account management and general risk assessment. And in support of that pivot, we developed through our analytics group, a suite of CreditVision, or printed credit data attributes, we call it our acute release suite. That helps lenders identify those consumers that may be suffering financial distress as a result of the pandemic, who may have entered into forbearance relationships with their lenders and so they can determine the appropriate credit management practices, but also anticipate which lenders or rather consumers are going to need some lending relief after government support sides. That has been very helpful to the marketplace. We've seen strong demand. And what I would emphasize also is that, with a migration to online selling, which has really accelerated during the pandemic, there has been a concurrent increase in fraud activities. And that's driven a lot of demand in new sales for our fraud mitigation solutions, which we've heavily invested in recent years. And I think the combination of that plus and just effective, go-to-market tactics and a lot of thought leadership and client engagement has allowed us to really maintain a very strong pipeline. And I think more importantly, a high win rate in a high absolute level of new sales volume. And that's in comparison to the sales volume that we had achieved and we're trending, in the quarters prior to the pandemic. So I feel really good about the way we adjusted our offerings and our go-to-market in the early phases of the pandemic and we did it on a global basis. And we've had really strong results as a consequence. So, thanks. Hey, Todd. Why don't you start with that one? And then I've got some commentary for the end. Yes. And the one point I would just add to that is regarding the overall health of the healthcare business. We feel pretty good about it. You will remember a couple of years ago, we slipped off of a trend of double-digit organic growth. At that point, we did a major restructuring of our sales force. We restructured we also expanded it and they began selling the entire suite of solutions both what we traditionally provided, but also HPS and Rubixis, two recovery solutions that we added through acquisition. And really, within one quarter of doing that reorganization, we doubled the level of new sales and new implementations. And we have continued on that pace. So, even though, the overall demand for the services has been disrupted because of the unique circumstances around the pandemic, which Todd I think just really nailed in detail. The underlying health of the business is strong and had it not been for COVID-19, I'm very comfortable that we would have returned to the high single-digit organic growth that we'd talked about previously. Yes. And just, I think from a philosophical perspective, to answer your question, Gary. I mean, we're still very much focused on strengthening the business during this period. The management team, when I became CEO, obviously we'd had a nice run of results. But we all believed that there was an opportunity to further strengthen the business. And that was in terms of accelerating top line growth. Certainly, ensuring that we could consistently compound at the levels that we had previously and even freeing up cost for further growth investments or for margin improvements. And in the pre-pandemic world, we were confident as a team that we could make the investments in solutions, operations and in Project Rise and still deliver against the margin trends that we'd established in the prior quarters. Obviously, the macro environment has been materially disrupted. I think all things equal, we're weathering the storm pretty well. And I think it's just really important that we not take our eye off the ball, because there's a great opportunity to strengthen the business while still delivering very satisfactory results to the market. And we're going to focus on that because I'm confident we're going to emerge from this. And I'm confident that we're going to be able to resume a solid growth trajectory and it's just going to be better enhanced as a result of the work we're doing in these three areas. Okay. Well, let me talk about the dynamics there and then you can divine, upside against the outlook. But, the two parts of our business again, direct is 40% of our consumer interactive business and the indirect is roughly 60%. The customers that we serve on the indirect side, their business models rely heavily on monetizing leads that they generate by offering our credit report services and other services. And obviously, in an environment where customer acquisition is diminished, their models are going to suffer and their ability to advertise and acquire is going to get restricted. We're working with a variety of the partners that we support to be helpful during this period. We have numerous ideas to continue to innovate and provide them with support and solutions beyond just reselling our credit data and our printed credit data, that's a way for us to get growth in that segment, while the macro landscape is challenged. The benefit and the real balance in our portfolio is, this is a still a very fertile market to establish subscription relationship with consumers directly. And we've taken advantage of that by accelerating our investment. Our yield is really strong our conversion there. And it's pushing very nice organic growth on the direct side, which is helping to balance the headwinds that we've got on the indirect side. Well, let me share a few thoughts. I mean, first, obviously, the work number, the [TOCs] [ph] business generally is a tremendous franchise. And with the current very favorable market circumstances, it's performing amazingly well. And as you can see through our efforts, and also experience efforts and others, there is a next generation of income solutions that's coming to market beyond income verification, it's really directly tapping into consumers' checking account, their demand deposit accounts, with consumer permission, of course, through partnerships with financial aggregators. And they're also other vehicles for gathering, both income current account and other alternative data sources that can be predictive of financial management behavior. And I think you'll see all three bureaus developing these solutions, what that landscape ends up looking like is, it's still open for debate. But it is clear that this is a critical new frontier for developing income solutions, rather alternative data solutions everybody's going after. Okay, Bill. Yes, let me get started on that. I mean, in more normal circumstances, let's say pre-pandemic, we've told you mortgages between 7% and 8% of our revenues. Right now, because of the surge in volume due to the low interest rate, it's getting closer to 10% of revenues, which is certainly a helpful counter cyclical component at this point in time. When we look at the current mortgage rates and we think about the total universe of mortgages in the U.S. that could be refinanced. Oh, I don't know, maybe 18 million, 20 million, something like that. Some that depends somewhat on the degree to which the bank's lower mortgage pricing to increase the addressable market. And then I think if you just look at the volume of daily refinancings, there's enough backlog where we're comfortable that to the end of '20, we're going to continue to see strong mortgage performance. I think it's hard to see how it really extends beyond the middle of '21. So if I were to take a guess, sometime second quarter of next year, we start to see some material diminishment in the refinancing bubble that we're all enjoying, currently. Todd would you care to add anything to that? Okay. Yes, sure. Well, I would just say, in recent years, we made a couple of material acquisitions that brought great fraud assets into the portfolio. And that complements an already strong business, providing what we call knowledge based authenticators to mitigate online fraud, basically, challenging individuals to demonstrate that they know things that only that individual would know about their credit about information that resides in their public records in order to confirm identity that's effective, but it adds a lot of transactional friction and breakage. And so as a result, we acquired one of the leading providers of device based identification in fraud detection and that is iovation based in Portland. And they complemented another device based acquisition that we had done previously, the solution out of Ireland called Trustev. And then when we acquired the Callcredit business, the Callcredit business, roughly a third of those revenues come from fraud mitigation solutions. The product there is called CallValidate. And it overlaps materially with the product that we have in the U.S. So, what we're currently focused on is, one, understanding from a global perspective, how we need to evolve these capabilities in order to meet both current market demands, but also where we see the market going because that's one thing about fraud, it is challenging and persistent and difficult to mitigate because the fraudsters are super creative. So we're getting a very clear sense on where the market is going. And then, integrating all of these applications on a single next generation platform supported by a global Salesforce and a consistent value proposition that we push out into all of the markets that we serve, and again, we're in 30 regions globally. And they all have varying degrees of ecommerce fraud currently. I mean, if you look at fraud activity, it's highly concentrated in the U.S. markets, Western Europe as well. But as banks and other lenders just raise their barriers of defense in those markets, it will push out into other markets globally. So there's great tailwind in fraud because it's difficult and there's a lot of financial opportunity. And, we want have a best-in-class solution that is, configurable and leverageable into all the different markets that we compete. Look, I think we've got a great complement of assets currently. And if we integrate them all, we're going to achieve some efficiency that we can apply toward ongoing organic product development internally. That said, there's any number of complimentary fraud mitigation solutions that we could acquire, or continue to invest in. I mean, I think we've got a nice position in one of the leading providers of cellular phone data, which is a great persistent consumer identifier. And it's also a dataset on which our analysts can configure, fraud mitigation algorithms, until we've tended to make those type of early strategic investments in emerging datasets that are helpful to mitigate fraud overall, but also kind of lays a path toward acquisitions. Okay. So I'm going to ask Todd to handle the first. I'm not sure we give rank ordering, but I'm sure he can provide some color. And then I'll handle the question about the political landscape. Todd? Yes. And in terms of the political landscape, if you look at the various proposals that are being discussed by consumer advocates or conservative politicians, like there's really nothing that we haven't seen previously. I'd also point out that often there's a gap between the rhetoric of the campaign versus the reality of legislating post election. From our perspective, the most important thing that we can do is stay engaged in the process. We have a very evolved understanding of the role that the data that we provide plays in fueling the U.S. economy and also economies around the world. We believe that accurate, comprehensive, unbiased and transparent data is critical to enabling maximum consumer lending in fueling economic growth. And we're committed to demonstrating that and explaining that with legislators and regulators alike. And I think overall, we've got a pretty deep and balanced understanding of that perspective. Now, from time-to-time, there are criticisms that the body of information that's used to originate loans has certain biases in it. We really haven't seen it. We have looked hard at this issue over time. We have several smart and aggressive regulators who also look hard at this issue. And, it really hasn't been demonstrated. And I think you just have to get back to the fundamental economic motivations in the situation. It's our desire to provide all the information that we can to promote financial inclusion and really expand the lendable universe. That's good business for TransUnion. It's good for American consumers and it's good for lenders alike. So we want to provide comprehensive and unbiased and accurate information and I feel as a whole that our industry does."

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are also included in these schedules. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me now turn it over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Nothing is more important. From the earliest days of the COVID pandemic, our primary focus has been the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. In each of the markets we serve, we seamlessly moved to working from home, allowing us to protect our associates in the broader population while continuing to serve businesses and consumers. We appreciate the work of legislators and regulators around the world for taking decisive, significant actions to support consumers, businesses and the economies in these unprecedented times. We especially appreciate and respect the heroic efforts of healthcare professionals, first responders, and other essential workers on the frontlines combating COVID-19 and supporting their communities around the world. Let's begin this morning with an overview of how our first quarter unfolded. From January through the middle of March, TransUnion track well ahead of its prior volumes and meaningfully ahead of the revenue guidance provided in February. We saw strength in the financial services, insurance and public sector verticals in the U.S. as well as robust results in India, Canada and the UK. In mid-March, most of the countries in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place policies in order to slow the spread of coronavirus while absolutely necessary to protect public health. This approach caused a dramatic reduction in economic activity, curtailed consumer lending, and trigged job losses unprecedented in their speed and scale. The rapid increase in unemployment in the U.S. and many other markets has introduced uncertainty into consumer lending well beyond what was experienced in the great recession of 2008 and 2009. Many lenders have pivoted from client acquisition and overall growth strategies to risk management across their existing portfolios and assisting consumers through temporary forbearance arrangements. Despite the sea change in economic activity that began in the second half March, the strength of the first two and a half months of the first quarter resulted in revenue and adjusted EPS for TransUnion above the high-end of our guidance and adjusted EBITDA in the middle of the range. That said, the sharp downturn in transaction volumes experienced in mid-March has continued through April to-date and presents materially different business conditions across our portfolio than we expected in 2020. Given this, we're not able to maintain our previous financial guidance for 2020 or provide new full year guidance. Instead, we will focus today on the second quarter and the volume trends we are currently experiencing in key verticals and markets around the world as well as our approach for managing TransUnion through what we expect will be a prolonged and significant downturn before resuming TransUnion's previous trends for strong organic revenue growth, EBITDA growth and margin expansion. While the nature of this economic downturn is very different than what we experienced over 10 years ago and TransUnion is a very different company. I believe that, the continuity of our management with demonstrated crisis leadership in this industry will allow us to successfully navigate this challenging time. We intend to balance expense actions as required with ongoing investments in innovation and our technology operations and business portfolio. We are implementing across our markets globally a consistent playbook to help clients manage through this downturn. We also expect to maintain our program to accelerate our technology evolution, albeit at a pace calibrated due to current uncertain environment and our financial forecast. This investment is important to maintain our technological advantage and to support a return to the strong growth and relative outperformance we've enjoyed these last six years. Despite the near-term impacts of this COVID-19 driven economic crisis, TransUnion's business model and product and portfolio strength remain intact. I'll discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and our quick transition to support the changed needs of our clients and consumers in this downturn. Although current market conditions present us from providing our usual financial guidance, the following slides illustrate the magnitude of the impact on our transaction volumes resulting shelter-in-place policies in the global economic reset. My commentary and any forward-looking statements must be cautious, measured and taken as directional, given the recency of the downturn and resulting uncertainty across our markets. Once I covered the current market dynamics, I'll hand over to Todd to discuss our detailed first quarter results, balance sheet strength and several financial scenarios for the second quarter, based on the trends I will describe. Let's first review the overall transaction volumes year-to-date for us financial services, our largest vertical market. As you can see, performance was strong relative to 2019 through the middle of March when shelter-in-place guidelines made their impact. We continue to penetrate the market with our broad and leading data solutions and lending volumes remained healthy. Since then, we suffered a considerable downturn against first quarter trends and prior year results. Over the two weeks prior to this call, volumes have stabilized, perhaps as lenders adjust for working from home and look to support their clients beyond implementing the initial round of forbearance arrangements. Now let's review the components of U.S. Financial Services in detail. Beginning with mortgage, refinancing activity was very strong throughout the first quarter on the strength of the low interest rates and further accelerated as the fed lowered rates in anticipation of a virus-led slowdown. While the surge has abated somewhat, refinancing demand exceeds lender's underwriting capacity, especially in this work-from-home environment and is above the last year as volumes. Strong demand for refinancing has kept mortgage rates slightly higher than they might otherwise be, and we expect these conditions to continue in the coming months. For monitoring the potential negative impact of increasing unemployment and payment deferral programs, which could lead to a smaller pool of consumers eligible for refinancing. And despite the overall growth of mortgage activity, new purchase mortgage activity has nearly halted due to quarantine provisions which prevent consumers from visiting properties for sale. We expect this trend to continue until the lockdowns are lifted and consumers are willing to socially interact. This could create pent up demand for home buying depending on broader economic conditions and create future upside opportunity. Similar to new mortgage activity, auto financing has fallen off as dealerships are closed in about half of the United States or only operating online and consumers postponed vehicle purchases. As this chart shows, in recent weeks, we've seen these trends improve as dealers have rapidly accelerated the move to online selling and lending-based initiatives. Vehicle lease expirations and general vehicle replacement needs also create continued minimum demand levels. Based on our experience in the great recession, we expect a recovering demand once consumers are able to return to dealerships and other normal activity resumed. Credit card lending also slowed considerably in March, but appears to have stabilized in recent weeks. The decline in card volume results from issuers reducing new client acquisition to focus on serving the needs of existing customers. Some clients are reducing originations until they better understand the evolving risk or converting acquisition programs to lower cost channels like digital in order to save money on direct mail costs. I would note that TransUnion supports all card marketing channels and approaches. Clients also are expanding their card portfolio reviews given increasing consumer risk and need. Portfolio reviews and event triggers using trended and alternative data are a critical part of risk and account management efforts, and we are increasing our focus on providing these services. Finally, consumer lending has also experienced a material decline in volume, including within the FinTech space. However, not all of the FinTech segments are reacting in the same manner. Many of the traditional FinTechs are focused on their direct customer acquisition channels while limiting partner channel volume. A few of seats most lending until the crisis improves, the retail point of sale FinTechs are experiencing a significant volume boom from increased online sales. Short-term lending volumes have declined substantially while lenders wait for more clarity regarding the U.S. employment situation. However, as we saw after operation chokepoint ended, they are generally able to quickly ramp up when ramp up volume when markets expand. Overall, we expect the financial services vertical to remain at lower volume levels until shelter-in-place orders are eased, allowing consumers to return to work and other normal activities. This could take several quarters. However, there are a few mitigating factors to highlight. First, mortgage refinancing should continue to be strong with most banks experiencing backlogs, as I mentioned previously. Second, we expect fraud mitigation solutions, like IDVision with iovation to perform well in this environment. We had experienced minimal impact to our fraud business thus far. They're having very constructive conversations with a wide range of lenders. As customers rapidly migrate homebound consumers to digital channels, lenders are concerned about in experiencing substantially increased incidences of fraud for login and verification. Our U.S. financial services is the largest in marketing for our products. The story is the same in many international markets, which I will discuss shortly. Third, we expect increased account management demand to continue as lenders look to more effectively service their existing customers. This will drive continued demand for more advanced solutions, including event triggers, printed data and alternative data. Finally, most of our contracts include volume minimums, and while they tend to be fairly low, there are valuable buffer. Contracts are also priced volumetrically, such as that as volume fall in the price per transaction rises, while this doesn't fully offset the lower volume, it does help. Now turning to our healthcare vertical, which helps healthcare providers navigate the revenue cycle to help improve the patient financial experience and maximize reimbursements for uncompensated care. The frontend of the cycle represents about one third of the revenue of the vertical and includes insurance eligibility checks, identity screens and payment estimation. As providers have shifted their focus to creating capacity in the healthcare system to prepare for the surge of COVID related patients, they canceled and delayed non-critical procedures. Although COVID cases will surge in hotspot areas, the overall impact on the healthcare system is a net decline in patient volumes. This started to impact the frontend business in late March, and we expect to see that decline persist through the second quarter. The other two thirds of this vertical is the back end of the revenue cycle, where we help providers identify opportunities to recover loss reimbursement through various revenue recovery products and services. Some examples include finding missing insurance information, resolving claim denials, and identifying Medicare bad debt dispersed reimbursement opportunities. By helping providers increase their revenue, reduce uncompensated care and avoid bad debt write offs, we provide a critical source of cash flow and in some cases provide essential products and services to assist providers in maintaining financial solvency. This is particularly important now, as the reduction in elective and preventative care is severely impacting providers' profitability. And while government stimulus programs are designed to help offset some of the impact, many providers are having to layoff and furlough staff. Writers may see additional pressure depending on how long the elective patient volumes are delay and how successful the reopening process is. Our current view is that consumer sentiment around comfort and safety are mixed at best reverting resuming normal healthcare elective treatments. Given the financial stress on healthcare providers, it's not surprising that the backend of our healthcare vertical has held up well thus far and provides providers and most providers, continue to be motivated and incented to continue their focus in this area to ensure they are optimizing their billing processes and recovering the greatest amount of reimbursement possible. The potential longer-term risk however, is that, there are fewer overall patients in the coming months in healthcare system, which could result in less overall opportunity for recovery of uncompensated care. In any scenario, our solutions continue to represent a valuable and essential part of the revenue cycle, helping providers reduce risk and increase their cash flow. Our insurance vertical serves property and casualty, life and commercial insurers with marketing and underwriting solutions as well as the analytics and investigative tools for claims. Thus far and in line with our expectations, insurance has seen a less severe impact than many other parts of our business. Unlike many other industries, insurances continue to provide services to their customers and to underwrite new business regardless of the broader economic conditions, particularly in auto insurance which is the largest part of our vertical. This connectivity level is driven by expiring policies, when consumers typically renew or shop for a new policy. In either case, customers use our data and solutions, only when the consumer chooses to let their policy lapse and not replace it does the industry see volume contraction. That is clearly a risk given the rising number of unemployed Americans and idle vehicles. However, we have seen many of the market leaders assisting their policyholders during this time through rebate programs. Core underwriting activity took an initial dip in mid-March, when shopping activity declined as consumers process the changes we've all experienced. However, in the recent weeks that trend has stabilized. Customer marketing programs thus far have continued as planned likely to help consumers understand the potential financial benefits of changing to a lower cost plan. In these economic conditions, consumers shop for lower rates to reduce their expenses. Furthermore, the desire to reduce costs and improve efficiency at our insurance customers is leading to increased interest in our drivers risk solutions. This solution helps to reduce the cost of motor vehicle reports, while providing more timely insights. Our team has stayed in close contact with our more than 300 insurance customers with heightened interaction with our top tier accounts. Our customer counterparts remain accessible and willing to engage in conversation about in-motion and new opportunities. We continue to leverage our market-leading capabilities to serve our insurance customers evolving needs. Turning our discussion of the U.S. market segment, I want to touch on a few other verticals, starting with collections. While we certainly see this vertical as counter-cyclical overtime, the initial negative impact has been quite severe for three reasons. First, many collections customers were not equipped to have their collectors work from home. This resulted in an immediate decline for several weeks, while collections firms developed capabilities to enable their workforce to work remotely. Second, in many states like New York and Nevada halted all collections activities for 30 day periods, and several other creditors have instructed agencies to suspend collection of their debt. And third, as part of the federal COVID legislation, certain consumers are being provided payment holidays. While we absolutely agree with and support the second two items as they provide relief to embattled consumers, these actions do create an air pocket in our business and push out resumption of normal collections activity by a few quarters. After that delinquent cases will be placed with collectors and activity should pick up over a three to six month period. In shifting to our public sector vertical which provides a variety of data driven solutions for federal state and local governments, at this point we have seen very modest impact. Government agencies continue to operate unabated and supportive of their constituents. Employees are largely able to work from home and are still engaged in ongoing business opportunities and open to new projects. We already provide fraud mitigation and identification solutions to certain agencies and we are in active discussions with them more broadly around the trillions of dollars in dispersals announced by the federal government. We're also talking to various agencies about heightened insider threat monitoring capabilities, as that risk increases when employees are homebound and might be facing financial hardships. Specific to combating COVID-19, we're also having productive conversations about providing federal agencies with right party contact information to support contact tracing. This is the process to identify and alert people who have been in close contact with an infected individual by contacting and monitoring those with a higher potential to become infected. Public health officials can reduce the spread of the virus by keeping them from infecting others. Having highly accurate right party contact data is critical for these efforts to be successful. Through TLOxp, we are well positioned to support these efforts. Conversely, we've seen a slowdown in some programs we support at the state level, but we've identified areas of potential upside where we can further support our customers and their COVID related mitigation work. As the preponderance of our underground COVID activity is taking place at the state level, our contacts are both distracted by these events and reluctant in some cases to proceed with certain activities like homestead tax act violations that may be viewed as of minor importance relative to the broader threat of COVID. We expect these activities to increase once the crisis has passed and states search for much needed revenue. At the same time, we do an opportunity to support COVID relief efforts with our background screening solutions. It is critically important that volunteers across all fields are properly vetted before engaging in these activities, as we've seen in previous large crises like Hurricane Katrina. Tenant screening is an area where we've seen a sharp slowdown as consumers are not actively seeking to move, often resigning with their current landlord instead of taking the risk of moving into a new location. Similarly, with a sharp reversal in employment trends, we're seeing employment screening slows substantially. We expect both of these areas to present opportunities as economic conditions improve and both moving and hiring increase. Finally, in telecom, we've also seen meaningful slowdown is more than 80% of cellular retail locations are closed, resulting in far fewer new plan and device sales along with the attendant credit checks that we provide. We expect this trend persists, so it may rebound very quickly as there's likely pent up consumer demand that will need to be satisfied when the lockdowns are lifted. Now turning to Consumer Interactive, consumers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring, and related financial education tools, like those that we offer both directly and indirectly through partners. Even as consumers were facing economic uncertainty and hardship. They're still demonstrating interest in the tools and resources that help them manage their credit health and drive informed decisions. As a result, today, we've seen only a modest negative impact to our direct subscriber base. We continue to tune our marketing efforts to maximize acquisition and retention of high quality subscribers. On the other hand, some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, likely resulting in decline in subscribers, which is the basis of our revenue model. Positively, we've had a number of substantive discussions with potential new partners that have expressed interest in building more robust consumer facing offerings, like financial education and modeling tools for their clients who may be facing difficult personal financial situations. Across our international markets, we have seen a pronounced slowdown, as lockdowns have been implemented in varying degrees of severity in all of our geographies. We're pleased to see that across all of our major markets, though, governments and lenders are providing relief for distressed consumers, as well as certain types of businesses. Our international teams have mobilized a swift response by providing customers with actionable insights that highlight differentiated solutions that we didn't have during the 2008 and 2009 crisis. These include credit vision trending data, credit view, market leading portfolio management insights, and fraud solutions. This approach has position our business at the forefront of enabling our clients to shift from originations to portfolio and risk management. In broad terms, we've seen developed markets like Canada, the UK and Hong Kong behave more likely the U.S. with meaningful declines across each country or regions portfolio. In the UK, lending markets are under similar stress as in the US, and that has and will weigh on our results. On a positive note, we've seen strong performance in several parts of our diversified portfolio. Fraud solutions, which are about one third of our UK business, are up significantly as consumers are accessing online services from government agencies that require authentication and identification. This trend will likely continue into the second quarter that will eventually taper off as all eligible consumers gain access to these sites. Our differentiated affordability suite is proving to be attractive to customers monitoring income shock, as unemployment has soared in the UK. Also in the UK, we recently won several critical government projects that focus on the health and financial welfare of UK consumers and businesses during the COVID crisis. In Canada thus far, it's looked more like the U.S. with a weak underlying lending market that we expect to continue while lockdowns remain in place. However, our first quarter results benefited from a number of breach remediation contracts that are not based on transactional inquiry volumes and thus are largely unaffected by COVID. This benefit will also continue into the second quarter. We also benefit from portfolio diversification that includes fraud solutions, direct-to-consumer offerings and insurance and government verticals. In particular, we see the heightened interest in our direct-to-consumer solutions as our customers seek to strengthen their relationships with their customers. In emerging markets, the impact has been worse as consumers rely more on branch and other in-person channels. Across almost all of these markets, we see a pronounced lack of digitization along with more aggressive government lockdown restrictions. In these geographies, more aggressive tactics have resulted in a greater impact on our business. In India, we have a fairly diversified portfolio that includes credit reports and scores, but also analytic and decisioning tools, fraud solutions, direct-to-consumer offerings and commercial credit business. Our broader portfolio provides a buffer to the dramatic declines we've seen in lending inquiry volumes. The stark drop in activity is a result of the challenges Indian consumers have in transacting online and the severity of their lockdown restrictions. In LatAm, we serve a variety of markets, and in general we've seen consumers challenged to transact remotely, while lockdowns have largely not been as strict as in some of our other markets. Notably in Brazil, we do not operate a credit bureau but rather a data analytics business that largely serves the insurance industry and that provides a modest buffer against the declining lending activity there. The South African economy was challenged prior to COVID and is now projected to be down low to mid single digits. Lockdown actions are less severe than countries like India and the Philippines. Our business in South Africa is diverse and has a large component that serves the insurance industry. In Hong Kong where we saw the impact of COVID the earliest, has stabilized at lower revenue run rate. We're encouraged to see that leveling off as the economy is slowly reopened. Our business has benefited from an increased focus on portfolio and risk management tools, fraud mitigation solutions and should be further aided overtime by the resumption of our direct-to-consumer channel in early April. Rounding out APAC, the Philippine is facing significant headwinds, much like India with a very aggressive lockdown program that has shuttered much of the economy. As we contemplate a recovery, we expect developed markets to have a faster rebound as these governments tend to have more capability and capacity to implement stimulus to drive economic growth. In light of the current situation, our new reality is that many of our markets are likely to face extended periods of lockdown or other social distancing. I will walk you through our new downturn playbook that proactively addresses the issues our customers face through a three phased approach. This is grounded in our understanding of these markets and our experience from past crises. Phase 1 is focused on understanding and serving our customers needs in the midst of the COVID crisis through our close partnership and engagement. We've increased our customer engagements to accurately identify and segment needs that drive tangible, easy-to-implement packages to support them. Given the immediacy of the needs, the packages use mostly existing capabilities assembled to directly address the current circumstances. Examples of this include advanced portfolio management that leverages our newest data assets, drivers first solutions that reduce costs and offer broader data to insurers, e-commerce fraud mitigation tools using both iovation and IDVision and income and spending reviews in some of our global markets. In the spirit along with others in the industry, we\u2019ve advocated for a continuation of clear and effective reporting of data so that customers and consumers remain confident in the data and are able to make well informed decisions in the future. We've also come together as an industry to uniformly increase consumers access to their credit reports at no charge from once per year to once per week during COVID crisis. Phase 2 of this program is focused on helping customers emerged from the COVID crisis, even as the timing will vary between markets and industries. In this phase, we will build new products to address specific industry and geographic needs. Some examples may include new models that incorporate post-COVID trended and alternative data attributes, integrated fraud and digital marketing solutions, and new underwriting frameworks. In both phases, we'll leverage our latest tools to support customers. For example, we can leverage our unique innovation lab to help customers work through their own specific projects using our data and our industry experts. In fact, we've already conducted virtual innovation labs with excellent customer feedback. In the past those occurred at our headquarters. These activities will all be coordinated on a global level so that we best leverage new practices and approaches throughout the Company. In Phase 3, we will address whatever new normal emerges from this crisis and we will ensure that our long-term planning reflects the new challenges and opportunities. While we believe that our long-term strategy is more relevant than ever, we will revisit it based on what we learn from Phases 1 and 2 of this downturn playbook. Our comprehensive approach addresses both the near term reality that we and our customers face while keeping TransUnion well positioned for future success. The next element of our downturn playbook involves managing our cost structure to adapt to both changing macro landscape and the impact it's having on our business. Like most companies, our traveling and entertainment expenses will drop substantially as we shelter-in-place. We're also maintaining our head count, freezing hiring with the exception of certain key strategic programs until we have better visibility into the shape and speed of the likely recovery. We've addressed some other discretionary costs by canceling internal meetings and prioritizing our capital spending. We have some additional opportunities to address costs and Todd will talk to you about these in a moment. We have quickly imprudently taken appropriate cost actions that are helping mitigate the impact on our margin even as revenues expected to decline sharply in the second quarter. Just to start down term playbook addresses our cost structure, we've also prioritized our investments to focus on innovation, operational efficiencies, and our celebrated technology investment, which we renamed project rise and we discussed in great detail during our last earnings call. We will continue to invest appropriately under the circumstances to support our customers as they deal with unprecedented market challenges while also taking steps to bolster our long-term growth prospects. The takeaway from these comments is that we are proactively working with customers and consumers to help them manage through the current environment while we manage our costs and prioritize our investments. This gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate the current situation, and the Company will be well positioned when markets rebound. Our strategy and portfolio positioning remain intact, allowing us to continue to deliver industry leading long-term top and bottom line growth. More specifically, we will still benefit from being innovators with attractive market positions across geographies and strategic verticals. We will still leverage our enterprise growth playbook to engage with clients to offer value added solutions. We will still possess the same powerful and proprietary and third-party data assets and we will still operate, and industry leading technology platform that is only going to get stronger through project rise. TransUnion culture will remain the same, focused on customers with individual accountability and performance, and we will continue to practice sound financial management and be good stewards of shareholder capital. That point marks a good transition for me to turn the call over to Todd, who will talk more about our strong balance sheet and cash flow position, our first quarter performance and our scenario based view of the second quarter. Over to you, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. First, I want to extend my best wishes to all of our associates, customers, consumers, investors and analysts. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Now to build off Chris' comments about the long-term health of our business, I want to start with and stress that we have a strong balance sheet and are taking all appropriate actions to ensure that remains the case going forward. We finished the quarter with $306 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we had a number of annual cash obligations, like bonus payouts, debt service and cash related to the vesting of restricted shares that limited our ability to conserve cash. However, for the foreseeable future, and until we better determine the depth and duration of the COVID crisis, we will focus on building cash on the balance sheet. As many of you know, in recent years, we've actively managed our portfolio of debt, leaving us in a very good position today. First, over the past roughly 16 months, we prepaid $400 million of debt. Second, last fall, we successfully refinanced our entire portfolio of debt resulting in lower interest expense and meaningfully extended terms with no scheduled maturities until December 2024. Third, in February, we have to execute in the new hedge instrument to replace the one that will expire in June of this year, thereby locking in very favorable interest rates for the next five years. And finally, we continue to have access to a $300 million undrawn revolver and we'll use that facility should we need it. In terms of debt covenants, only our revolver and term loan A, which represent $1.1 billion of our $3.6 billion of debt have restrictions related to our leverage ratio. That covenant stipulates that the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA must not exceed 5.5 times on a trailing 12 month basis. Our leverage ratio was 3.1 times at the end of the first quarter. We test our ratio at least quarterly and we currently have no concerns that we would breach our leverage covenant. Turning to our priorities for cash, they are to run the business without interruption in all geographies, service our debt, continue to invest as Chris discussed, pay our dividend and retain excess cash. There are a few considerations regarding our capital allocation. First, we don't expect to prepay that or buyback shares in the current environment. Second, while we are comfortable paying this dividend at this time, if circumstances deteriorate meaningfully, beyond what we currently are able to forecast, then we would consider recommending that our Board temporarily reduce or suspending, but I want to be transparent about our thinking. Thinking together, we have a strong balance sheet and have proactively positioned the Company to weather these challenging times. Going forward, we are committed to taking all prudent actions to preserve our liquidity. I'll now walk you through our consolidated results, and for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the first quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise, and all revenue discussions relate to adjusted revenue. Starting with the income statement. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Revenue from acquisitions contributed slightly about less than half a point of growth in the quarter related to the May 2019 acquisition of TruSignal, so organic growth in constant currency would have grown 11%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.3%, flat with the year ago quarter. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS grew 22%, with a 23.6% adjusted tax rate. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. market's revenue grew 14%. The impact of the TruSignal acquisition had a nominal impact. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 22% on a reported and organic basis. As Chris mentioned, we experienced very strong overall trends in this vertical through mid March, particularly related to mortgage refinancing activity. In fact, without the benefit of unusually strong mortgage volumes, financial services revenue would have still grown approximately 13% to 14%. Emerging verticals combined grew 6% and 5% on an organic basis, and were tracking even better through mid-March. Insurance, healthcare and public sector were particularly strong, a number of the sub-segments of our diversified markets businesses, notably collections, telco, tenant and employment screening were weaker as COVID affected these end markets rapidly and severely beginning in mid March. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. margins increased 21% on both the reported and organic basis. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 9%. As we mentioned at our February call, we divested at small business in the UK called Recipero. Excluding that divestiture, international revenue would have grown 10%. Regional results were negatively impacted by COVID. Nonetheless, we still saw mid teens growth in several markets. In Canada, we benefited from a number of one time breach remediation opportunities with our customers as Chris previously mentioned. In India, we had anticipated lower than normal revenue growth, as we were comparing against 51% growth in the year ago first quarter, and we were still close to our expectations of mid teens growth. UK grew 7% and 10% excluding the impact of divesting called Recipero. We saw growth in all of their markets including Asia Pacific which includes Hong Kong where the impact of COVID was experienced the earliest and longest during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 4% as a result of weaker than expected revenue due to COVID driven lockdowns and the comparison to a reversal of reserves in the year ago quarter. Consumer active revenue increased 3% driven by growth in both the indirect and direct channels. Adjusted EBITDA for consumer active was down 5%, as we increased marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and continue to see good returns on that investment. As Chris mentioned earlier, given considerable uncertainty about the impact of COVID across all our geographic and vertical markets, at this time it is prudent to suspend full year 2020 guidance related to revenue, EBITDA and diluted EPS. Overtime, we will revisit this decision and at the appropriate time with sufficient visibility reinstate full year of guidance. Given this decision, I wanted to comment on the three year outlook that we provided in March of 2019, at that time, we indicated that we would grow revenue on average 7% per year from 2019 to 2021. That outlook contemplated a normal U.S centered recession, but not a global pandemic with truly unique characteristics. And such, the view that we could grow and hold margins through that sort of normal recession southern hold up in the current environment. Actual revenue growth in 2019, the first year of that outlook was stronger than the average up 9%, and now it seems highly probable that 2020 is going to be below the average, and it is surely too soon to make a call on 2021 as we have so little clarity about the potential depth and duration of the COVID crisis. We will provide an update in the future as we gain additional clarity. Now, I do want to offer some directional thoughts about some of our annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be lower than the previous guidance of 25.5%, as a result of lower forecasted foreign earnings and lower state taxes due to lower forecasted domestic earnings. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be lower than the previous guidance of $375 million. Excluding the step up and subsequent M&A portion, depreciation and amortization should be lower than the $180 million we provided last quarter. The change is primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a projected reduction in overall capital expenditures. Third, net interest expense should be lower compared to our previous guidance of $140 million as a result of a reduction of the forward LIBOR curve. And finally, while capital expenditures may still be around 8% of revenue in 2020, this will be on a lower base and not the lower absolute dollar spend than we previously expected. Turning to the second quarter of 2020, like many companies, the lack of visibility and certainty resulting from COVID means that we were unable to provide the more specific guidance we normally do. Instead, we believe that providing you with the range of potential outcomes, along with the scenarios around each is far more instructive and valuable at this time. And to state the obvious, scenarios like these are not predictions about what is likely to happen rather they are intended to help you frame possible outcomes. On our call today, we provided additional detailed trend information to illustrate how COVID has impacted TransUnion. We expect to continue to offer these details during the pandemic to help investors. We've spent considerable time with every business over the past month and a half as the COVID situation is unfolding. These conversations are focused on identifying quantifying, and mitigating risks, while also addressing cost containment actions, investment prioritization, and marketplace plans to support our customers and consumers. We believe that the scenarios represent is our best possible view based on the information trend analysis and marketplace intelligence that we have available right now. The base case is a continuation of the trend Chris previously outlined. We provided you with daily volumes for our financial services and markets, additional comments on other major verticals and all our geographic markets. These serve as a starting point for the scenarios that I will take you through. If these terms hold, we believe that adjusted revenue would decline 13% to 18%. There is about one point of FX headwind that we're facing this quarter. At the segment level, we would expect the U.S. markets would be down mid teens percent, international declined below 20%, and Consumer Interactive would be down mid single digits. Adjusted EBITDA would fall 33%to 38% also with one point of FX headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS would likely decline more than adjusted EBITDA due to the adjusted EBIT of dollar decline, having a larger percentage impact on adjusted diluted EPS, which is only partially offset by lower interest expense and tax rate. I want to spend a minute here building on Chris's comments about cost mitigation. When we think about addressable or discretionary costs, we think more broadly than just fixed versus variable. We think about four categories. The first two, variable product costs and non-variable product costs relate to changes up or down in our revenue base and track very closely to that. The third is depreciation and amortization, which we have little ability to affect in the short term. The fourth are fixed costs and we have addressed certain portions of this group as Chris discussed with a plan to address certain other areas further, if necessary. I don't want to get into specifics at this point but we'll provide you details if we need to travel that path. Wrapping up the base case scenario, we wouldn't expect any liquidity issues and cash on the balance sheet would remain relatively stable. Leverage, which is calculated as net debt over trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, would rise slightly but be at or under a three and a half times, and very far from the 5.5 times covenant trigger I mentioned earlier. Furthermore, in this scenario, we would currently expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA declines to moderate through the back half of the year, assuming the recovery unfolds in a somewhat linear fashion. The upside case is formulated often earlier albeit at slow start to the recovery in May or June. If that were the scenario, we wouldn't have anticipate revenue falling less than 10% and adjusted EBITDA the declining less than 25%. And again, adjusted diluted EPS would likely be worse than adjusted EBITDA. Cash on the balance sheet would actually build slightly and leverage would increase only modestly. The downside case contemplates a meaningful deterioration in the trends that we've articulated, that would result in adjusted revenue declining more than 20% and adjusted EBITDA following more than 45% with the adjusted diluted EPS again down by a larger percentage. In this case, we would use cash on the balance sheet and would have additional discretionary actions available if necessary. So to wrap up, despite the challenges from COVID that we faced late in the quarter, we delivered good results that reflect the strong momentum we achieved prior to social distancing requirements. We have now turned our attention to managing through unprecedented times and believe the strength of our business and our balance sheet will allow us to weather this situation. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Thanks, Todd. So to conclude this morning, we've laid out a comprehensive, transparent and realistic view of our business and of the markets that we serve. We've outlined our plans to proactively address the situation with our cost structure and in the investments that we're making for the near and long-term. While we clearly will face some short-term challenges, our portfolio and strategy remain intact and will be as powerful and differentiated after the COVID pandemic as they were before. Most importantly, we're going to continue to prioritize the health and wellbeing of all of our associates and of the broader communities in which we operate in globally. And with that, I'll turn it back to Aaron. Thank you.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks Chris, and that concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question, so that we can include more participants and for now we will be glad to take those questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Bank. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: My question was more just around the tech investment program, the innovation product, new product spend, just in terms of how you think the different scenarios impact that, and how you shift into maybe a different focus versus what was said before?\nChris Cartwright: This is Chris, Manav. Good morning. I'll handle that question first but just a quick caveat. You know, obviously Todd and I and Erin are doing this from home, so if there's any pause or awkwardness in the handling of the questions, it's just due to that fact. As I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in the strategically critical initiatives that we had talked about in the last earnings call and in various investor relations communications we've done. Over the last quarter of last year, the acceleration of our tech investments, our evolution, if you will, is foremost among those. It is part an acceleration of the migration of certain apps to the cloud. But as I also mentioned, it was the implementation of streamline technology architecture, across our core product portfolio as well as just a reduction of some of the sprawl that has accumulated through the years and around the world. As our revenues decline starting in mid-March, we looked at the expense base, we prioritized our capital spending, and we maintained a good level of spend in this area because we feel like we can execute very effectively in a work from home environment. And of course it's important for our medium-term and long-term success. It'll do a lot for positive development agility. It'll also reduce our cost structure. So in this base case that we've outlined in our operating to expect us to continue to invest in this program, we may not do it as aggressively, at least in the initial month or so until we get more confidence around the level of revenues that we're going to have. And of course, if we saw a material worsening in the environment, we would have to look at this area and other areas like personnel overall to determine how to appropriately size those investments. But we want to maintain the program, we think it's important and we also continue to invest in new innovation, I can think of half a dozen major product categories that have good plans being executed to strengthen our positions. And again, I think we can execute effectively in these areas, in this work from home environment. In fact, I have to say overall, our workforce has adapted very quickly to working from home. I am really comfortable in the level of service that we're delivering our clients and folks are engaged and productive.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Hey guys. Good morning. Hope you're all well. Chris, you mentioned a couple of times the concept of extended recovery number of your markets. Acknowledging that there's a lot of uncertainty remaining in the duration of the impact here, can you just help us think through maybe what within the portfolio you think could recover more quickly or where you might see that concept of extended recovery to be the most acute?\nChris Cartwright: Okay, fair enough. Let me start at an overall level, we've had a lot of detail around our transactional volume performance, particularly in the U.S. markets. I believe that in the international markets, which are largely in countries with emerging economies, those countries went into deep shelter in place policies, probably a week or two weeks after the U.S. and so the downturn there has been a bit more pronounced. And I think that will probably be another couple of weeks or so before and again, I hope we see the type of stabilization and even recovery that we're seeing in the U.S. There are also some challenges and some of those markets where there's not the same degree of internet connectivity or digital penetration in general in consumer lending and originations and all of that, so it could be a little bit curtailed until a lockout ease and physical movement is again possible. But I do know really across all the countries in our portfolio, we see adaptations to the current circumstances, which I think bode well for volumes in the future. In terms of particular categories that would rebound and I think auto lending will rebound because folks will be able to visit dealers, even if they have to implement social distancing approaches. But right now, that's been a considerable lockdown, new home purchases could benefit as well. I think consumer lending, which has endured I think the most pronounced impact of the different lending subcategories. Once those lenders get a sense of the performance of their own portfolio and in the current employment situation, and the impact that they stimulus from the federal government is having, that's a category that could also bounce back. I think collections activity in the coming quarters could increase substantially. I like the way we're positioned in that space from a product and a capabilities perspective, but as I mentioned in my comments. collectors weren't geared up to work from home and there's a collection hiatus in place, but I do think that in the coming quarters lenders will have to collect on delinquencies and you'll see quite a resurgence in those activities.\nOperator: Excuse me. This is the conference operator. I apologize for the technical problem there. If you'd like, I can go to the next question from Toni Kaplan, if you wish.\nAaron Hoffman: Please.\nOperator: Thank you. Toni Kaplan. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Congrats on the strong quarter and glad to hear that you're all safe. My questions regarding the guidance, I can understand wanting to be conservative, especially in the middle of such an uncertain time. And I know others have framed this in a similar way, but why is it your base case at the current trends remained for the full quarter in the second quarter, if states and countries start to open up? Just maybe if possible, if you could frame the likelihood around the different cases that you've provided here. Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: I'm going to pass it over to Todd, but who I think can take us through the detail in our thinking and you are looking for some kind of probability I think of A, B or C. So with that, let me pass it over to Todd.\nTodd Cello: Hey, good morning, Toni, and thank you for your question in regards to the outlook scenarios that we are providing. As you know, the base case is showing, we are taking the current trends that we are seeing in our U.S. markets business as well as international and Consumer Interactive and running those trends out. But as you can imagine, those trends are different in every one of the end markets that we operate. And so, in particular you can see that within the online volumes that we've provided for our U.S. markets, financial services business, you can see that just the disparity between those in those groups. And you can also see that when you look at the commentary that we've provided for our international business on as wall to where you see, relative downturns in places, developed markets like Canada and the UK. So maybe things are a little bit more pronounced on emerging geographies like India and Latin America. So I think the important takeaway in the base case is that we are assuming, we're not necessarily assuming linear for everybody, we do have different assumptions in that base case, as to when those markets will see some type of recovery. So, internally, we are going through a very detailed bottom drop forecasting process that we put in place in mid-March. So each of the segment presidents and their respect to finance teams are presenting to me and Chris on a weekly basis, what those trends are. So, we have a good sense as to where things are going to ebb and flow. And I think you'll Chris already really kind of answered just like what are markets that we would expect to come back, sooner rather than later. So that's the base case and that's what we see today. I mean, we give you the day that through April the 24th as well in the U.S market. So, we tried to extend on that as far as we could and we're being optimistic that these trends are, will continue. However, we're not certain just like anybody else, what the implication of that is going to be. So that's why we thought it would be a prudent approach to provide the scenarios on that. So if you believe that the outlook that we're providing in our base case is not optimistic enough, that is why we've provided you with an upside case. We're not necessarily there at that point right now. And to be balanced, we put in a downside scenario as well to, just in the event that what we are experiencing right now. There is further deterioration or maybe there is second surge of cases, we just don\u2019t know and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken approach that have. So, let me pass it back to Chris for some other comments on that.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I just realized from Todd\u2019s comment there that I forgot to answer part of an earlier question, which is our perspective on the nature of a recovery, there's talk of V shape, L shape, U shape et cetera. I think we feel like it's going to look something like a Nike swoosh, where the descent was pretty rapid and then there'll be a slow and measured rate of improvement over time, but with some ups and downs along that trend line. And that's because, this is an economic crisis that's brought about by health crisis. And we're still having to manage within the constraints of our ability, to deal with the health crisis, and it's not as if we're all going to be able to just resume our normal social and economic behavior that had produced the growth that we were enjoying. It's going to take some time, it's going to have to be measured, and we're going to have to really get some disease transmission and treatment and all under control before we can get back to the way things were.\nToni Kaplan: Would you be willing to give probabilities on the scenarios or no?\nTodd Cello: Well, I think we've given you our best thinking on this, and I feel pretty good that this is very comprehensive as to how we're thinking about it internally and we're literally sharing with you, what we're thinking right now. So, I mean, as I said, I think we'd be remiss to say our entire probability based on any of these scenarios. Again, that's why we get into the trends but we bid to serve as a foundation to anchor losses.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Just I guess a clarifying question on how you're characterizing kind of the stabilization or recovering relative to the trend data that you gave us. And, I guess in my view is from looking at the graphs or the checks that you gave us is that, the year-over-year declines generally look like they're narrowing or improving across most of the U.S. financial markets. Products, you're talking about stabilization. So, I guess, just are you basically saying that there was this period of extreme freeze, a stay at home was implemented and then since then, they've been stable in recent weeks, just trying to understand why you're seeing stabilization and year-over-year to be getting better? And then this specific number that you gave us in those charts. Is that April month to-date year-over-year trend? Or is that the April 24th specific daily volumes? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Okay, so we'll tag team on this question. But just to clarify our language, just because we say stabilization doesn't mean flat lined, necessarily, it probably just means more. It's not declining and it's either flat improving. If you look at the trend over the past 10 plus business days, we see flat to improving in all of those financial services markets, which is encouraging and we're looking at our volume trends every day from markets around the world. And so much of the earlier question while we're not getting probabilities, we do feel good about our base case and that is what we are managing towards currently, but we are prepared to pivot prepared to pivot and manage each of the cases that we outlined. As for the April question, let me hand it to Todd\nTodd Cello: Good question, and they sort of clarification on that. So, what the graphs are depicting and the volume decline is a comparison of April 24 of 2022, the prior year. So, it's not meant to be your summary of the trend or whatever it is. It's just the point in time where we were at the end of last week, and where volumes were on that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Todd, could you just tell us in the base case scenario when the Company says continuation of current trends? Are you using that last week number year-over-year like you just referred to? Or are you assuming all of April's trends on average continue year-over-year in May and June?\nTodd Cello: Hey, Andrew, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes, that's a good clarifying point to me too. So, we are when we extrapolate on trends forward, we are looking at the most recent data. We're not necessarily going back and looking at an average of the month of April as an example, but we are looking at maybe the most recent week and we're not as granular as saying, Oh, well, Friday was this, Friday the 24th is this. So, then that must mean every day is going to be like that going forward. There are some sensitivities on that we put into it. So, by and large what we're turning forward for May and June assumptions are taking the current volumes that we've been seeing over the last week.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hey, good morning gentlemen. I appreciate you taking the question. Trended data have obviously been a pretty important driver for TransUnion over the last few years. And Todd -- sorry, Chris, you've made some interesting comments about demand for trended data. Can you opine a in a little bit on perhaps -- and I'm thinking even in emerging markets, how trended data might help risk management competencies to your customers? Is that something as we come out of this that could be a structural demand driver?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. I think so. I mean, look, one of the, we've talked a lot about trended data through the years and on these calls, and we've succeeded in pushing it to many of the markets in which we operate around the world. And we think it's going to be especially helpful for understanding the risk of existing portfolios, and even, new client acquisition in this more limited environment. One of the data attributes, that's going to be especially helpful for lenders is, what we call aggregate excess payments. And overtime what we can see is, the amount of debt service in excess of the minimum required that consumers are making, and I think that speaks to several factors, that speaks to revenue or income and expenses getting to some type of a consumer free cash flow measure, if you will. And then it speaks to their behavior, their propensity to service, their data take care of it, which is more of a behavioral characteristic, and I think lenders will look at that when doing their portfolio reviews. We're also coming up with new attributes that we've already rolled out that are helping with more current signal. So, we're looking at how consumer trade lines are being reported in this environment, and we're able to characterize of those that has forbearance or other hardship relationships and disaster recovery codes, and that's an incremental current signal that all will go and help toward the risk assessment of the current portfolio. On top of that, there's some signal in our alternative data sets where prior mainstream consumers are now dipping into the payday loan market, that could be an indication that. And also any negative demand deposit activity. We're fortunate in that we're able to see bounce checks in any other negative activity on demand deposit accounts nationwide in the U.S. In some of our other markets, we actually get current income information from the major banks and we have pioneered that product in the UK, it's part of a debt leverage ratio that we have put out in the market for many years now that helped banks determine which consumers will likely need some assistance in meeting their obligations.\nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Weber of RBC. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning and thanks for all the information. I'm just curious about -- you have two markets, you have Hong Kong and the U.S. that are kind of starting to better stabilize. Again, can you just talk to any parallels that you've seen between, I guess Hong Kong was first and relative to the U.S.? And any parallels or differences in just how those markets have stabilized and started to recover? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure. I think I'll back clean up on this one because you know, before he was the CFO of all TransUnion, Todd was CFO of International, and he had great detail on these markets. So, Todd why don\u2019t you fill them on the Hong Kong experience.\nTodd Cello: Okay. Seth, thanks for the question and happy to get into a little bit of the details. I guess what comes to mind when you asked that question about parallels to Hong Kong in the U.S., I guess first thing I think of is under very different businesses. So our business in Hong Kong is predominantly focused on financial services and we've branched out in some other verticals like direct to consumer. There's one example, but the U.S. it's more of a broad based portfolio as I'm sure you can appreciate. So, the other difference in Hong Kong is the way that the data is consumed. It's by and large purchased on a portfolio basis, so meaning in batches as opposed to just one off online credit reports on transactions. We do have that type of business in Hong Kong but predominantly the business that we have in Hong Kong is a lot more predictable because of the batch for that we do. So when we look at how that market has performed, because of that mix of business and the predictability of it, we didn't see such a steep downturn initially from it. But then conversely on the way back, I've seen big uptick as well too. And I think it's just the really important thing is just remember how different these markets are and how, how credit can be used in that. Well, obviously in the U.S, we're in the midst of it and I hope we've given you some good color, the trends that we're seeing and then answering the previous questions we have talked about what we feel like the recoveries are going to look like in various end markets. So Chris, I'll hand it back to you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, just two quick comments. I mean, I guess in summary, the difference in the product mix that we have or the weighting of the product mix in Hong Kong lends itself to stability. And you know that business has held up pretty well over the past year or 18 months. I mean, initially we had the protests and political instability, which caused some curtailment. And then we had the unfortunate fraud situation in our direct to consumer business, which took that offline and then of course the pandemic. All that said though, it's still a strong business and it's also just giving us insight as to how this pandemic and also the recovery may develop. Our employees have been going back to the office in Hong Kong, but in a measured and limited way and we've got the A teams and the B teams and we've extended the work day, we stagger some shifts. We only have one team in the office per day and we try to limit it to those that really need to be in the office. We've got a direct to consumer window that we have to manage. They're in Hong Kong. So, it's a little bit unique and frankly employees we're ready to get out and about and that's what I would expect is going to happen here in the U.S. We're just doing, we're just a few weeks or more behind that.\nOperator: The next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Mihalos: I just wanted to delve in a little bit more on the international side. Just serious, if you have anything similar in terms of updated friends at a country level to what you sort of laid out in the financial services segment and maybe to the extent you can get that granular. If we look at the base case assumptions for cue international down kind of in the low 20s. Can you maybe help ballpark for us, what geographies you're expecting to do worse than that or trending worse than that and which ones are doing better? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: George, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. So, again I think I'd refer you back to the slide that we pulled together to depict kind of our sentiments on the international business and where we think things are now going to where the impact is now and where they will return. In particular, I think I answered this as well, too, when we look at more developed type of countries like the UK and in Canada, they have shelter in place that's similar to the U.S. So, the impact is relatively about the same as if what we're seeing. I think it's more the emerging geographies, as I alluded to previously in India, and Latin America, where the lockdowns are a little bit more severe on that we've seen more of an impact in the short term on that. So, the reason that, if you go to the base case, you'll also notice that we are providing an outlook for each of our segments so for the U.S. markets for international and Consumer Interactive. And we typically don't do that as you know, and the reason that we did that was to just simply give you a perspective as to how we are thinking, each of the businesses are going to perform. So, specific to your question on international when we talked about it's being down mid as low 20s in the second quarter, we're taking into consideration all the points that I just made and the trends from that we have articulated on that on the slide for each major geographies.\nOperator: Next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Just sticking with international, quick question on that, I think you talked quite a bit about the different components of those businesses that add diversification outside of the core financial services business. Is it possible to ballpark what those kind of cyclical or maybe acyclical businesses represent, as a percentage of the total international business mix in the aggregate? Thanks.\nTodd Cello: Yes. Hi, Andrew, if I understand your question, I think, you're looking for in the international portfolio where we would have countercyclical plays. I mean, is that right?\nAndrew Nicholas: Yes. Just trying to get a sense for the size of maybe that portfolio diversification column on slide 12, or just kind of a ballpark of what might not be as heavily influenced by the economic trend.\nTodd Cello: Yes. I guess it's a general, general statement overall is that, I think, when we've talked to in the past about us having businesses that were countercyclical, we weren't necessarily contemplating a global pandemic, when we made those comments. And so, if you think back to discussions that we've had in the past about how changing who would perform in a recessionary environment, we talked about businesses like insurance and healthcare in the U.S. would be countercyclical, and our geographic footprint internationally would help us. Kind of unfortunately, what we're experiencing right now is broad-based, even the countercyclical plays as we've already articulated are down, maybe they're not down as much. But nevertheless, they still are. Specific to your question on international, I would say that, predominantly on those businesses our Financial Services focus with some exceptions. So, right, we've done fairly good jobs diversifying the business in Canada is one of your ample outside of Financial Services is meaningful positions on an insurance and a public sector as well as in direct-to-consumer. I would say that, our business in South Africa is diversified in the UK as well too. But predominantly, those geographies are a heavy on Financial Services.\nOperator: And the last question today will come from Bill Warmington, excuse me, Warmington of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBill Warmington: Thank you very much. I've been called worse. So, thank you for making me in here at the end.\nAaron Hoffman: No problem, Bill.\nBill Warmington: So, you've mentioned Consumer Interactive is trending down mid-single digits, how is that trending for direct versus indirect? I think both trending mid single digit or is one channel doing significantly better than the other?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. I'll start with this and without putting specific numbers on it, we're seeing the direct part of our business hold up pretty well. Consumers value the service and they are keenly focused on their financial management, right now, and that's encouraging and we're maintaining our marketing spend, our marketing returns are very acceptable, and we're going to continue to grow that segment of the business. On the indirect side, it's a little bit tougher sledding, if you will. Most of the revenue comes from lead aggregation business models. And because Financial Services right now is paused a little bit in terms of new client acquisition or the volume of activity is greatly diminished, our revenues from that segment have been more challenged than the direct side. But overall, the direct to consumer segment is performing quite nicely and we're encouraged by it.\nAaron Hoffman: Great, and that's going to bring us to the end of the call. We thank everyone for their time today and we want to just reiterate, we hope everyone is healthy and safe and continues to be. So let's have a very good day, all the best from TransUnion. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. First, I want to extend my best wishes to all of our associates, customers, consumers, investors and analysts. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. Now to build off Chris' comments about the long-term health of our business, I want to start with and stress that we have a strong balance sheet and are taking all appropriate actions to ensure that remains the case going forward. We finished the quarter with $306 million of cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we had a number of annual cash obligations, like bonus payouts, debt service and cash related to the vesting of restricted shares that limited our ability to conserve cash. However, for the foreseeable future, and until we better determine the depth and duration of the COVID crisis, we will focus on building cash on the balance sheet. As many of you know, in recent years, we've actively managed our portfolio of debt, leaving us in a very good position today. First, over the past roughly 16 months, we prepaid $400 million of debt. Second, last fall, we successfully refinanced our entire portfolio of debt resulting in lower interest expense and meaningfully extended terms with no scheduled maturities until December 2024. Third, in February, we have to execute in the new hedge instrument to replace the one that will expire in June of this year, thereby locking in very favorable interest rates for the next five years. And finally, we continue to have access to a $300 million undrawn revolver and we'll use that facility should we need it. In terms of debt covenants, only our revolver and term loan A, which represent $1.1 billion of our $3.6 billion of debt have restrictions related to our leverage ratio. That covenant stipulates that the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA must not exceed 5.5 times on a trailing 12 month basis. Our leverage ratio was 3.1 times at the end of the first quarter. We test our ratio at least quarterly and we currently have no concerns that we would breach our leverage covenant. Turning to our priorities for cash, they are to run the business without interruption in all geographies, service our debt, continue to invest as Chris discussed, pay our dividend and retain excess cash. There are a few considerations regarding our capital allocation. First, we don't expect to prepay that or buyback shares in the current environment. Second, while we are comfortable paying this dividend at this time, if circumstances deteriorate meaningfully, beyond what we currently are able to forecast, then we would consider recommending that our Board temporarily reduce or suspending, but I want to be transparent about our thinking. Thinking together, we have a strong balance sheet and have proactively positioned the Company to weather these challenging times. Going forward, we are committed to taking all prudent actions to preserve our liquidity. I'll now walk you through our consolidated results, and for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the first quarter of 2019 unless noted otherwise, and all revenue discussions relate to adjusted revenue. Starting with the income statement. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Revenue from acquisitions contributed slightly about less than half a point of growth in the quarter related to the May 2019 acquisition of TruSignal, so organic growth in constant currency would have grown 11%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% on a reported basis and 11% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 38.3%, flat with the year ago quarter. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS grew 22%, with a 23.6% adjusted tax rate. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. market's revenue grew 14%. The impact of the TruSignal acquisition had a nominal impact. Our financial services vertical revenue grew 22% on a reported and organic basis. As Chris mentioned, we experienced very strong overall trends in this vertical through mid March, particularly related to mortgage refinancing activity. In fact, without the benefit of unusually strong mortgage volumes, financial services revenue would have still grown approximately 13% to 14%. Emerging verticals combined grew 6% and 5% on an organic basis, and were tracking even better through mid-March. Insurance, healthcare and public sector were particularly strong, a number of the sub-segments of our diversified markets businesses, notably collections, telco, tenant and employment screening were weaker as COVID affected these end markets rapidly and severely beginning in mid March. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. margins increased 21% on both the reported and organic basis. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 9%. As we mentioned at our February call, we divested at small business in the UK called Recipero. Excluding that divestiture, international revenue would have grown 10%. Regional results were negatively impacted by COVID. Nonetheless, we still saw mid teens growth in several markets. In Canada, we benefited from a number of one time breach remediation opportunities with our customers as Chris previously mentioned. In India, we had anticipated lower than normal revenue growth, as we were comparing against 51% growth in the year ago first quarter, and we were still close to our expectations of mid teens growth. UK grew 7% and 10% excluding the impact of divesting called Recipero. We saw growth in all of their markets including Asia Pacific which includes Hong Kong where the impact of COVID was experienced the earliest and longest during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for international declined 4% as a result of weaker than expected revenue due to COVID driven lockdowns and the comparison to a reversal of reserves in the year ago quarter. Consumer active revenue increased 3% driven by growth in both the indirect and direct channels. Adjusted EBITDA for consumer active was down 5%, as we increased marketing behind the direct channel during the quarter and continue to see good returns on that investment. As Chris mentioned earlier, given considerable uncertainty about the impact of COVID across all our geographic and vertical markets, at this time it is prudent to suspend full year 2020 guidance related to revenue, EBITDA and diluted EPS. Overtime, we will revisit this decision and at the appropriate time with sufficient visibility reinstate full year of guidance. Given this decision, I wanted to comment on the three year outlook that we provided in March of 2019, at that time, we indicated that we would grow revenue on average 7% per year from 2019 to 2021. That outlook contemplated a normal U.S centered recession, but not a global pandemic with truly unique characteristics. And such, the view that we could grow and hold margins through that sort of normal recession southern hold up in the current environment. Actual revenue growth in 2019, the first year of that outlook was stronger than the average up 9%, and now it seems highly probable that 2020 is going to be below the average, and it is surely too soon to make a call on 2021 as we have so little clarity about the potential depth and duration of the COVID crisis. We will provide an update in the future as we gain additional clarity. Now, I do want to offer some directional thoughts about some of our annual guidance items. First, we expect our tax rate to be lower than the previous guidance of 25.5%, as a result of lower forecasted foreign earnings and lower state taxes due to lower forecasted domestic earnings. Second, total depreciation and amortization is expected to be lower than the previous guidance of $375 million. Excluding the step up and subsequent M&A portion, depreciation and amortization should be lower than the $180 million we provided last quarter. The change is primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates and a projected reduction in overall capital expenditures. Third, net interest expense should be lower compared to our previous guidance of $140 million as a result of a reduction of the forward LIBOR curve. And finally, while capital expenditures may still be around 8% of revenue in 2020, this will be on a lower base and not the lower absolute dollar spend than we previously expected. Turning to the second quarter of 2020, like many companies, the lack of visibility and certainty resulting from COVID means that we were unable to provide the more specific guidance we normally do. Instead, we believe that providing you with the range of potential outcomes, along with the scenarios around each is far more instructive and valuable at this time. And to state the obvious, scenarios like these are not predictions about what is likely to happen rather they are intended to help you frame possible outcomes. On our call today, we provided additional detailed trend information to illustrate how COVID has impacted TransUnion. We expect to continue to offer these details during the pandemic to help investors. We've spent considerable time with every business over the past month and a half as the COVID situation is unfolding. These conversations are focused on identifying quantifying, and mitigating risks, while also addressing cost containment actions, investment prioritization, and marketplace plans to support our customers and consumers. We believe that the scenarios represent is our best possible view based on the information trend analysis and marketplace intelligence that we have available right now. The base case is a continuation of the trend Chris previously outlined. We provided you with daily volumes for our financial services and markets, additional comments on other major verticals and all our geographic markets. These serve as a starting point for the scenarios that I will take you through. If these terms hold, we believe that adjusted revenue would decline 13% to 18%. There is about one point of FX headwind that we're facing this quarter. At the segment level, we would expect the U.S. markets would be down mid teens percent, international declined below 20%, and Consumer Interactive would be down mid single digits. Adjusted EBITDA would fall 33%to 38% also with one point of FX headwinds. Adjusted diluted EPS would likely decline more than adjusted EBITDA due to the adjusted EBIT of dollar decline, having a larger percentage impact on adjusted diluted EPS, which is only partially offset by lower interest expense and tax rate. I want to spend a minute here building on Chris's comments about cost mitigation. When we think about addressable or discretionary costs, we think more broadly than just fixed versus variable. We think about four categories. The first two, variable product costs and non-variable product costs relate to changes up or down in our revenue base and track very closely to that. The third is depreciation and amortization, which we have little ability to affect in the short term. The fourth are fixed costs and we have addressed certain portions of this group as Chris discussed with a plan to address certain other areas further, if necessary. I don't want to get into specifics at this point but we'll provide you details if we need to travel that path. Wrapping up the base case scenario, we wouldn't expect any liquidity issues and cash on the balance sheet would remain relatively stable. Leverage, which is calculated as net debt over trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA, would rise slightly but be at or under a three and a half times, and very far from the 5.5 times covenant trigger I mentioned earlier. Furthermore, in this scenario, we would currently expect revenue and adjusted EBITDA declines to moderate through the back half of the year, assuming the recovery unfolds in a somewhat linear fashion. The upside case is formulated often earlier albeit at slow start to the recovery in May or June. If that were the scenario, we wouldn't have anticipate revenue falling less than 10% and adjusted EBITDA the declining less than 25%. And again, adjusted diluted EPS would likely be worse than adjusted EBITDA. Cash on the balance sheet would actually build slightly and leverage would increase only modestly. The downside case contemplates a meaningful deterioration in the trends that we've articulated, that would result in adjusted revenue declining more than 20% and adjusted EBITDA following more than 45% with the adjusted diluted EPS again down by a larger percentage. In this case, we would use cash on the balance sheet and would have additional discretionary actions available if necessary. So to wrap up, despite the challenges from COVID that we faced late in the quarter, we delivered good results that reflect the strong momentum we achieved prior to social distancing requirements. We have now turned our attention to managing through unprecedented times and believe the strength of our business and our balance sheet will allow us to weather this situation. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Hey, good morning, Toni, and thank you for your question in regards to the outlook scenarios that we are providing. As you know, the base case is showing, we are taking the current trends that we are seeing in our U.S. markets business as well as international and Consumer Interactive and running those trends out. But as you can imagine, those trends are different in every one of the end markets that we operate. And so, in particular you can see that within the online volumes that we've provided for our U.S. markets, financial services business, you can see that just the disparity between those in those groups. And you can also see that when you look at the commentary that we've provided for our international business on as wall to where you see, relative downturns in places, developed markets like Canada and the UK. So maybe things are a little bit more pronounced on emerging geographies like India and Latin America. So I think the important takeaway in the base case is that we are assuming, we're not necessarily assuming linear for everybody, we do have different assumptions in that base case, as to when those markets will see some type of recovery. So, internally, we are going through a very detailed bottom drop forecasting process that we put in place in mid-March. So each of the segment presidents and their respect to finance teams are presenting to me and Chris on a weekly basis, what those trends are. So, we have a good sense as to where things are going to ebb and flow. And I think you'll Chris already really kind of answered just like what are markets that we would expect to come back, sooner rather than later. So that's the base case and that's what we see today. I mean, we give you the day that through April the 24th as well in the U.S market. So, we tried to extend on that as far as we could and we're being optimistic that these trends are, will continue. However, we're not certain just like anybody else, what the implication of that is going to be. So that's why we thought it would be a prudent approach to provide the scenarios on that. So if you believe that the outlook that we're providing in our base case is not optimistic enough, that is why we've provided you with an upside case. We're not necessarily there at that point right now. And to be balanced, we put in a downside scenario as well to, just in the event that what we are experiencing right now. There is further deterioration or maybe there is second surge of cases, we just don't know and that's why we've taken approach that have. So, let me pass it back to Chris for some other comments on that. Well, I think we've given you our best thinking on this, and I feel pretty good that this is very comprehensive as to how we're thinking about it internally and we're literally sharing with you, what we're thinking right now. So, I mean, as I said, I think we'd be remiss to say our entire probability based on any of these scenarios. Again, that's why we get into the trends but we bid to serve as a foundation to anchor losses. Good question, and they sort of clarification on that. So, what the graphs are depicting and the volume decline is a comparison of April 24 of 2022, the prior year. So, it's not meant to be your summary of the trend or whatever it is. It's just the point in time where we were at the end of last week, and where volumes were on that. Hey, Andrew, good morning and thanks for the question. Yes, that's a good clarifying point to me too. So, we are when we extrapolate on trends forward, we are looking at the most recent data. We're not necessarily going back and looking at an average of the month of April as an example, but we are looking at maybe the most recent week and we're not as granular as saying, Oh, well, Friday was this, Friday the 24th is this. So, then that must mean every day is going to be like that going forward. There are some sensitivities on that we put into it. So, by and large what we're turning forward for May and June assumptions are taking the current volumes that we've been seeing over the last week. Okay. Seth, thanks for the question and happy to get into a little bit of the details. I guess what comes to mind when you asked that question about parallels to Hong Kong in the U.S., I guess first thing I think of is under very different businesses. So our business in Hong Kong is predominantly focused on financial services and we've branched out in some other verticals like direct to consumer. There's one example, but the U.S. it's more of a broad based portfolio as I'm sure you can appreciate. So, the other difference in Hong Kong is the way that the data is consumed. It's by and large purchased on a portfolio basis, so meaning in batches as opposed to just one off online credit reports on transactions. We do have that type of business in Hong Kong but predominantly the business that we have in Hong Kong is a lot more predictable because of the batch for that we do. So when we look at how that market has performed, because of that mix of business and the predictability of it, we didn't see such a steep downturn initially from it. But then conversely on the way back, I've seen big uptick as well too. And I think it's just the really important thing is just remember how different these markets are and how, how credit can be used in that. Well, obviously in the U.S, we're in the midst of it and I hope we've given you some good color, the trends that we're seeing and then answering the previous questions we have talked about what we feel like the recoveries are going to look like in various end markets. So Chris, I'll hand it back to you. George, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. So, again I think I'd refer you back to the slide that we pulled together to depict kind of our sentiments on the international business and where we think things are now going to where the impact is now and where they will return. In particular, I think I answered this as well, too, when we look at more developed type of countries like the UK and in Canada, they have shelter in place that's similar to the U.S. So, the impact is relatively about the same as if what we're seeing. I think it's more the emerging geographies, as I alluded to previously in India, and Latin America, where the lockdowns are a little bit more severe on that we've seen more of an impact in the short term on that. So, the reason that, if you go to the base case, you'll also notice that we are providing an outlook for each of our segments so for the U.S. markets for international and Consumer Interactive. And we typically don't do that as you know, and the reason that we did that was to just simply give you a perspective as to how we are thinking, each of the businesses are going to perform. So, specific to your question on international when we talked about it's being down mid as low 20s in the second quarter, we're taking into consideration all the points that I just made and the trends from that we have articulated on that on the slide for each major geographies. Yes. Hi, Andrew, if I understand your question, I think, you're looking for in the international portfolio where we would have countercyclical plays. I mean, is that right? Yes. I guess it's a general, general statement overall is that, I think, when we've talked to in the past about us having businesses that were countercyclical, we weren't necessarily contemplating a global pandemic, when we made those comments.

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. I want to welcome all of you to our call and extend our most sincere hope that you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. Nothing is more important. From the earliest days of the COVID pandemic, our primary focus has been the health and safety of our associates, our customers, and the wider communities in which we operate. In each of the markets we serve, we seamlessly moved to working from home, allowing us to protect our associates in the broader population while continuing to serve businesses and consumers. We appreciate the work of legislators and regulators around the world for taking decisive, significant actions to support consumers, businesses and the economies in these unprecedented times. We especially appreciate and respect the heroic efforts of healthcare professionals, first responders, and other essential workers on the frontlines combating COVID-19 and supporting their communities around the world. Let's begin this morning with an overview of how our first quarter unfolded. From January through the middle of March, TransUnion track well ahead of its prior volumes and meaningfully ahead of the revenue guidance provided in February. We saw strength in the financial services, insurance and public sector verticals in the U.S. as well as robust results in India, Canada and the UK. In mid-March, most of the countries in which we operate implemented shelter-in-place policies in order to slow the spread of coronavirus while absolutely necessary to protect public health. This approach caused a dramatic reduction in economic activity, curtailed consumer lending, and trigged job losses unprecedented in their speed and scale. The rapid increase in unemployment in the U.S. and many other markets has introduced uncertainty into consumer lending well beyond what was experienced in the great recession of 2008 and 2009. Many lenders have pivoted from client acquisition and overall growth strategies to risk management across their existing portfolios and assisting consumers through temporary forbearance arrangements. Despite the sea change in economic activity that began in the second half March, the strength of the first two and a half months of the first quarter resulted in revenue and adjusted EPS for TransUnion above the high-end of our guidance and adjusted EBITDA in the middle of the range. That said, the sharp downturn in transaction volumes experienced in mid-March has continued through April to-date and presents materially different business conditions across our portfolio than we expected in 2020. Given this, we're not able to maintain our previous financial guidance for 2020 or provide new full year guidance. Instead, we will focus today on the second quarter and the volume trends we are currently experiencing in key verticals and markets around the world as well as our approach for managing TransUnion through what we expect will be a prolonged and significant downturn before resuming TransUnion's previous trends for strong organic revenue growth, EBITDA growth and margin expansion. While the nature of this economic downturn is very different than what we experienced over 10 years ago and TransUnion is a very different company. I believe that, the continuity of our management with demonstrated crisis leadership in this industry will allow us to successfully navigate this challenging time. We intend to balance expense actions as required with ongoing investments in innovation and our technology operations and business portfolio. We are implementing across our markets globally a consistent playbook to help clients manage through this downturn. We also expect to maintain our program to accelerate our technology evolution, albeit at a pace calibrated due to current uncertain environment and our financial forecast. This investment is important to maintain our technological advantage and to support a return to the strong growth and relative outperformance we've enjoyed these last six years. Despite the near-term impacts of this COVID-19 driven economic crisis, TransUnion's business model and product and portfolio strength remain intact. I'll discuss the current volume trends across our primary verticals and markets and our quick transition to support the changed needs of our clients and consumers in this downturn. Although current market conditions present us from providing our usual financial guidance, the following slides illustrate the magnitude of the impact on our transaction volumes resulting shelter-in-place policies in the global economic reset. My commentary and any forward-looking statements must be cautious, measured and taken as directional, given the recency of the downturn and resulting uncertainty across our markets. Once I covered the current market dynamics, I'll hand over to Todd to discuss our detailed first quarter results, balance sheet strength and several financial scenarios for the second quarter, based on the trends I will describe. Let's first review the overall transaction volumes year-to-date for us financial services, our largest vertical market. As you can see, performance was strong relative to 2019 through the middle of March when shelter-in-place guidelines made their impact. We continue to penetrate the market with our broad and leading data solutions and lending volumes remained healthy. Since then, we suffered a considerable downturn against first quarter trends and prior year results. Over the two weeks prior to this call, volumes have stabilized, perhaps as lenders adjust for working from home and look to support their clients beyond implementing the initial round of forbearance arrangements. Now let's review the components of U.S. Financial Services in detail. Beginning with mortgage, refinancing activity was very strong throughout the first quarter on the strength of the low interest rates and further accelerated as the fed lowered rates in anticipation of a virus-led slowdown. While the surge has abated somewhat, refinancing demand exceeds lender's underwriting capacity, especially in this work-from-home environment and is above the last year as volumes. Strong demand for refinancing has kept mortgage rates slightly higher than they might otherwise be, and we expect these conditions to continue in the coming months. For monitoring the potential negative impact of increasing unemployment and payment deferral programs, which could lead to a smaller pool of consumers eligible for refinancing. And despite the overall growth of mortgage activity, new purchase mortgage activity has nearly halted due to quarantine provisions which prevent consumers from visiting properties for sale. We expect this trend to continue until the lockdowns are lifted and consumers are willing to socially interact. This could create pent up demand for home buying depending on broader economic conditions and create future upside opportunity. Similar to new mortgage activity, auto financing has fallen off as dealerships are closed in about half of the United States or only operating online and consumers postponed vehicle purchases. As this chart shows, in recent weeks, we've seen these trends improve as dealers have rapidly accelerated the move to online selling and lending-based initiatives. Vehicle lease expirations and general vehicle replacement needs also create continued minimum demand levels. Based on our experience in the great recession, we expect a recovering demand once consumers are able to return to dealerships and other normal activity resumed. Credit card lending also slowed considerably in March, but appears to have stabilized in recent weeks. The decline in card volume results from issuers reducing new client acquisition to focus on serving the needs of existing customers. Some clients are reducing originations until they better understand the evolving risk or converting acquisition programs to lower cost channels like digital in order to save money on direct mail costs. I would note that TransUnion supports all card marketing channels and approaches. Clients also are expanding their card portfolio reviews given increasing consumer risk and need. Portfolio reviews and event triggers using trended and alternative data are a critical part of risk and account management efforts, and we are increasing our focus on providing these services. Finally, consumer lending has also experienced a material decline in volume, including within the FinTech space. However, not all of the FinTech segments are reacting in the same manner. Many of the traditional FinTechs are focused on their direct customer acquisition channels while limiting partner channel volume. A few of seats most lending until the crisis improves, the retail point of sale FinTechs are experiencing a significant volume boom from increased online sales. Short-term lending volumes have declined substantially while lenders wait for more clarity regarding the U.S. employment situation. However, as we saw after operation chokepoint ended, they are generally able to quickly ramp up when ramp up volume when markets expand. Overall, we expect the financial services vertical to remain at lower volume levels until shelter-in-place orders are eased, allowing consumers to return to work and other normal activities. This could take several quarters. However, there are a few mitigating factors to highlight. First, mortgage refinancing should continue to be strong with most banks experiencing backlogs, as I mentioned previously. Second, we expect fraud mitigation solutions, like IDVision with iovation to perform well in this environment. We had experienced minimal impact to our fraud business thus far. They're having very constructive conversations with a wide range of lenders. As customers rapidly migrate homebound consumers to digital channels, lenders are concerned about in experiencing substantially increased incidences of fraud for login and verification. Our U.S. financial services is the largest in marketing for our products. The story is the same in many international markets, which I will discuss shortly. Third, we expect increased account management demand to continue as lenders look to more effectively service their existing customers. This will drive continued demand for more advanced solutions, including event triggers, printed data and alternative data. Finally, most of our contracts include volume minimums, and while they tend to be fairly low, there are valuable buffer. Contracts are also priced volumetrically, such as that as volume fall in the price per transaction rises, while this doesn't fully offset the lower volume, it does help. Now turning to our healthcare vertical, which helps healthcare providers navigate the revenue cycle to help improve the patient financial experience and maximize reimbursements for uncompensated care. The frontend of the cycle represents about one third of the revenue of the vertical and includes insurance eligibility checks, identity screens and payment estimation. As providers have shifted their focus to creating capacity in the healthcare system to prepare for the surge of COVID related patients, they canceled and delayed non-critical procedures. Although COVID cases will surge in hotspot areas, the overall impact on the healthcare system is a net decline in patient volumes. This started to impact the frontend business in late March, and we expect to see that decline persist through the second quarter. The other two thirds of this vertical is the back end of the revenue cycle, where we help providers identify opportunities to recover loss reimbursement through various revenue recovery products and services. Some examples include finding missing insurance information, resolving claim denials, and identifying Medicare bad debt dispersed reimbursement opportunities. By helping providers increase their revenue, reduce uncompensated care and avoid bad debt write offs, we provide a critical source of cash flow and in some cases provide essential products and services to assist providers in maintaining financial solvency. This is particularly important now, as the reduction in elective and preventative care is severely impacting providers' profitability. And while government stimulus programs are designed to help offset some of the impact, many providers are having to layoff and furlough staff. Writers may see additional pressure depending on how long the elective patient volumes are delay and how successful the reopening process is. Our current view is that consumer sentiment around comfort and safety are mixed at best reverting resuming normal healthcare elective treatments. Given the financial stress on healthcare providers, it's not surprising that the backend of our healthcare vertical has held up well thus far and provides providers and most providers, continue to be motivated and incented to continue their focus in this area to ensure they are optimizing their billing processes and recovering the greatest amount of reimbursement possible. The potential longer-term risk however, is that, there are fewer overall patients in the coming months in healthcare system, which could result in less overall opportunity for recovery of uncompensated care. In any scenario, our solutions continue to represent a valuable and essential part of the revenue cycle, helping providers reduce risk and increase their cash flow. Our insurance vertical serves property and casualty, life and commercial insurers with marketing and underwriting solutions as well as the analytics and investigative tools for claims. Thus far and in line with our expectations, insurance has seen a less severe impact than many other parts of our business. Unlike many other industries, insurances continue to provide services to their customers and to underwrite new business regardless of the broader economic conditions, particularly in auto insurance which is the largest part of our vertical. This connectivity level is driven by expiring policies, when consumers typically renew or shop for a new policy. In either case, customers use our data and solutions, only when the consumer chooses to let their policy lapse and not replace it does the industry see volume contraction. That is clearly a risk given the rising number of unemployed Americans and idle vehicles. However, we have seen many of the market leaders assisting their policyholders during this time through rebate programs. Core underwriting activity took an initial dip in mid-March, when shopping activity declined as consumers process the changes we've all experienced. However, in the recent weeks that trend has stabilized. Customer marketing programs thus far have continued as planned likely to help consumers understand the potential financial benefits of changing to a lower cost plan. In these economic conditions, consumers shop for lower rates to reduce their expenses. Furthermore, the desire to reduce costs and improve efficiency at our insurance customers is leading to increased interest in our drivers risk solutions. This solution helps to reduce the cost of motor vehicle reports, while providing more timely insights. Our team has stayed in close contact with our more than 300 insurance customers with heightened interaction with our top tier accounts. Our customer counterparts remain accessible and willing to engage in conversation about in-motion and new opportunities. We continue to leverage our market-leading capabilities to serve our insurance customers evolving needs. Turning our discussion of the U.S. market segment, I want to touch on a few other verticals, starting with collections. While we certainly see this vertical as counter-cyclical overtime, the initial negative impact has been quite severe for three reasons. First, many collections customers were not equipped to have their collectors work from home. This resulted in an immediate decline for several weeks, while collections firms developed capabilities to enable their workforce to work remotely. Second, in many states like New York and Nevada halted all collections activities for 30 day periods, and several other creditors have instructed agencies to suspend collection of their debt. And third, as part of the federal COVID legislation, certain consumers are being provided payment holidays. While we absolutely agree with and support the second two items as they provide relief to embattled consumers, these actions do create an air pocket in our business and push out resumption of normal collections activity by a few quarters. After that delinquent cases will be placed with collectors and activity should pick up over a three to six month period. In shifting to our public sector vertical which provides a variety of data driven solutions for federal state and local governments, at this point we have seen very modest impact. Government agencies continue to operate unabated and supportive of their constituents. Employees are largely able to work from home and are still engaged in ongoing business opportunities and open to new projects. We already provide fraud mitigation and identification solutions to certain agencies and we are in active discussions with them more broadly around the trillions of dollars in dispersals announced by the federal government. We're also talking to various agencies about heightened insider threat monitoring capabilities, as that risk increases when employees are homebound and might be facing financial hardships. Specific to combating COVID-19, we're also having productive conversations about providing federal agencies with right party contact information to support contact tracing. This is the process to identify and alert people who have been in close contact with an infected individual by contacting and monitoring those with a higher potential to become infected. Public health officials can reduce the spread of the virus by keeping them from infecting others. Having highly accurate right party contact data is critical for these efforts to be successful. Through TLOxp, we are well positioned to support these efforts. Conversely, we've seen a slowdown in some programs we support at the state level, but we've identified areas of potential upside where we can further support our customers and their COVID related mitigation work. As the preponderance of our underground COVID activity is taking place at the state level, our contacts are both distracted by these events and reluctant in some cases to proceed with certain activities like homestead tax act violations that may be viewed as of minor importance relative to the broader threat of COVID. We expect these activities to increase once the crisis has passed and states search for much needed revenue. At the same time, we do an opportunity to support COVID relief efforts with our background screening solutions. It is critically important that volunteers across all fields are properly vetted before engaging in these activities, as we've seen in previous large crises like Hurricane Katrina. Tenant screening is an area where we've seen a sharp slowdown as consumers are not actively seeking to move, often resigning with their current landlord instead of taking the risk of moving into a new location. Similarly, with a sharp reversal in employment trends, we're seeing employment screening slows substantially. We expect both of these areas to present opportunities as economic conditions improve and both moving and hiring increase. Finally, in telecom, we've also seen meaningful slowdown is more than 80% of cellular retail locations are closed, resulting in far fewer new plan and device sales along with the attendant credit checks that we provide. We expect this trend persists, so it may rebound very quickly as there's likely pent up consumer demand that will need to be satisfied when the lockdowns are lifted. Now turning to Consumer Interactive, consumers continue to recognize the value of credit and identity protection, credit monitoring, and related financial education tools, like those that we offer both directly and indirectly through partners. Even as consumers were facing economic uncertainty and hardship. They're still demonstrating interest in the tools and resources that help them manage their credit health and drive informed decisions. As a result, today, we've seen only a modest negative impact to our direct subscriber base. We continue to tune our marketing efforts to maximize acquisition and retention of high quality subscribers. On the other hand, some of our indirect partners have curtailed their marketing programs, likely resulting in decline in subscribers, which is the basis of our revenue model. Positively, we've had a number of substantive discussions with potential new partners that have expressed interest in building more robust consumer facing offerings, like financial education and modeling tools for their clients who may be facing difficult personal financial situations. Across our international markets, we have seen a pronounced slowdown, as lockdowns have been implemented in varying degrees of severity in all of our geographies. We're pleased to see that across all of our major markets, though, governments and lenders are providing relief for distressed consumers, as well as certain types of businesses. Our international teams have mobilized a swift response by providing customers with actionable insights that highlight differentiated solutions that we didn't have during the 2008 and 2009 crisis. These include credit vision trending data, credit view, market leading portfolio management insights, and fraud solutions. This approach has position our business at the forefront of enabling our clients to shift from originations to portfolio and risk management. In broad terms, we've seen developed markets like Canada, the UK and Hong Kong behave more likely the U.S. with meaningful declines across each country or regions portfolio. In the UK, lending markets are under similar stress as in the US, and that has and will weigh on our results. On a positive note, we've seen strong performance in several parts of our diversified portfolio. Fraud solutions, which are about one third of our UK business, are up significantly as consumers are accessing online services from government agencies that require authentication and identification. This trend will likely continue into the second quarter that will eventually taper off as all eligible consumers gain access to these sites. Our differentiated affordability suite is proving to be attractive to customers monitoring income shock, as unemployment has soared in the UK. Also in the UK, we recently won several critical government projects that focus on the health and financial welfare of UK consumers and businesses during the COVID crisis. In Canada thus far, it's looked more like the U.S. with a weak underlying lending market that we expect to continue while lockdowns remain in place. However, our first quarter results benefited from a number of breach remediation contracts that are not based on transactional inquiry volumes and thus are largely unaffected by COVID. This benefit will also continue into the second quarter. We also benefit from portfolio diversification that includes fraud solutions, direct-to-consumer offerings and insurance and government verticals. In particular, we see the heightened interest in our direct-to-consumer solutions as our customers seek to strengthen their relationships with their customers. In emerging markets, the impact has been worse as consumers rely more on branch and other in-person channels. Across almost all of these markets, we see a pronounced lack of digitization along with more aggressive government lockdown restrictions. In these geographies, more aggressive tactics have resulted in a greater impact on our business. In India, we have a fairly diversified portfolio that includes credit reports and scores, but also analytic and decisioning tools, fraud solutions, direct-to-consumer offerings and commercial credit business. Our broader portfolio provides a buffer to the dramatic declines we've seen in lending inquiry volumes. The stark drop in activity is a result of the challenges Indian consumers have in transacting online and the severity of their lockdown restrictions. In LatAm, we serve a variety of markets, and in general we've seen consumers challenged to transact remotely, while lockdowns have largely not been as strict as in some of our other markets. Notably in Brazil, we do not operate a credit bureau but rather a data analytics business that largely serves the insurance industry and that provides a modest buffer against the declining lending activity there. The South African economy was challenged prior to COVID and is now projected to be down low to mid single digits. Lockdown actions are less severe than countries like India and the Philippines. Our business in South Africa is diverse and has a large component that serves the insurance industry. In Hong Kong where we saw the impact of COVID the earliest, has stabilized at lower revenue run rate. We're encouraged to see that leveling off as the economy is slowly reopened. Our business has benefited from an increased focus on portfolio and risk management tools, fraud mitigation solutions and should be further aided overtime by the resumption of our direct-to-consumer channel in early April. Rounding out APAC, the Philippine is facing significant headwinds, much like India with a very aggressive lockdown program that has shuttered much of the economy. As we contemplate a recovery, we expect developed markets to have a faster rebound as these governments tend to have more capability and capacity to implement stimulus to drive economic growth. In light of the current situation, our new reality is that many of our markets are likely to face extended periods of lockdown or other social distancing. I will walk you through our new downturn playbook that proactively addresses the issues our customers face through a three phased approach. This is grounded in our understanding of these markets and our experience from past crises. Phase 1 is focused on understanding and serving our customers needs in the midst of the COVID crisis through our close partnership and engagement. We've increased our customer engagements to accurately identify and segment needs that drive tangible, easy-to-implement packages to support them. Given the immediacy of the needs, the packages use mostly existing capabilities assembled to directly address the current circumstances. Examples of this include advanced portfolio management that leverages our newest data assets, drivers first solutions that reduce costs and offer broader data to insurers, e-commerce fraud mitigation tools using both iovation and IDVision and income and spending reviews in some of our global markets. In the spirit along with others in the industry, we've advocated for a continuation of clear and effective reporting of data so that customers and consumers remain confident in the data and are able to make well informed decisions in the future. We've also come together as an industry to uniformly increase consumers access to their credit reports at no charge from once per year to once per week during COVID crisis. Phase 2 of this program is focused on helping customers emerged from the COVID crisis, even as the timing will vary between markets and industries. In this phase, we will build new products to address specific industry and geographic needs. Some examples may include new models that incorporate post-COVID trended and alternative data attributes, integrated fraud and digital marketing solutions, and new underwriting frameworks. In both phases, we'll leverage our latest tools to support customers. For example, we can leverage our unique innovation lab to help customers work through their own specific projects using our data and our industry experts. In fact, we've already conducted virtual innovation labs with excellent customer feedback. In the past those occurred at our headquarters. These activities will all be coordinated on a global level so that we best leverage new practices and approaches throughout the Company. In Phase 3, we will address whatever new normal emerges from this crisis and we will ensure that our long-term planning reflects the new challenges and opportunities. While we believe that our long-term strategy is more relevant than ever, we will revisit it based on what we learn from Phases 1 and 2 of this downturn playbook. Our comprehensive approach addresses both the near term reality that we and our customers face while keeping TransUnion well positioned for future success. The next element of our downturn playbook involves managing our cost structure to adapt to both changing macro landscape and the impact it's having on our business. Like most companies, our traveling and entertainment expenses will drop substantially as we shelter-in-place. We're also maintaining our head count, freezing hiring with the exception of certain key strategic programs until we have better visibility into the shape and speed of the likely recovery. We've addressed some other discretionary costs by canceling internal meetings and prioritizing our capital spending. We have some additional opportunities to address costs and Todd will talk to you about these in a moment. We have quickly imprudently taken appropriate cost actions that are helping mitigate the impact on our margin even as revenues expected to decline sharply in the second quarter. Just to start down term playbook addresses our cost structure, we've also prioritized our investments to focus on innovation, operational efficiencies, and our celebrated technology investment, which we renamed project rise and we discussed in great detail during our last earnings call. We will continue to invest appropriately under the circumstances to support our customers as they deal with unprecedented market challenges while also taking steps to bolster our long-term growth prospects. The takeaway from these comments is that we are proactively working with customers and consumers to help them manage through the current environment while we manage our costs and prioritize our investments. This gives us confidence that we will successfully navigate the current situation, and the Company will be well positioned when markets rebound. Our strategy and portfolio positioning remain intact, allowing us to continue to deliver industry leading long-term top and bottom line growth. More specifically, we will still benefit from being innovators with attractive market positions across geographies and strategic verticals. We will still leverage our enterprise growth playbook to engage with clients to offer value added solutions. We will still possess the same powerful and proprietary and third-party data assets and we will still operate, and industry leading technology platform that is only going to get stronger through project rise. TransUnion culture will remain the same, focused on customers with individual accountability and performance, and we will continue to practice sound financial management and be good stewards of shareholder capital. That point marks a good transition for me to turn the call over to Todd, who will talk more about our strong balance sheet and cash flow position, our first quarter performance and our scenario based view of the second quarter. Over to you, Todd. Okay. Thanks, Todd. So to conclude this morning, we've laid out a comprehensive, transparent and realistic view of our business and of the markets that we serve. We've outlined our plans to proactively address the situation with our cost structure and in the investments that we're making for the near and long-term. While we clearly will face some short-term challenges, our portfolio and strategy remain intact and will be as powerful and differentiated after the COVID pandemic as they were before. Most importantly, we're going to continue to prioritize the health and wellbeing of all of our associates and of the broader communities in which we operate in globally. And with that, I'll turn it back to Aaron. Thank you. This is Chris, Manav. Good morning. I'll handle that question first but just a quick caveat. You know, obviously Todd and I and Erin are doing this from home, so if there's any pause or awkwardness in the handling of the questions, it's just due to that fact. As I mentioned, we're going to continue to invest in the strategically critical initiatives that we had talked about in the last earnings call and in various investor relations communications we've done. Over the last quarter of last year, the acceleration of our tech investments, our evolution, if you will, is foremost among those. It is part an acceleration of the migration of certain apps to the cloud. But as I also mentioned, it was the implementation of streamline technology architecture, across our core product portfolio as well as just a reduction of some of the sprawl that has accumulated through the years and around the world. As our revenues decline starting in mid-March, we looked at the expense base, we prioritized our capital spending, and we maintained a good level of spend in this area because we feel like we can execute very effectively in a work from home environment. And of course it's important for our medium-term and long-term success. It'll do a lot for positive development agility. It'll also reduce our cost structure. So in this base case that we've outlined in our operating to expect us to continue to invest in this program, we may not do it as aggressively, at least in the initial month or so until we get more confidence around the level of revenues that we're going to have. And of course, if we saw a material worsening in the environment, we would have to look at this area and other areas like personnel overall to determine how to appropriately size those investments. But we want to maintain the program, we think it's important and we also continue to invest in new innovation, I can think of half a dozen major product categories that have good plans being executed to strengthen our positions. And again, I think we can execute effectively in these areas, in this work from home environment. In fact, I have to say overall, our workforce has adapted very quickly to working from home. I am really comfortable in the level of service that we're delivering our clients and folks are engaged and productive. Okay, fair enough. Let me start at an overall level, we've had a lot of detail around our transactional volume performance, particularly in the U.S. markets. I believe that in the international markets, which are largely in countries with emerging economies, those countries went into deep shelter in place policies, probably a week or two weeks after the U.S. and so the downturn there has been a bit more pronounced. And I think that will probably be another couple of weeks or so before and again, I hope we see the type of stabilization and even recovery that we're seeing in the U.S. There are also some challenges and some of those markets where there's not the same degree of internet connectivity or digital penetration in general in consumer lending and originations and all of that, so it could be a little bit curtailed until a lockout ease and physical movement is again possible. But I do know really across all the countries in our portfolio, we see adaptations to the current circumstances, which I think bode well for volumes in the future. In terms of particular categories that would rebound and I think auto lending will rebound because folks will be able to visit dealers, even if they have to implement social distancing approaches. But right now, that's been a considerable lockdown, new home purchases could benefit as well. I think consumer lending, which has endured I think the most pronounced impact of the different lending subcategories. Once those lenders get a sense of the performance of their own portfolio and in the current employment situation, and the impact that they stimulus from the federal government is having, that's a category that could also bounce back. I think collections activity in the coming quarters could increase substantially. I like the way we're positioned in that space from a product and a capabilities perspective, but as I mentioned in my comments. collectors weren't geared up to work from home and there's a collection hiatus in place, but I do think that in the coming quarters lenders will have to collect on delinquencies and you'll see quite a resurgence in those activities. I'm going to pass it over to Todd, but who I think can take us through the detail in our thinking and you are looking for some kind of probability I think of A, B or C. So with that, let me pass it over to Todd. Yes, I just realized from Todd's comment there that I forgot to answer part of an earlier question, which is our perspective on the nature of a recovery, there's talk of V shape, L shape, U shape et cetera. I think we feel like it's going to look something like a Nike swoosh, where the descent was pretty rapid and then there'll be a slow and measured rate of improvement over time, but with some ups and downs along that trend line. And that's because, this is an economic crisis that's brought about by health crisis. And we're still having to manage within the constraints of our ability, to deal with the health crisis, and it's not as if we're all going to be able to just resume our normal social and economic behavior that had produced the growth that we were enjoying. It's going to take some time, it's going to have to be measured, and we're going to have to really get some disease transmission and treatment and all under control before we can get back to the way things were. Okay, so we'll tag team on this question. But just to clarify our language, just because we say stabilization doesn't mean flat lined, necessarily, it probably just means more. It's not declining and it's either flat improving. If you look at the trend over the past 10 plus business days, we see flat to improving in all of those financial services markets, which is encouraging and we're looking at our volume trends every day from markets around the world. And so much of the earlier question while we're not getting probabilities, we do feel good about our base case and that is what we are managing towards currently, but we are prepared to pivot prepared to pivot and manage each of the cases that we outlined. As for the April question, let me hand it to Todd Yes. I think so. I mean, look, one of the, we've talked a lot about trended data through the years and on these calls, and we've succeeded in pushing it to many of the markets in which we operate around the world. And we think it's going to be especially helpful for understanding the risk of existing portfolios, and even, new client acquisition in this more limited environment. One of the data attributes, that's going to be especially helpful for lenders is, what we call aggregate excess payments. And overtime what we can see is, the amount of debt service in excess of the minimum required that consumers are making, and I think that speaks to several factors, that speaks to revenue or income and expenses getting to some type of a consumer free cash flow measure, if you will. And then it speaks to their behavior, their propensity to service, their data take care of it, which is more of a behavioral characteristic, and I think lenders will look at that when doing their portfolio reviews. We're also coming up with new attributes that we've already rolled out that are helping with more current signal. So, we're looking at how consumer trade lines are being reported in this environment, and we're able to characterize of those that has forbearance or other hardship relationships and disaster recovery codes, and that's an incremental current signal that all will go and help toward the risk assessment of the current portfolio. On top of that, there's some signal in our alternative data sets where prior mainstream consumers are now dipping into the payday loan market, that could be an indication that. And also any negative demand deposit activity. We're fortunate in that we're able to see bounce checks in any other negative activity on demand deposit accounts nationwide in the U.S. In some of our other markets, we actually get current income information from the major banks and we have pioneered that product in the UK, it's part of a debt leverage ratio that we have put out in the market for many years now that helped banks determine which consumers will likely need some assistance in meeting their obligations. Yes, sure. I think I'll back clean up on this one because you know, before he was the CFO of all TransUnion, Todd was CFO of International, and he had great detail on these markets. So, Todd why don't you fill them on the Hong Kong experience. Yes, just two quick comments. I mean, I guess in summary, the difference in the product mix that we have or the weighting of the product mix in Hong Kong lends itself to stability. And you know that business has held up pretty well over the past year or 18 months. I mean, initially we had the protests and political instability, which caused some curtailment. And then we had the unfortunate fraud situation in our direct to consumer business, which took that offline and then of course the pandemic. All that said though, it's still a strong business and it's also just giving us insight as to how this pandemic and also the recovery may develop. Our employees have been going back to the office in Hong Kong, but in a measured and limited way and we've got the A teams and the B teams and we've extended the work day, we stagger some shifts. We only have one team in the office per day and we try to limit it to those that really need to be in the office. We've got a direct to consumer window that we have to manage. They're in Hong Kong. So, it's a little bit unique and frankly employees we're ready to get out and about and that's what I would expect is going to happen here in the U.S. We're just doing, we're just a few weeks or more behind that. Yes. I'll start with this and without putting specific numbers on it, we're seeing the direct part of our business hold up pretty well. Consumers value the service and they are keenly focused on their financial management, right now, and that's encouraging and we're maintaining our marketing spend, our marketing returns are very acceptable, and we're going to continue to grow that segment of the business. On the indirect side, it's a little bit tougher sledding, if you will. Most of the revenue comes from lead aggregation business models. And because Financial Services right now is paused a little bit in terms of new client acquisition or the volume of activity is greatly diminished, our revenues from that segment have been more challenged than the direct side. But overall, the direct to consumer segment is performing quite nicely and we're encouraged by it."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope that all of you remain safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion investor relations website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses, and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, and the comments made during this conference call, and in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. With that out of the way, let me now turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and best wishes that you and your families are healthy and doing well in the year. To start, I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll highlight our ongoing commitment to critical sustainability issues. And then, I will review our strong fourth quarter performance, and the underlying market trends that position us for continued attractive growth in 2022. I'll also provide an update on the very positive performance of our Sontiq and Neustar acquisitions of late last year, as well as details on the exciting deal for Verisk Financial Services division, which we announced this morning. And then, I'll cover our progress in executing on our global technology platform initiative. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first -- our fourth quarter results in detail, along with the first quarter and full-year guidance for 2022. So across TransUnion in 2021, it was a productive year as we focused on delivering to our customers while also making bold and impactful strategic moves. Across the Company, we adjusted to a new normal as the pandemic persisted and we felt the effects of the Omicron surge. Despite this challenge, TU associates have remained completely engaged and connected across the enterprise. I want to thank them for their perseverance and commitment. Now during the year, we also continued to make important progress around diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as on our environmental impact. Our DE&I journey. We continued to strengthen our company culture, evolving intentionally so all our associates feel informed and empowered to succeed. Our Racial Equity Task Force and CEO Action for Ratio Equity Fellow advanced equity interest in Company policies and our recruiting, hiring, and development protocols. Our associates engaged in learning and dialogue on inclusion and understanding and we supported numerous racial justice organizations in innovative ways. We also strengthened our commitment to financial inclusion, with an explicit emphasis in our corporate strategy and goals. And we recently earned a perfect score from human rights campaign foundations, 2022, Corporate Equality Index, a leading national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertaining to LGBTQ employees. I'm proud that our inclusive and welcoming culture has been recognized by such a prestigious organization. We've driven all this change and yet our journey is not complete. We continue to push to reach our gender [Indiscernible] goals globally, and our representation goals, and to foster even greater equity and inclusion from our associates. Finally, on our environmental stewardship, we publicly announce our commitment to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions related to leased facilities by 2030. You can read about these topics and many others in detail in our next sustainability and diversity report which we expect to publish this spring. So let me start with the fourth quarter. We posted very strong results with broad-based growth across our businesses as our regions in end-user markets benefited from continued positive momentum, as well as new wins and successful innovation. We continue to drive above-market performance by executing our growth playbook that focuses on repeatable differentiated go-to-market approaches, industry-leading innovation, and complementary expansion into adjacent markets. In U.S. markets, we delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth with strong performance in financial services, insurance, media, and tenant and employment screening. Internationally, we saw very strong results in India and Latin America where we hold leadership positions in markets with strong growth trends. Todd will provide more details about the performance of our businesses shortly. Now, I want to spend a minute on the market backdrop that has fueled 2021 results and sets the stage for our strong growth in 2022 in organic revenue guidance. On an organic basis, we expect to grow 5.5% to 7.5% in total. Those growth rates increase to 9% to 11% excluding the declining mortgage segment. Although mortgage -- although the mortgage market began to decline last year from its record levels, most of our other markets have bounced back strongly from the depth of the COVID crisis in 2020. Overall, our markets have proven resilient and continued their return to more typical levels. And while the surge in COVID infections temporarily inhibited a full recovery, our markets and our customers have become effective at operating under pandemic conditions, enabled in part by the ongoing digital transformation. In most markets, we saw, and continue to see, robust consumer spending. In the U.S., consumer balance sheets have strengthened during the pandemic due to government benefits, repayment moratoriums, and restricted consumer mobility. Internationally, we see similar trends, along with meaningful pent-up consumer demand. Our markets also benefit from renewed marketing activity, as clients resume their efforts to grow their businesses. We've seen historically strong customer acquisition programs from consumer lenders and credit card issuers in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. And we expect this broad strength to continue into 2022. Also, and importantly, consumers remain well-positioned to fully re-engage economically. In recent earnings commentary, some of the largest U.S. financial institutions have referenced the health of U.S. consumers and forecast robust lending growth in 2022. Now as we consider our long-term growth prospects, we believe that the increase in digitalization of economic activity provides opportunities to serve customer needs in marketing and fraud mitigation. This premise motivated our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq and our investments in Monevo and IDfy. Most recently, we've invested in India -based online PSB loans, an online lending platform that enables borrowers, primarily, micro, small, and medium enterprises, and individuals, to apply for loans online and receive in-principle approval in under one hour. These strategic moves, in particular Neustar and Sontiq, bolster our portfolio of solutions to improve identity verification and targeting precision to enable safe, tailored online consumer experiences. Now, I'd like to discuss our intent to acquire Verisk financial services division from Verisk. This is a well-known collection of assets which can enhance our positions in financial services, analytics, fraud, and marketing. The division generated $143 million in revenue in 2021 and 65% of which came from Argus, the primary business in the portfolio with which we've enjoyed a long-standing strategic partnership. Argus provides unique and authoritative data on credit and debit card spending behavior, as well as for demand deposit accounts or DDAs. This data complements our credit card vertical and analytics capabilities, generally. In the U.S., Argus covers 90% of all credit cards and 45% of all DDAs through contributions from a broad consortium of banks and card issuers. It also has coverage of large portions of card activity in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Argus offers solutions to help these consortium members increase financial inclusion, acquire new accounts, make risk decisions, mitigate fraud, and deliver relevant consumer experiences by leveraging their unique data and the associated behavioral insights. Argus is a powerful data asset that fits with TransUnion's expansive set of alternative data and serves our core financial services customers. We will also take the necessary time to fully understand each of the businesses within this portfolio and their potential fit with existing TransUnion assets. With that said, we see a clear path to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our customers, resulting in improved revenue growth and margin performance, which I'll detail in a minute. We intend to pursue four primary growth opportunities that will benefit Consortium members. First, we will better utilize the full wallet view of the consumer that Argos currently offers, by leveraging the analytics derived from the Argos data and combining that with our robust market insights. The full wallet view provides insight into consumer behavior from an initial transaction or deposit through card usage and loan payment. This is critical for financial services customers to make better risk fraud and marketing decisions. Second, we will modernize the delivery of Argus ' data and insights by leveraging our technology capability. Currently, customers receive static reports from Argus that don't allow them to visualize, augment, model or manage the data. We plan to deliver a highly interactive product using the Prama platform which is already used by many lenders as the visualization and analytics tool. Third, we see the opportunity to expand Argus ' data coverage in addressable market. We can leverage our relationships with banks in the U.S., to grow the deposit database well beyond the current 45% penetration, and increase benchmarking value for Consortium participants. And although Argus data is anonymized, we believe we can derive valuable signal to identify lending fraud, to make superior risk decisions into better target consumers for Consortium participants. These behavioral insights will improve the predictive power of solutions such as our credit vision and credit vision link products, which in turn will create more value and stickiness for those solutions with our banking customers. Now let me wrap up with the deal terms in a discussion of the financial impact of executing these growth strategies. The purchase price for the division is $515 million, which is a 12.5x adjusted EBITDA, an attractive price for such a unique data asset. We expect the transaction to close in the 2nd quarter of this year. Now, as I noted, the business had revenue of $143 million in FY '21. and while revenues have declined in recent years, we believe that TransUnion brings the financial market focus, the data and analytic capabilities, the sales resources and a host of complementary assets to reverse this decline and resume growth. And as we integrate Argus in 2022, we anticipate growth in the low-single-digits. In 2023, we expect growth to improve to the high single-digits and then reach the low double-digit range by 2024. In 2021, the business delivered roughly $41 million of adjusted EBITDA, or about a 29% margin. Now, for those of you who follow Verisk, you'll notice that the adjusted EBITDA figure is higher than in Verisk previous public disclosures. This is because Verisk allocates certain corporate costs to the financial services division that TransUnion will not require. Therefore, the portfolio will generate more profit than previously disclosed. And even as we increase investment in these businesses, we'll improve the margin over the next four years through revenue growth and cost savings actions. We expect to achieve 40% margins by 2026, further reducing our acquisition multiple. And finally, as we're able to fund this transaction with cash, it will be immediately accretive in 2022 after we close. Data assets of the quality of Argus are rare, and so we're pleased to add it to our portfolio and to strengthen our core business for the long run. Now let me turn to our Sontiq acquisition, which leverages a cloud-based technology infrastructure to provide solutions to help consumers and businesses protect against identity theft and cybercrime, including identity monitoring, restoration, and breach response solutions. The acquisition creates an entry point into the fast-growing ID protection market, that has been driven by rapid digitization and the evolution of online commerce. In this environment, consumers have a heightened awareness and concern over the risks of identity theft. Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market, fueling long-term growth. Sontiq also helps us transition from a credit education and monitoring provider, to a fuller provider of sophisticated identity protection, augmenting both our direct and indirect consumer businesses. It provides us access to new attractive end markets, like employee benefits, while expanding our position in current markets such as insurance. And Sontiq provides incremental capabilities including dark web monitoring, transaction and child monitoring, and proprietary capabilities for breach risk assessment. Now, we closed this acquisition on December 1st and our team has begun a smooth integration. We have transitioned key Sontiq employees into senior leadership positions to ensure the continuity in retention of their valuable market and product knowledge. This has also allowed us to quickly bring together both sales and product development teams. We believe this influx of talent and innovation capabilities will accelerate the long-term revenue growth of our consumer interactive business. And finally, on a pro forma basis in 2021, Sontiq revenue was approximately $87 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2020 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%, but it would've been about 40% absent one-time deal-related expenses. In going forward, we expect the business to grow low double-digits at an approximately 40% margin in 2022 on the strength of the underlying digital protection market, and the benefits of the combination with TransUnion solutions. Now, turning to Neustar, this acquisition substantially strengthens our identity resolution capabilities for a variety of online applications. Neustar provides real time identity resolution through its state-of-the-art oneID platform, powering solutions that currently serve three attractive markets: marketing, fraud mitigation, and communications. As we bring these capabilities together within TransUnion, we bolster our already strong identity resolution capabilities with accurate in the Fortinet PII, generating incremental scale and scope in those three complementary markets that Neustar serves. As we expand in these high-growth non-credit markets, we further diversify our portfolio, which contributes to our ability to consistently outperform our underlying markets. We closed the acquisition on December 1st, and began the integration immediately, while also giving the Neustar team space to conclude a very strong year, which they did. For 2021, the pro forma organic revenue was $585 million, which is up 8%, and with double-digit growth in the marketing business. This coincides with about 40% organic growth for TU 's marketing solutions in 2021. Now, Neustar adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, which is better than our expectations. In 2022, we expect the business to deliver another year of high single-digit on organic revenue growth driven by strong performance in marketing and fraud. Approximately 90% of the Neustar business is based on previous year bookings, which lends further confidence to our growth expectations. And along with the strong results, we have pulled forward some cost synergies. We're now -- we now anticipate generating roughly $160 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2022, which would produce a 25% margin. Now, all of these financial metrics have come in stronger than our initial expectations when we announced the transaction in September. And it reinforces our confidence that the business can deliver low double-digit revenue growth beginning in 2023 and that margins can progress, adjusted EBITDA margins, to approximately 40% by 2026. In the short time we've owned the business, we found Neustar employees to be very engaged and enthusiastic about joining TransUnion. They too can see the opportunities created by the combination. We've also identified roles for the senior executives from Neustar bringing clarity to both organizations and ensuring consistency as we go forward. Notably, we created a new functional area with NTU, a global data and analytics that will be headed by Venkat Achanta, the former Chief Data and Chief Technology Officer of Neustar. Now, Venkat was the principal executive driving the development of Neustar's oneID platform, and this new organization will bring further focus to the data and analytics growth enabling TransUnion. And finally, Neustar's CEO Charles E. Gottdiener, joined our Board in January. Charlie has decade-long experience in leading information services and technology companies driving innovation and scaling operations. And together with his experience at Neustar, this makes him a tremendous addition to our board. Now, all of that presents a good segue to an update on our -- the development of our global technology platform or Project Rise. Project Rise is a cloud based global engineering effort that makes TransUnion 's technology more efficient, scalable, secure, and effective, by streamlining processes and increasing automation. Our ongoing investment enables us to further streamline our application ecosystem and transition to a more modern API based and services oriented software architecture. As part of this investment, we've assessed and rationalized our applications globally to reduce sprawl with a plan to ultimately shift over 50% of these applications to the public cloud. We recently received approval to operate a credit bureau in Brazil and have deployed, on our AWS technology, a new cloud-based credit bureau platform to establish our position in that attractive market. Now this platform will enable us to deploy existing and enhanced bureau services including real-time streaming data ingestion and delivery in a flexible, scalable infrastructure. Additionally, we are layering policy as code, which is built into the provisioning of our AWS capacity, so as it comes online, it is fully loaded with the necessary compliance, model governance and security, as well as our operational and development standards. And we're delivering these benefits through our continuous improvement in deployment pipeline. Today, 90% of our applications that are targeted for migration to the cloud are utilizing these infrastructure and policy code pipeline. These shifts allow us to reduce our data-center footprint by as much as 60%, creating tremendous efficiencies. Now, all of this work is being completed largely by our internal talent and our expertise including the almost 1500 associates globally that are now certified in cloud technologies. Building this internal capability will benefit us in the long run, as we are creating a cloud native workforce, with an efficient way to build IP in a sustained manner, which brings us to Neustar. Neustar has been on a similar path with Google Cloud for a consistent architecture, security and governance, and improved operational efficiency. With the acquisition, we have a unique opportunity to enhance and to complement our technology by leveraging Neustar's oneID platform and their established Cloud confidence to support all of our non-credit based solutions. This will result in a scalable, in a secure, in an effective environment, while being a Cloud provider agnostic with an upskill technology workforce. Given the expanded vision and the integration activities of the multiple acquisitions, along with the divestiture of our Healthcare business, we're extending the timeline for this technology work through 2024. And to support our aspirations to become a best-in-class technology organization, we're increasing our planned investment to $215 million to $240 million versus the original range of $150 million to $175 million. Now since the start of our technology transformation, we have realized savings that we anticipated, and we've opportunistically reinvested them in technology, in solutions and expanded operations. As we continue to deliver on our technology transformation and to generate future savings, we'll either continue to reinvest them or we'll let them fall through to the bottom line. Now with that, let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our fourth quarter financial results in detail and our first quarter and full-year FY '22 guidance. Over to you, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone as well. As Chris pointed out, a lot happened in the fourth quarter, most notably completing the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq while divesting our Healthcare business. In order to make clear the impact of the sale of Healthcare, we have recast results for TransUnion U.S. markets as well as emerging verticals for the past three years along with quarterly recasting for 2021. They are available as exhibits to the 8-K we filed this morning and can be downloaded as an Excel file from the investor relations section of our website. We believe this will allow you to properly assess our ongoing business. In that vein, I want to start by bridging our fourth quarter 2021 results off the rebased fourth quarter 2020, which is laid out in detail on this slide. For the sake of simplicity, from this point on, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the fourth quarter or full year of 2020, unless noted otherwise. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 21% on a reported and constant currency basis. Neustar and Sontiq added about nine points to revenue, which means that organic constant currency growth was 12% and above our rebased guidance range. Excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 16% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and constant currency basis, and within our rebased guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, down 210 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by the lower margins of Neustar. Excluding both the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, the margin would have been 37.5%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth, offset by higher interest expense. Again, we delivered within our rebased guidance. Let me now take you through our full-year performance. Full year 2021 consolidated revenue increased 17% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Four acquisitions; Neustar, Sontiq, Tru Optik, and Signal contributed three points of revenue growth resulting in organic constant currency growth of 13% which was above our rebased guidance range. Excluding mortgage, which was 11.5% of our total revenue in 2021 from both the full year 2020 and 2021, our business grew 15% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, placing us within our rebased guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.1% up 140 basis points compared with the year ago, driven primarily by the strong revenue performance. Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29%, also within our rebased guidance range. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense, debt prepayments, and lower labor. Now looking at the segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter. The Neustar acquisition had about 13 points of impact on revenue growth. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 19%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 18% on an as-reported and 12% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 205 basis points, largely because of the acquisition of Neustar. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that at this time, we have included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial services revenue grew 12% and was up 27%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending remains strong and press FinTechs, short-term and point-of-sale lenders, particularly throughout the seasonally strong holiday period. We expect this market to continue its strong performance in 2022 as participants continued rebuilding their books buoyed by significant inflows of investor capital along with a steady stream of new entrants. We also had another strong quarter in our credit card business as issuers pursued incremental share of wallet. Even with the strength we saw in 2021, we see significant runway for further growth in 2022 as issuers remain keenly focused on customer acquisition. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well-publicized inventory issues for new and used cars. Nonetheless, consumer demand remains high and as such, we would expect a nice rebound when inventory issues are resolved though there is no certainty in the market about when that might happen. And for mortgage, we remain at historically very high levels of activity but saw declines throughout most of the year including the fourth quarter. As interest rates have crept up, the available refinance pool has slowly been depleted and new home prices remain high while inventory remains low. Looking ahead to 2022 for the full year, assuming a continuation of these trends and expectations of further increases in interest rates, we expect our mortgage revenues to decline roughly 19%. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals which grew 44% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. We saw double-digit growth in most of our major verticals. Public sector delivered another strong quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. We were also named one of three companies able to participate in a significant Department of Labor Blanket Purchase Agreement, presenting another avenue for incremental growth in the years to come. And that employment screening remains strong, particularly in tenant screening, where we have continued to win new business with large multi-family property management firms. As we look into 2022, we expect another good year driven by the roll out of recent wins across our customers, property portfolios. And our media vertical continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as we sign new accounts and expanded existing relationships with a large media agency and several very large media companies focused on video and streaming platforms. The true audience marketplace which was built from the Tru Optik acquisition, has delivered substantial growth, which is expected to continue into 2022. Insurance also delivered double-digit growth on the strength of new business wins in 2020 and 2021, along with another year of significant growth in our new product portfolio, including the most significant traction we've ever seen in insurance for digital marketing, and the strength of the true audience platform. Consumer interactive, which includes Sontiq, revenue increased 14% on a reported basis, and 8% organically. Adjusted EBITDA was up 14%. We grew in both the direct and indirect channels again this quarter, with particular strength in indirect, driven by some one-time breach related revenue. Chris already discussed the meaningful strategic impact of the Sontiq acquisition, which we expect to help drive strong consistent revenue growth in the future. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. Well, the total segment revenue grew 15% as we saw underlying market improvement in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 20% as a result of the strong revenue growth. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 12%. We continue to benefit from a meaningful one-time government contract. Excluding that revenue, our UK business would have grown about 4% in the quarter. Our growth was negatively impacted by the significant Omicron surge in December along with the soft mortgage and auto lending market as the UK faced some of the same pressures I described for the U.S. Positively, though, we are seeing similar strength in unsecured lending and card issuance to what we're seeing here. Our Canadian business grew 5% in the 4th quarter. As we saw growth across our portfolio, partially offset by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year-ago quarter that I've mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the non-recurring breach business, revenue would have grown 7%. We continue to see strength across our portfolio with good balance between traditional financial services and emerging fintech customers, particularly in the BNPL space, and we expect those trends to persist into 2022. In India, we grew 35%, reflecting strong market trends despite a surge in Omicron infections. Government authorities have not imposed any restrictions related to Omicron so consumer trends have held up remarkably well. Our above-market growth was driven by the increasingly broad nature of our portfolio that builds on our very strong consumer credit foundation. For instance, our commercial credit business had another very good year and now represents about 20% of our revenue in India. Similarly, we saw a continued strong growth in our relatively new direct to consumer offerings. As we look ahead to 2022, we expect continued strength against a healthy macro backdrop with GDP projected to be almost 8% supported by significant pent-up consumer demand. In Latin America, revenue was up 17% with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This strong growth reflects ongoing strength in financial services and particularly with FinTechs and Neobanks, and continued strong uptake of credit vision and fraud solutions. But also continue to see good performance in our government and insurance verticals in a number of countries. In Asia Pacific, we grew 6% driven by positive momentum with our relaunched direct consumer offering in Hong Kong and business wins with lending customers there. The Philippines returned to growth and we are cautiously optimistic that the country will start to emerge from COVID-related challenges. And finally, Africa increased 13% on the continued strength of our auto and retail businesses as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market, South Africa. In 2022, we expected business to deliver another good year driven by new business wins, our leading innovation, and additional growth outside of South Africa. As this chart shows, we both increased debt during the fourth quarter to fund the Neustar and Sontiq acquisition and then paid down a portion of it. Once we received the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare business, we immediately paid off the entire $640 million second lien loan associated with the purchase of Sontiq. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Almost $350 million of that amount is earmarked for taxes associated with the sale of healthcare. Then we prepaid another $400 million of debt in January. We also reserved cash to cover the $515 million purchase price of Verisk Financial Services which will be funded with cash on hand. Adding Verisk Financial Services to the equation, we expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.5 times by the end of 2022 driven by the expected growth in our adjusted EBITDA. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year. All the guidance provided reflects the divestiture of Healthcare from the prior results and our outlook. And to be clear, Verisk Financial Services is not included in current guidance. I would also note that differently from previous initial annual and first quarter guides, we have attempted to capture more of the potential upside in our outlook, resulting in the particularly strong figures I'll walk you through. Starting with first-quarter, we expect minimal impact from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And for revenue, we anticipate a 24-point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq. Revenue is expected to come in between $906 and $914 million dollars, or a 30% to 31% increase on an as-reported basis, and 6% to 7% on an organic constant currency basis Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate 5-point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 11% to 12%, excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $330 and $337 million, an increase of 19% to 21%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 330 to 290 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar's lower margin. On an organic basis, excluding the two acquisitions, margins are expected to increase approximately 10 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.91 and $0.94, an increase of 10% to 13%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of headwind to revenue from FX. And we also expect about 22 points of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.752 billion to $3.81 billion, up 27% to 29%. Our guidance includes 3.5 points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue, excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis is expected to increase 9% to 11%. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to be up mid-single digits, but up low teens, excluding mortgage. Financial services are also expected to be up mid-single digits, but mid-teens excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low double-digit. We anticipate that international will grow low double-digits in constant currency terms. And we expect consumer interactive to decline low-single digits on an organic basis as a result of challenging comparisons in the direct channel, which has slowed in recent months. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.386 billion and $1.424 billion, up 20% to 23%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 210 basis points to 170 basis points this year, driven by the lower margins of Neustar and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq. However, we expect the margin to expand about 40 basis points on an organic basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year is expected to be between $3.84 and $4, up 12% to 16%. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be similar to 2021s adjusted tax rate of 22.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $515 million. And the portion excluding the step-up amortization from our 2012 changing control and subsequent acquisitions thereafter should be about $215 million. We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $205 million. And finally, capital expenditures should come in at about 8% of revenue. I will now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. And to conclude, TU delivered another strong quarter and full year while also making strategic acquisitions and investments that will better position us for long-term differentiated growth. We expect to have another very good year in 2022, driven by continuation of strong market conditions and executing our growth playbook. And looking ahead, we will hold our first Investor Day in three years on March 15th. At the event, we'll introduce our next-generation strategic framework and provide an updated multi-year financial outlook. I'll be joined by a dozen TransUnion leaders who'll cover a broad range of important topics including our vertical and geographic markets, global solutions, operations, technology and talent and diversity and inclusion strategies. We're excited to share the next chapter in our story, particularly on the heels of our recent transformative M&A. And with that, let me turn it back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. Thanks, Chris. And that concludes our prepared remarks today. For the Q&A, as always, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants and now we'll be glad to take those questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may now go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Want to ask about marketing. If I heard you correctly, I think you said marketing revenue at TransUnion organically was up like 40%. Can you just break it down for us if that was the case and just how much is this in financial services, to what extent is the entrant into media really adding? I think there was a call-out on insurance, digital marketing, and then would just love any update on current thinking on Neustar revenue synergy potential to stick with that strong growth that you're seeing at TU.\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Good morning, Jeff. This is Chris, and thanks for the question. We talked about marketing revenues in the marketing business. First, these are revenues that are derived outside credit business. These are [Indiscernible] diversification, investments, and acquisitions that we've made both at TU but also that we anchored with the large Neustar acquisition last year. So the assets independent of Neustar at TU grew about roughly 40% and we have expectations for continued strong growth going into FY \u201822. Now, as Todd mentioned, the Neustar business in total, through 9%, 8% of that was organic, but the marketing component within Neustar was low double-digits. So as you think about 2022, as we have combined organizationally, our marketing, vertical leadership, and product development and our sellers and we start to combine our datasets and capabilities, you're talking about a marketing business that is positioned to grow low double-digits at least. So we're really excited about what we're seeing. And frankly, we feel with Neustar and with our marketing business, we're running well ahead of schedule. I think the other thing that I would point out is that, the profitability of the business is scaling rapidly as we expected when we made the acquisition and we conveyed to the market. Our profitability from Neustar for this year, the expectation is about $160 million, which was above our initial expectations of roughly $145, $150 - ish. I'll pause there and see if Todd wants to add anything.\nTodd Cello: The only thing I would add is to remind everyone that the Neustar acquisition on [Indiscernible] solidly accretive to TransUnion's EPS in 2022. And I think that's just important to remind everybody because, initially, when we announced [Indiscernible] in September of last year, we talked about the transactions being slightly dilutive potentially. So the significant performance that the business had through the end of FY '21 carried into FY '22, gave us the confidence to raise the revenue number meaningfully without very high flow-through to adjusted EBITDA as well as to adjusted diluted EPS. So we are expecting a very strong year from Neustar in 2022.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. You may now go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi there. A lot is going on with this year. So adding Argus, the TransUnion will have really two major transformations going on in FY '22, both Neustar and Argus. How are you going to stay focused on both and do you have to meaningfully change the Argus product road map to achieve the growth targets that you're looking for Argus in FY '23 and FY '24? And could we also get mortgage revenue as a percentage of total for FY '21?\nChris Cartwright: Sure, Andrew, we can do all of that. And obviously, there's a lot going on within TransUnion as we execute on transformative strategy and really expand our product capabilities in terms of whether we can handle it? I would ask you to look at our results from the core business for both the third quarter and this fourth quarter, where on a comparable basis, we continue to perform at the high-end of the market. The core is very strong. I'd also ask for you to look at the performance of the Neustar acquisition and the Sontiq acquisition in the early days. These are; the growth full assets, the growth rates accelerating, and the profitability of scaling. We feel like we are ahead of all of our expectations and we're really comfortable with the way things are going. Now, when you get to the Argus portfolio, I think it's important to remember that 65% of the a $143 million comes from the Argus asset itself. And that asset is entirely complementary with TransUnion's focus on financial services, which remains a high proportion of our revenues globally. And in fact, in our specialized market approach, we have a dedicated credit card marketing vertical. It's one of the largest single verticals within TransUnion. And this gives us a very special asset and analytic capability that is unique amongst the bureaus. As the market is long noted, the Argus data asset is highly differentiated and many in sell-side have speculated that it was an asset better owned by one of the bureaus. We believe that's the case that we bring the appropriate market focus, not only in the U.S. but across all the geographies that we operate in. Additionally, you have to remember that one of our largest product investments in recent years has been in the Prama platform. The Prama platform is designed to deliver data to clients and analytic capabilities that allows them to visualize and interact and model with the data in a very powerful way but also a very user-friendly way. The Argus product, I think given the lack of scale or potentially fit, has not evolved similar capability. It is still largely a PDF or paper-based delivery of benchmarking in analytic services and then a subsequent iteration with the consortium clients. We're going to be able to migrate the data and the deliberate to the Prama platform in relatively short order, and create a step change in value add for Consortium members. On top of that, because we live in this space, we think we're going to be able to create new products based on the existing dataset that will add more value to the Consortium, that we'll be able to grow coverage on the demand deposit side given our expansive relationships with the banking sector, and that there is even potential to extend, if not, to reinforce the Argus franchise in various other markets that we have strong positions such as the UK but just can't [Indiscernible] I realized there's a lot going on but you should think of this acquisition of the Financial Services Division, one; of giving us a unique asset in greater scale in analytics, beefing up our analytics product capabilities but also giving us a unique asset to support our card marketing, our card business. And also the remainder of the assets have nice overlap. We're a big player in fraud. They have nice fraud mitigation assets. Obviously, we're doing well with our marketing investments. They've got some marketing assets that complement. So we think we are a very good owner of this asset and that it's a fit with our various market positions and our growth plans.\nAndrew Steinerman: Well said, and mortgage?\nTodd Cello: Yeah, mortgage is 11.5% of 2021 revenues.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. You may now go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Argus as well, and maybe just a broader question [Indiscernible]. So first thing I -- again, there's a lot of acquisitions in there to be integrated; two of them seem like to me to almost turn them around. Just talk to us a little bit about the bandwidth that you guys have to manage this all at once. And just -- just a quick follow-up on Argus. You've obviously under-performed for like 5 + years now. So just wondering if [Indiscernible] gave you comfort that you guys can fix it.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Manav, I think we got the majority of your question. Your voice is a little faint there. But let me start with the acquisition of workloads. I mean, obviously that was a very important consideration before we went forward. And we thought about it and came to the conclusion that we're well-positioned to take on this incremental work in part because different parts of the organization are engaged in different aspects of integrating our various acquisitions. So Sontiq, it's primarily a direct-to-consumer play and Neustar is the integration and the growth is being led by the combination of our marketing product folks and our fraud folks, and then we're adding this complementary communications protocol. And then on top of that, Neustar and Sontiq have very capable technology organizations. And in the case of Neustar, it's an upscale, mature business that functions well, that had just reached a growth and an efficiently inflection point. And I think you can see that in that -- our profits are scaling from roughly $115 million in FY '21 to an expected $160 million in FY '22. Now, Argus will be driven primarily by the hard sub-vertical within financial services overall. Argus operated largely separate from Verisk, and has an independent technology organization that's really going to benefit from an influx of financial services, data and analytics know-how. I just spoke extensively to Andrew 's question about the capabilities that Prama brings a modernize the delivery of that technology. Now, Argus, as you said, has been lower growth in recent years and there's been a combination of factors. I mean, one, I think we bring the focus as I've said. Two, the delivery of the service has needed to be digitized for some time. And again, I'll point you to Prama. We've spent a considerable amount developing this facility -- have a substantial pool of recurring revenue that's going to anchor that technology and it gives us -- or continued use case innovation for growing the data and for delivering additional kind of analytics tools within its overall sandbox that will add a lot of value for consortium members. And then also look, as we looked at the asset, we realized that in recent years, in particular this past year, the pandemic has had the most profound impact on the portfolio, in the early phases of the pandemic card marketers, more or less aggressive, they pulled back and that in part reduced their need for the discretionary analyses that they would undertake with Argus. Also a big contributor to the overall decline is the LCI bankruptcy data business. We're a consumer of bankruptcy data. And as you may know, Manav, the level of bankruptcies in the U.S. is off by over 50% these past two years. And that's because of all the government intervention and the repayment for bearances across the economy. While we're exiting that period, and as bankruptcies returned to a normal level, you're going to see an appreciation in some of these related assets. And again, in our diligence, and particularly with a focus on Argus, we could see in the second half the pipeline building, sales increasing, and we feel like we're coming into FY '22 with some momentum.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari. You may now go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. You've touched on a lot of detail around the top line as it relates to these acquisitions but you also mentioned increased tech spend through 2024. Maybe if you could touch on what your free cash flow conversion looks like post-integrating all of these deals. Does that look a lot better than what you had pre -business transformation, if you will? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Hey, Hamzah, this is Todd. Let me take that question. From a free cash flow perspective, historically TransUnion has run in the high teens, and I would describe that, but so we're aligned on the definition as adjusted EBITDA less capex. We've been in that range. I think the expectation for us on in the longer term is to be solidly in the same spot. The tech transformation is going to -- it's going to provide significant benefits for us. When we talked -- when we initially launched Project Rise back in February of 2020 and we told the market about it, we talked about the savings that Rise would generate. And the savings actually came quicker. And we were able to start to redeploy some of those dollars last year into valuable investments to support our products, as well as our security infrastructure. That's how I would think about the tax part of this. The other part of it is the M&A itself. And if you think about Neustar, Sontiq, and now Verisk Financial Services, Neustar and Verisk Financial Services are coming into TransUnion with a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than what TransUnion has. But you've heard that our plans are to significantly scale those businesses to bring the margin more in line to the margin that you appreciate as a holder of TransUnion's shares, so meaning in that 40% range. That's our objective, is to scale Neustar and Verisk Financial Services to those levels and we've been consistent in that messaging. So taking the combination of the investments that we're making in TransUnion along with the acquisitions we've made in our intentions to fully integrate and then also scale on the businesses, The net result is an attractive, free cash flow margin. Now is that going to happen this year? Probably not, because there's going to be investments in this year, probably next. But longer-term, you'll be back to levels that you've come to appreciate from TransUnion.\nChris Cartwright: And if I can weigh in just a little bit here, I just want to point out that we at the initial guide, if you will, for the profitability of these acquisitions. And so our confidence is higher and the execution is going well. And as for the increase in the overall cost to complete the development of our global engineering platform in the Cloud, it's really proportional to the increased size of our business. The M&A has given us considerably more revenues. We're on pace to be a little bit under $4 billion this year. But again, round numbers not guide, don't get excited. but we're substantially larger organization. But there's also more technology that we want to harmonize, that we want to share a common foundation and a common set of engineering services and security approaches, if you will, and so we increased the budget to achieve that. You have to point out that Neustar is a very strong technology organization, that they've been operating in the Cloud for over six years now, and that in fact, their experience in Cloud operations and the foundation that they have built is really informing and accelerating some of the work that we're doing around here. And in the end, I think the combination of, or rather having a mature tech foundation in both the Amazon Cloud and the Google Cloud is a good kind of competitive position with these key vendors. And so we like this multi-cloud approach that we're able to evolve to given Neustar's capabilities.\nHamzah Mazari: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead?\nToni Kaplan: Thank you. You reported another strong quarter of non-mortgage financial services growth at 27%. Just hoping if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of competitive landscape because it seems like you're taking share, so I just want to understand where you think your best position now relative to competition. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yeah, it's a good question, Toni, and I appreciate it. And again, the core business is performing extremely well. And the growth rates are top of market. And I think it's really, look, we're leveraging the momentum that we've built since the LBO forward. And our growth is based on really deep understanding and insights of customer needs. It's why we invest so much in our vertical market capabilities. For example, we don't just have a financial services vertical. We have a mortgage vertical, and we have a card vertical, on auto lending vertical, a consumer vertical, etc., because these are all different flavors of lending that have meaningfully different needs, and we've got people who come from those industries who connect well at the sea level there, that market through thought leadership. And then we backed it up with innovative and increasingly broad suite of interrelated products. And if you think of that strategy, you can see how the Argus data asset fits nicely into that because an important part of our value add is managing the data and creating the tools in the platform to yield important analyses that help our clients make better decisions and take more effective actions. What we're seeing is a robust market. We think things are looking good in terms of an expansion of lending volume in FY '22. Now, of course, the mortgage bubble is unwinding. We saw a deceleration in the fourth quarter, and we're forecasting further contraction. But despite that, we're able to post some pretty attractive organic growth. And again, when you think about the FY '22 guide and you pull out mortgage, the remainder of the business is we're guiding at 9% to 11% organic, which is pretty tremendous on top of comps that we've posted in the third and fourth quarter of FY '21, which again are at the top of market. So my overall messaging is, look, the core is proving as strong and performant as it ever has. And the acquisitions that we made, albeit there were some initial concerns, they're performing well in excess of the expectations we set on multiple financial metrics. We think we're successfully broadening the number of things we can do for our clients and we're executing quite well in the early days.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. You may now go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask maybe another follow-up on the Verisk Financial Services deal. I think you mentioned an opportunity to increase penetration with demand deposit accounts. I was just hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Help us understand why there is such a large penetration opportunity there, going from 45% to potentially higher and maybe what the implications might be to getting more DDA data, whether it be increased financial inclusion, whether it's helpful for employment or income verification opportunities, any additional color there would be great. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes. So the consortium of lenders that contribute the card transaction in information on a depersonalized basis. The 18 member strong consortium gives us over 90% coverage of card transactions in the U.S. And then we've got majority market coverage in Canada, the U.K., and Australia. And of course with TransUnion, we feel we've got the ability to take this model to other countries where it doesn't exist because we are focused on the financial services sector in all the countries in which we operate. Now in the U.S., the Consortium also decided to contribute demand deposits information. Demand deposit accounts are less concentrated than credit cards accounts, so the current coverage is about 45%. And that data is used to do a variety of performance benchmarking between the Consortium members that inform their management practices. Well, TransUnion covers the entirety of the financial services market in the U.S. And we think that there is appetite for that type of benchmarking and other analytics that we can provide some that data as you go down market, and that having broader coverage would enrich the value of the assets overall. So we believe that we can leverage our selling and our business relationships generally to increase their contributions of demand deposit activity. Now, as to your question about verified income or other insights, I want to be clear that this asset is not used for those purposes currently, it is an analytic tool and it's a benchmarking tool. That said, it is -- both the card data and the DDA data are extremely unique in valuable data assets that can fuel, I think, a generation of innovation at TransU, right? But that's where our focus is today. And again, look, I understand that there's a lot going on here. That's by design. This is a period where we can really increase our product coverage and lay a foundation of data and capabilities for another generation of growth. But we feel like this is a great asset for us, for all the reasons we've mentioned. We feel like the acquisition price is fair and attractive in that -- it's 12.5 times EBITDA for a differentiated data asset, and that include -- and that's exclusive of the revenue in the cost synergies that we have -- we believe that we have because of our intense focus on financial services.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. You may now go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You expect revenue growth from Verisk Financial Services business to accelerate from low-single-digits in 2022 to high-single-digits in 2023, and low double-digits by 2024? As you know, this business has declined in recent years. You talked about modernizing data visualization in the product that go to market. Can you elaborate a bit on how much of the growth improvement you're expecting from price realization, from new logo growth, and from cross-sell and up-sell into existing customers as you implement these various initiatives?\nChris Cartwright: Yeah, I can in general terms, George, so what I'll say is look, we -- we've been part -- we know this asset very well because we've been partnered with them for over a decade. And we watched performance of the asset, and we understand why its performance has been distressed in recent years, particularly in this past year where it was in the full grips of the pandemic. Now, this was a focal point for us in our due diligence. So as we completed our commercial due diligence, we talked to a wide range of customers and they all said that the Argus data asset is extremely valuable. That they fully intended to continue to utilize it, go forward. And that they even expected to increase the discretionary analytics they'd previously asked for now that they've entered into a more customer-acquisition oriented period, one of robust growth. Part of this acquisition is a bet that we are acquiring the asset at the end of a market bottom, if you will. Now, the other feedback we received from clients was that they really wanted to improve the technology delivery capabilities. And again, Argus recently released an early version of a new and improved platform that provides some of the functionalities declines that we envision providing. But of course, we have Prama. And again, Prama has been -- we've been investing in it for four or five years now, tens of millions dollars and it is a state-of-the-art cloud-based data visualization, data analysis and delivery platform that is ideally suited for the type of data and studies that markets have. So this is another reason why we are good owner. And we're also bringing a large, dedicated sales force to this product. Verisk, did not have such a sales force. We do in our sale people, buttressed by the thought leadership our verticals provide, are really good at helping clients get additional value from these type of analytics. So it's another reason why we think we can grow the assets. And again, we can expand the data coverage, particularly in demand deposits, we can expand geographically, and we can innovate and develop new use cases for our clients that we can monetize. Maybe it will be some price there as we prove ourselves as the worthy owner, delivering some increased value-add to the Consortium. But again, I think if you look at the entry multiple and also the fact that we've got considerable revenue -- considerable synergies, both revenue and expense, this is a good opportunity for us and it will be immediately accretive and we think will create a lot of shareholder value from this deal. And listen, we came away after the commercial diligence even more positive about the assets than we were previously, and in the early hours here, post announcement, we're getting great feedback from a multitude of Consortium members to really get the industrial logic of this asset in the hands of a bureau like TransUnion.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen. You may now go ahead.\nGeorge Mihalos: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I wanted to circle back a little bit to the increased tech spend, the $65 million or so increase from the original numbers for Project Rise. And first question, just a point of clarification, I want to make sure those will be excluded from the adjusted EBITDA calculation, going forward? And then secondly, I think you had said by 2023 you were targeting $20 million to $30 million of cost benefit; are you able to sort of update those number for what they'll look like, I guess, kind of closer to 2025 when you're fully up and running from the tech transformation? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Hi George, this is Todd. Thanks a lot for the question. So yeah, let me hit off the first one as far as the Project Rise costs are concerned. Yes, we will continue to exclude our tech transformation from adjusted EBITDA. So that's been our practice since 2020. So we'll continue to do that. As it pertains to the commitment that we made a couple of years ago on cost saves of $20 million to $30 million for Project Rise, as I said earlier on one of the responses, we actually did start to secure savings a lot earlier than we had anticipated in particular, in 2021. And as consistent with what we said back in February 2020 when we launched Project Rise, we said we would take the opportunity to either let that flow back down to the bottom line or should we invest back into the business. So the meaningful savings that we had in 2021, we redeployed back into the business to support our organic product initiatives, as well as our information, security posture. And so that's where the priority has been.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And that, that brings us to the end of our time as we're coming up to the top of the hour, give everybody a little bit of time. We need some transition to some other calls. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking with people soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone as well. As Chris pointed out, a lot happened in the fourth quarter, most notably completing the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq while divesting our Healthcare business. In order to make clear the impact of the sale of Healthcare, we have recast results for TransUnion U.S. markets as well as emerging verticals for the past three years along with quarterly recasting for 2021. They are available as exhibits to the 8-K we filed this morning and can be downloaded as an Excel file from the investor relations section of our website. We believe this will allow you to properly assess our ongoing business. In that vein, I want to start by bridging our fourth quarter 2021 results off the rebased fourth quarter 2020, which is laid out in detail on this slide. For the sake of simplicity, from this point on, all of the comparisons I discuss today will be against the fourth quarter or full year of 2020, unless noted otherwise. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 21% on a reported and constant currency basis. Neustar and Sontiq added about nine points to revenue, which means that organic constant currency growth was 12% and above our rebased guidance range. Excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 16% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and constant currency basis, and within our rebased guidance. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.8%, down 210 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter, driven primarily by the lower margins of Neustar. Excluding both the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, the margin would have been 37.5%. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13%, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth, offset by higher interest expense. Again, we delivered within our rebased guidance. Let me now take you through our full-year performance. Full year 2021 consolidated revenue increased 17% on a reported basis and 16% in constant currency. Four acquisitions; Neustar, Sontiq, Tru Optik, and Signal contributed three points of revenue growth resulting in organic constant currency growth of 13% which was above our rebased guidance range. Excluding mortgage, which was 11.5% of our total revenue in 2021 from both the full year 2020 and 2021, our business grew 15% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 21% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, placing us within our rebased guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39.1% up 140 basis points compared with the year ago, driven primarily by the strong revenue performance. Full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 29%, also within our rebased guidance range. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense, debt prepayments, and lower labor. Now looking at the segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 25% compared to the year-ago quarter. The Neustar acquisition had about 13 points of impact on revenue growth. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 19%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 18% on an as-reported and 12% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 205 basis points, largely because of the acquisition of Neustar. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that at this time, we have included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial services revenue grew 12% and was up 27%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending remains strong and press FinTechs, short-term and point-of-sale lenders, particularly throughout the seasonally strong holiday period. We expect this market to continue its strong performance in 2022 as participants continued rebuilding their books buoyed by significant inflows of investor capital along with a steady stream of new entrants. We also had another strong quarter in our credit card business as issuers pursued incremental share of wallet. Even with the strength we saw in 2021, we see significant runway for further growth in 2022 as issuers remain keenly focused on customer acquisition. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well-publicized inventory issues for new and used cars. Nonetheless, consumer demand remains high and as such, we would expect a nice rebound when inventory issues are resolved though there is no certainty in the market about when that might happen. And for mortgage, we remain at historically very high levels of activity but saw declines throughout most of the year including the fourth quarter. As interest rates have crept up, the available refinance pool has slowly been depleted and new home prices remain high while inventory remains low. Looking ahead to 2022 for the full year, assuming a continuation of these trends and expectations of further increases in interest rates, we expect our mortgage revenues to decline roughly 19%. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals which grew 44% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. We saw double-digit growth in most of our major verticals. Public sector delivered another strong quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. We were also named one of three companies able to participate in a significant Department of Labor Blanket Purchase Agreement, presenting another avenue for incremental growth in the years to come. And that employment screening remains strong, particularly in tenant screening, where we have continued to win new business with large multi-family property management firms. As we look into 2022, we expect another good year driven by the roll out of recent wins across our customers, property portfolios. And our media vertical continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as we sign new accounts and expanded existing relationships with a large media agency and several very large media companies focused on video and streaming platforms. The true audience marketplace which was built from the Tru Optik acquisition, has delivered substantial growth, which is expected to continue into 2022. Insurance also delivered double-digit growth on the strength of new business wins in 2020 and 2021, along with another year of significant growth in our new product portfolio, including the most significant traction we've ever seen in insurance for digital marketing, and the strength of the true audience platform. Consumer interactive, which includes Sontiq, revenue increased 14% on a reported basis, and 8% organically. Adjusted EBITDA was up 14%. We grew in both the direct and indirect channels again this quarter, with particular strength in indirect, driven by some one-time breach related revenue. Chris already discussed the meaningful strategic impact of the Sontiq acquisition, which we expect to help drive strong consistent revenue growth in the future. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. Well, the total segment revenue grew 15% as we saw underlying market improvement in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 20% as a result of the strong revenue growth. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 12%. We continue to benefit from a meaningful one-time government contract. Excluding that revenue, our UK business would have grown about 4% in the quarter. Our growth was negatively impacted by the significant Omicron surge in December along with the soft mortgage and auto lending market as the UK faced some of the same pressures I described for the U.S. Positively, though, we are seeing similar strength in unsecured lending and card issuance to what we're seeing here. Our Canadian business grew 5% in the 4th quarter. As we saw growth across our portfolio, partially offset by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year-ago quarter that I've mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the non-recurring breach business, revenue would have grown 7%. We continue to see strength across our portfolio with good balance between traditional financial services and emerging fintech customers, particularly in the BNPL space, and we expect those trends to persist into 2022. In India, we grew 35%, reflecting strong market trends despite a surge in Omicron infections. Government authorities have not imposed any restrictions related to Omicron so consumer trends have held up remarkably well. Our above-market growth was driven by the increasingly broad nature of our portfolio that builds on our very strong consumer credit foundation. For instance, our commercial credit business had another very good year and now represents about 20% of our revenue in India. Similarly, we saw a continued strong growth in our relatively new direct to consumer offerings. As we look ahead to 2022, we expect continued strength against a healthy macro backdrop with GDP projected to be almost 8% supported by significant pent-up consumer demand. In Latin America, revenue was up 17% with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This strong growth reflects ongoing strength in financial services and particularly with FinTechs and Neobanks, and continued strong uptake of credit vision and fraud solutions. But also continue to see good performance in our government and insurance verticals in a number of countries. In Asia Pacific, we grew 6% driven by positive momentum with our relaunched direct consumer offering in Hong Kong and business wins with lending customers there. The Philippines returned to growth and we are cautiously optimistic that the country will start to emerge from COVID-related challenges. And finally, Africa increased 13% on the continued strength of our auto and retail businesses as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market, South Africa. In 2022, we expected business to deliver another good year driven by new business wins, our leading innovation, and additional growth outside of South Africa. As this chart shows, we both increased debt during the fourth quarter to fund the Neustar and Sontiq acquisition and then paid down a portion of it. Once we received the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare business, we immediately paid off the entire $640 million second lien loan associated with the purchase of Sontiq. We ended the year with $1.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Almost $350 million of that amount is earmarked for taxes associated with the sale of healthcare. Then we prepaid another $400 million of debt in January. We also reserved cash to cover the $515 million purchase price of Verisk Financial Services which will be funded with cash on hand. Adding Verisk Financial Services to the equation, we expect our pro forma leverage to be approximately 3.5 times by the end of 2022 driven by the expected growth in our adjusted EBITDA. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter and the full year. All the guidance provided reflects the divestiture of Healthcare from the prior results and our outlook. And to be clear, Verisk Financial Services is not included in current guidance. I would also note that differently from previous initial annual and first quarter guides, we have attempted to capture more of the potential upside in our outlook, resulting in the particularly strong figures I'll walk you through. Starting with first-quarter, we expect minimal impact from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And for revenue, we anticipate a 24-point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq. Revenue is expected to come in between $906 and $914 million dollars, or a 30% to 31% increase on an as-reported basis, and 6% to 7% on an organic constant currency basis Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate 5-point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 11% to 12%, excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $330 and $337 million, an increase of 19% to 21%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 330 to 290 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar's lower margin. On an organic basis, excluding the two acquisitions, margins are expected to increase approximately 10 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.91 and $0.94, an increase of 10% to 13%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of headwind to revenue from FX. And we also expect about 22 points of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.752 billion to $3.81 billion, up 27% to 29%. Our guidance includes 3.5 points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue, excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis is expected to increase 9% to 11%. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to be up mid-single digits, but up low teens, excluding mortgage. Financial services are also expected to be up mid-single digits, but mid-teens excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low double-digit. We anticipate that international will grow low double-digits in constant currency terms. And we expect consumer interactive to decline low-single digits on an organic basis as a result of challenging comparisons in the direct channel, which has slowed in recent months. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.386 billion and $1.424 billion, up 20% to 23%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 210 basis points to 170 basis points this year, driven by the lower margins of Neustar and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq. However, we expect the margin to expand about 40 basis points on an organic basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year is expected to be between $3.84 and $4, up 12% to 16%. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be similar to 2021s adjusted tax rate of 22.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $515 million. And the portion excluding the step-up amortization from our 2012 changing control and subsequent acquisitions thereafter should be about $215 million. We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $205 million. And finally, capital expenditures should come in at about 8% of revenue. I will now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. The only thing I would add is to remind everyone that the Neustar acquisition on [Indiscernible] solidly accretive to TransUnion's EPS in 2022. And I think that's just important to remind everybody because, initially, when we announced [Indiscernible] in September of last year, we talked about the transactions being slightly dilutive potentially. So the significant performance that the business had through the end of FY '21 carried into FY '22, gave us the confidence to raise the revenue number meaningfully without very high flow-through to adjusted EBITDA as well as to adjusted diluted EPS. So we are expecting a very strong year from Neustar in 2022. Yeah, mortgage is 11.5% of 2021 revenues. Hey, Hamzah, this is Todd. Let me take that question. From a free cash flow perspective, historically TransUnion has run in the high teens, and I would describe that, but so we're aligned on the definition as adjusted EBITDA less capex. We've been in that range. I think the expectation for us on in the longer term is to be solidly in the same spot. The tech transformation is going to -- it's going to provide significant benefits for us. When we talked -- when we initially launched Project Rise back in February of 2020 and we told the market about it, we talked about the savings that Rise would generate. And the savings actually came quicker. And we were able to start to redeploy some of those dollars last year into valuable investments to support our products, as well as our security infrastructure. That's how I would think about the tax part of this. The other part of it is the M&A itself. And if you think about Neustar, Sontiq, and now Verisk Financial Services, Neustar and Verisk Financial Services are coming into TransUnion with a lower adjusted EBITDA margin than what TransUnion has. But you've heard that our plans are to significantly scale those businesses to bring the margin more in line to the margin that you appreciate as a holder of TransUnion's shares, so meaning in that 40% range. That's our objective, is to scale Neustar and Verisk Financial Services to those levels and we've been consistent in that messaging. So taking the combination of the investments that we're making in TransUnion along with the acquisitions we've made in our intentions to fully integrate and then also scale on the businesses, The net result is an attractive, free cash flow margin. Now is that going to happen this year? Probably not, because there's going to be investments in this year, probably next. But longer-term, you'll be back to levels that you've come to appreciate from TransUnion. Hi George, this is Todd. Thanks a lot for the question. So yeah, let me hit off the first one as far as the Project Rise costs are concerned. Yes, we will continue to exclude our tech transformation from adjusted EBITDA. So that's been our practice since 2020. So we'll continue to do that. As it pertains to the commitment that we made a couple of years ago on cost saves of $20 million to $30 million for Project Rise, as I said earlier on one of the responses, we actually did start to secure savings a lot earlier than we had anticipated in particular, in 2021. And as consistent with what we said back in February 2020 when we launched Project Rise, we said we would take the opportunity to either let that flow back down to the bottom line or should we invest back into the business. So the meaningful savings that we had in 2021, we redeployed back into the business to support our organic product initiatives, as well as our information, security posture. And so that's where the priority has been."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and best wishes that you and your families are healthy and doing well in the year. To start, I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll highlight our ongoing commitment to critical sustainability issues. And then, I will review our strong fourth quarter performance, and the underlying market trends that position us for continued attractive growth in 2022. I'll also provide an update on the very positive performance of our Sontiq and Neustar acquisitions of late last year, as well as details on the exciting deal for Verisk Financial Services division, which we announced this morning. And then, I'll cover our progress in executing on our global technology platform initiative. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first -- our fourth quarter results in detail, along with the first quarter and full-year guidance for 2022. So across TransUnion in 2021, it was a productive year as we focused on delivering to our customers while also making bold and impactful strategic moves. Across the Company, we adjusted to a new normal as the pandemic persisted and we felt the effects of the Omicron surge. Despite this challenge, TU associates have remained completely engaged and connected across the enterprise. I want to thank them for their perseverance and commitment. Now during the year, we also continued to make important progress around diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as on our environmental impact. Our DE&I journey. We continued to strengthen our company culture, evolving intentionally so all our associates feel informed and empowered to succeed. Our Racial Equity Task Force and CEO Action for Ratio Equity Fellow advanced equity interest in Company policies and our recruiting, hiring, and development protocols. Our associates engaged in learning and dialogue on inclusion and understanding and we supported numerous racial justice organizations in innovative ways. We also strengthened our commitment to financial inclusion, with an explicit emphasis in our corporate strategy and goals. And we recently earned a perfect score from human rights campaign foundations, 2022, Corporate Equality Index, a leading national benchmarking tool on corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertaining to LGBTQ employees. I'm proud that our inclusive and welcoming culture has been recognized by such a prestigious organization. We've driven all this change and yet our journey is not complete. We continue to push to reach our gender [Indiscernible] goals globally, and our representation goals, and to foster even greater equity and inclusion from our associates. Finally, on our environmental stewardship, we publicly announce our commitment to achieve net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions related to leased facilities by 2030. You can read about these topics and many others in detail in our next sustainability and diversity report which we expect to publish this spring. So let me start with the fourth quarter. We posted very strong results with broad-based growth across our businesses as our regions in end-user markets benefited from continued positive momentum, as well as new wins and successful innovation. We continue to drive above-market performance by executing our growth playbook that focuses on repeatable differentiated go-to-market approaches, industry-leading innovation, and complementary expansion into adjacent markets. In U.S. markets, we delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth with strong performance in financial services, insurance, media, and tenant and employment screening. Internationally, we saw very strong results in India and Latin America where we hold leadership positions in markets with strong growth trends. Todd will provide more details about the performance of our businesses shortly. Now, I want to spend a minute on the market backdrop that has fueled 2021 results and sets the stage for our strong growth in 2022 in organic revenue guidance. On an organic basis, we expect to grow 5.5% to 7.5% in total. Those growth rates increase to 9% to 11% excluding the declining mortgage segment. Although mortgage -- although the mortgage market began to decline last year from its record levels, most of our other markets have bounced back strongly from the depth of the COVID crisis in 2020. Overall, our markets have proven resilient and continued their return to more typical levels. And while the surge in COVID infections temporarily inhibited a full recovery, our markets and our customers have become effective at operating under pandemic conditions, enabled in part by the ongoing digital transformation. In most markets, we saw, and continue to see, robust consumer spending. In the U.S., consumer balance sheets have strengthened during the pandemic due to government benefits, repayment moratoriums, and restricted consumer mobility. Internationally, we see similar trends, along with meaningful pent-up consumer demand. Our markets also benefit from renewed marketing activity, as clients resume their efforts to grow their businesses. We've seen historically strong customer acquisition programs from consumer lenders and credit card issuers in the U.S., Canada, and the UK. And we expect this broad strength to continue into 2022. Also, and importantly, consumers remain well-positioned to fully re-engage economically. In recent earnings commentary, some of the largest U.S. financial institutions have referenced the health of U.S. consumers and forecast robust lending growth in 2022. Now as we consider our long-term growth prospects, we believe that the increase in digitalization of economic activity provides opportunities to serve customer needs in marketing and fraud mitigation. This premise motivated our acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq and our investments in Monevo and IDfy. Most recently, we've invested in India -based online PSB loans, an online lending platform that enables borrowers, primarily, micro, small, and medium enterprises, and individuals, to apply for loans online and receive in-principle approval in under one hour. These strategic moves, in particular Neustar and Sontiq, bolster our portfolio of solutions to improve identity verification and targeting precision to enable safe, tailored online consumer experiences. Now, I'd like to discuss our intent to acquire Verisk financial services division from Verisk. This is a well-known collection of assets which can enhance our positions in financial services, analytics, fraud, and marketing. The division generated $143 million in revenue in 2021 and 65% of which came from Argus, the primary business in the portfolio with which we've enjoyed a long-standing strategic partnership. Argus provides unique and authoritative data on credit and debit card spending behavior, as well as for demand deposit accounts or DDAs. This data complements our credit card vertical and analytics capabilities, generally. In the U.S., Argus covers 90% of all credit cards and 45% of all DDAs through contributions from a broad consortium of banks and card issuers. It also has coverage of large portions of card activity in the UK, Canada, and Australia. Argus offers solutions to help these consortium members increase financial inclusion, acquire new accounts, make risk decisions, mitigate fraud, and deliver relevant consumer experiences by leveraging their unique data and the associated behavioral insights. Argus is a powerful data asset that fits with TransUnion's expansive set of alternative data and serves our core financial services customers. We will also take the necessary time to fully understand each of the businesses within this portfolio and their potential fit with existing TransUnion assets. With that said, we see a clear path to deliver an enhanced value proposition to our customers, resulting in improved revenue growth and margin performance, which I'll detail in a minute. We intend to pursue four primary growth opportunities that will benefit Consortium members. First, we will better utilize the full wallet view of the consumer that Argos currently offers, by leveraging the analytics derived from the Argos data and combining that with our robust market insights. The full wallet view provides insight into consumer behavior from an initial transaction or deposit through card usage and loan payment. This is critical for financial services customers to make better risk fraud and marketing decisions. Second, we will modernize the delivery of Argus ' data and insights by leveraging our technology capability. Currently, customers receive static reports from Argus that don't allow them to visualize, augment, model or manage the data. We plan to deliver a highly interactive product using the Prama platform which is already used by many lenders as the visualization and analytics tool. Third, we see the opportunity to expand Argus ' data coverage in addressable market. We can leverage our relationships with banks in the U.S., to grow the deposit database well beyond the current 45% penetration, and increase benchmarking value for Consortium participants. And although Argus data is anonymized, we believe we can derive valuable signal to identify lending fraud, to make superior risk decisions into better target consumers for Consortium participants. These behavioral insights will improve the predictive power of solutions such as our credit vision and credit vision link products, which in turn will create more value and stickiness for those solutions with our banking customers. Now let me wrap up with the deal terms in a discussion of the financial impact of executing these growth strategies. The purchase price for the division is $515 million, which is a 12.5x adjusted EBITDA, an attractive price for such a unique data asset. We expect the transaction to close in the 2nd quarter of this year. Now, as I noted, the business had revenue of $143 million in FY '21. and while revenues have declined in recent years, we believe that TransUnion brings the financial market focus, the data and analytic capabilities, the sales resources and a host of complementary assets to reverse this decline and resume growth. And as we integrate Argus in 2022, we anticipate growth in the low-single-digits. In 2023, we expect growth to improve to the high single-digits and then reach the low double-digit range by 2024. In 2021, the business delivered roughly $41 million of adjusted EBITDA, or about a 29% margin. Now, for those of you who follow Verisk, you'll notice that the adjusted EBITDA figure is higher than in Verisk previous public disclosures. This is because Verisk allocates certain corporate costs to the financial services division that TransUnion will not require. Therefore, the portfolio will generate more profit than previously disclosed. And even as we increase investment in these businesses, we'll improve the margin over the next four years through revenue growth and cost savings actions. We expect to achieve 40% margins by 2026, further reducing our acquisition multiple. And finally, as we're able to fund this transaction with cash, it will be immediately accretive in 2022 after we close. Data assets of the quality of Argus are rare, and so we're pleased to add it to our portfolio and to strengthen our core business for the long run. Now let me turn to our Sontiq acquisition, which leverages a cloud-based technology infrastructure to provide solutions to help consumers and businesses protect against identity theft and cybercrime, including identity monitoring, restoration, and breach response solutions. The acquisition creates an entry point into the fast-growing ID protection market, that has been driven by rapid digitization and the evolution of online commerce. In this environment, consumers have a heightened awareness and concern over the risks of identity theft. Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market, fueling long-term growth. Sontiq also helps us transition from a credit education and monitoring provider, to a fuller provider of sophisticated identity protection, augmenting both our direct and indirect consumer businesses. It provides us access to new attractive end markets, like employee benefits, while expanding our position in current markets such as insurance. And Sontiq provides incremental capabilities including dark web monitoring, transaction and child monitoring, and proprietary capabilities for breach risk assessment. Now, we closed this acquisition on December 1st and our team has begun a smooth integration. We have transitioned key Sontiq employees into senior leadership positions to ensure the continuity in retention of their valuable market and product knowledge. This has also allowed us to quickly bring together both sales and product development teams. We believe this influx of talent and innovation capabilities will accelerate the long-term revenue growth of our consumer interactive business. And finally, on a pro forma basis in 2021, Sontiq revenue was approximately $87 million, an increase of 18% compared to 2020 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%, but it would've been about 40% absent one-time deal-related expenses. In going forward, we expect the business to grow low double-digits at an approximately 40% margin in 2022 on the strength of the underlying digital protection market, and the benefits of the combination with TransUnion solutions. Now, turning to Neustar, this acquisition substantially strengthens our identity resolution capabilities for a variety of online applications. Neustar provides real time identity resolution through its state-of-the-art oneID platform, powering solutions that currently serve three attractive markets: marketing, fraud mitigation, and communications. As we bring these capabilities together within TransUnion, we bolster our already strong identity resolution capabilities with accurate in the Fortinet PII, generating incremental scale and scope in those three complementary markets that Neustar serves. As we expand in these high-growth non-credit markets, we further diversify our portfolio, which contributes to our ability to consistently outperform our underlying markets. We closed the acquisition on December 1st, and began the integration immediately, while also giving the Neustar team space to conclude a very strong year, which they did. For 2021, the pro forma organic revenue was $585 million, which is up 8%, and with double-digit growth in the marketing business. This coincides with about 40% organic growth for TU 's marketing solutions in 2021. Now, Neustar adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, which is better than our expectations. In 2022, we expect the business to deliver another year of high single-digit on organic revenue growth driven by strong performance in marketing and fraud. Approximately 90% of the Neustar business is based on previous year bookings, which lends further confidence to our growth expectations. And along with the strong results, we have pulled forward some cost synergies. We're now -- we now anticipate generating roughly $160 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2022, which would produce a 25% margin. Now, all of these financial metrics have come in stronger than our initial expectations when we announced the transaction in September. And it reinforces our confidence that the business can deliver low double-digit revenue growth beginning in 2023 and that margins can progress, adjusted EBITDA margins, to approximately 40% by 2026. In the short time we've owned the business, we found Neustar employees to be very engaged and enthusiastic about joining TransUnion. They too can see the opportunities created by the combination. We've also identified roles for the senior executives from Neustar bringing clarity to both organizations and ensuring consistency as we go forward. Notably, we created a new functional area with NTU, a global data and analytics that will be headed by Venkat Achanta, the former Chief Data and Chief Technology Officer of Neustar. Now, Venkat was the principal executive driving the development of Neustar's oneID platform, and this new organization will bring further focus to the data and analytics growth enabling TransUnion. And finally, Neustar's CEO Charles E. Gottdiener, joined our Board in January. Charlie has decade-long experience in leading information services and technology companies driving innovation and scaling operations. And together with his experience at Neustar, this makes him a tremendous addition to our board. Now, all of that presents a good segue to an update on our -- the development of our global technology platform or Project Rise. Project Rise is a cloud based global engineering effort that makes TransUnion 's technology more efficient, scalable, secure, and effective, by streamlining processes and increasing automation. Our ongoing investment enables us to further streamline our application ecosystem and transition to a more modern API based and services oriented software architecture. As part of this investment, we've assessed and rationalized our applications globally to reduce sprawl with a plan to ultimately shift over 50% of these applications to the public cloud. We recently received approval to operate a credit bureau in Brazil and have deployed, on our AWS technology, a new cloud-based credit bureau platform to establish our position in that attractive market. Now this platform will enable us to deploy existing and enhanced bureau services including real-time streaming data ingestion and delivery in a flexible, scalable infrastructure. Additionally, we are layering policy as code, which is built into the provisioning of our AWS capacity, so as it comes online, it is fully loaded with the necessary compliance, model governance and security, as well as our operational and development standards. And we're delivering these benefits through our continuous improvement in deployment pipeline. Today, 90% of our applications that are targeted for migration to the cloud are utilizing these infrastructure and policy code pipeline. These shifts allow us to reduce our data-center footprint by as much as 60%, creating tremendous efficiencies. Now, all of this work is being completed largely by our internal talent and our expertise including the almost 1500 associates globally that are now certified in cloud technologies. Building this internal capability will benefit us in the long run, as we are creating a cloud native workforce, with an efficient way to build IP in a sustained manner, which brings us to Neustar. Neustar has been on a similar path with Google Cloud for a consistent architecture, security and governance, and improved operational efficiency. With the acquisition, we have a unique opportunity to enhance and to complement our technology by leveraging Neustar's oneID platform and their established Cloud confidence to support all of our non-credit based solutions. This will result in a scalable, in a secure, in an effective environment, while being a Cloud provider agnostic with an upskill technology workforce. Given the expanded vision and the integration activities of the multiple acquisitions, along with the divestiture of our Healthcare business, we're extending the timeline for this technology work through 2024. And to support our aspirations to become a best-in-class technology organization, we're increasing our planned investment to $215 million to $240 million versus the original range of $150 million to $175 million. Now since the start of our technology transformation, we have realized savings that we anticipated, and we've opportunistically reinvested them in technology, in solutions and expanded operations. As we continue to deliver on our technology transformation and to generate future savings, we'll either continue to reinvest them or we'll let them fall through to the bottom line. Now with that, let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our fourth quarter financial results in detail and our first quarter and full-year FY '22 guidance. Over to you, Todd. Thank you, Todd. And to conclude, TU delivered another strong quarter and full year while also making strategic acquisitions and investments that will better position us for long-term differentiated growth. We expect to have another very good year in 2022, driven by continuation of strong market conditions and executing our growth playbook. And looking ahead, we will hold our first Investor Day in three years on March 15th. At the event, we'll introduce our next-generation strategic framework and provide an updated multi-year financial outlook. I'll be joined by a dozen TransUnion leaders who'll cover a broad range of important topics including our vertical and geographic markets, global solutions, operations, technology and talent and diversity and inclusion strategies. We're excited to share the next chapter in our story, particularly on the heels of our recent transformative M&A. And with that, let me turn it back to Aaron. Okay. Good morning, Jeff. This is Chris, and thanks for the question. We talked about marketing revenues in the marketing business. First, these are revenues that are derived outside credit business. These are [Indiscernible] diversification, investments, and acquisitions that we've made both at TU but also that we anchored with the large Neustar acquisition last year. So the assets independent of Neustar at TU grew about roughly 40% and we have expectations for continued strong growth going into FY \u201822. Now, as Todd mentioned, the Neustar business in total, through 9%, 8% of that was organic, but the marketing component within Neustar was low double-digits. So as you think about 2022, as we have combined organizationally, our marketing, vertical leadership, and product development and our sellers and we start to combine our datasets and capabilities, you're talking about a marketing business that is positioned to grow low double-digits at least. So we're really excited about what we're seeing. And frankly, we feel with Neustar and with our marketing business, we're running well ahead of schedule. I think the other thing that I would point out is that, the profitability of the business is scaling rapidly as we expected when we made the acquisition and we conveyed to the market. Our profitability from Neustar for this year, the expectation is about $160 million, which was above our initial expectations of roughly $145, $150 - ish. I'll pause there and see if Todd wants to add anything. Sure, Andrew, we can do all of that. And obviously, there's a lot going on within TransUnion as we execute on transformative strategy and really expand our product capabilities in terms of whether we can handle it? I would ask you to look at our results from the core business for both the third quarter and this fourth quarter, where on a comparable basis, we continue to perform at the high-end of the market. The core is very strong. I'd also ask for you to look at the performance of the Neustar acquisition and the Sontiq acquisition in the early days. These are; the growth full assets, the growth rates accelerating, and the profitability of scaling. We feel like we are ahead of all of our expectations and we're really comfortable with the way things are going. Now, when you get to the Argus portfolio, I think it's important to remember that 65% of the a $143 million comes from the Argus asset itself. And that asset is entirely complementary with TransUnion's focus on financial services, which remains a high proportion of our revenues globally. And in fact, in our specialized market approach, we have a dedicated credit card marketing vertical. It's one of the largest single verticals within TransUnion. And this gives us a very special asset and analytic capability that is unique amongst the bureaus. As the market is long noted, the Argus data asset is highly differentiated and many in sell-side have speculated that it was an asset better owned by one of the bureaus. We believe that's the case that we bring the appropriate market focus, not only in the U.S. but across all the geographies that we operate in. Additionally, you have to remember that one of our largest product investments in recent years has been in the Prama platform. The Prama platform is designed to deliver data to clients and analytic capabilities that allows them to visualize and interact and model with the data in a very powerful way but also a very user-friendly way. The Argus product, I think given the lack of scale or potentially fit, has not evolved similar capability. It is still largely a PDF or paper-based delivery of benchmarking in analytic services and then a subsequent iteration with the consortium clients. We're going to be able to migrate the data and the deliberate to the Prama platform in relatively short order, and create a step change in value add for Consortium members. On top of that, because we live in this space, we think we're going to be able to create new products based on the existing dataset that will add more value to the Consortium, that we'll be able to grow coverage on the demand deposit side given our expansive relationships with the banking sector, and that there is even potential to extend, if not, to reinforce the Argus franchise in various other markets that we have strong positions such as the UK but just can't [Indiscernible] I realized there's a lot going on but you should think of this acquisition of the Financial Services Division, one; of giving us a unique asset in greater scale in analytics, beefing up our analytics product capabilities but also giving us a unique asset to support our card marketing, our card business. And also the remainder of the assets have nice overlap. We're a big player in fraud. They have nice fraud mitigation assets. Obviously, we're doing well with our marketing investments. They've got some marketing assets that complement. So we think we are a very good owner of this asset and that it's a fit with our various market positions and our growth plans. Yes. Manav, I think we got the majority of your question. Your voice is a little faint there. But let me start with the acquisition of workloads. I mean, obviously that was a very important consideration before we went forward. And we thought about it and came to the conclusion that we're well-positioned to take on this incremental work in part because different parts of the organization are engaged in different aspects of integrating our various acquisitions. So Sontiq, it's primarily a direct-to-consumer play and Neustar is the integration and the growth is being led by the combination of our marketing product folks and our fraud folks, and then we're adding this complementary communications protocol. And then on top of that, Neustar and Sontiq have very capable technology organizations. And in the case of Neustar, it's an upscale, mature business that functions well, that had just reached a growth and an efficiently inflection point. And I think you can see that in that -- our profits are scaling from roughly $115 million in FY '21 to an expected $160 million in FY '22. Now, Argus will be driven primarily by the hard sub-vertical within financial services overall. Argus operated largely separate from Verisk, and has an independent technology organization that's really going to benefit from an influx of financial services, data and analytics know-how. I just spoke extensively to Andrew 's question about the capabilities that Prama brings a modernize the delivery of that technology. Now, Argus, as you said, has been lower growth in recent years and there's been a combination of factors. I mean, one, I think we bring the focus as I've said. Two, the delivery of the service has needed to be digitized for some time. And again, I'll point you to Prama. We've spent a considerable amount developing this facility -- have a substantial pool of recurring revenue that's going to anchor that technology and it gives us -- or continued use case innovation for growing the data and for delivering additional kind of analytics tools within its overall sandbox that will add a lot of value for consortium members. And then also look, as we looked at the asset, we realized that in recent years, in particular this past year, the pandemic has had the most profound impact on the portfolio, in the early phases of the pandemic card marketers, more or less aggressive, they pulled back and that in part reduced their need for the discretionary analyses that they would undertake with Argus. Also a big contributor to the overall decline is the LCI bankruptcy data business. We're a consumer of bankruptcy data. And as you may know, Manav, the level of bankruptcies in the U.S. is off by over 50% these past two years. And that's because of all the government intervention and the repayment for bearances across the economy. While we're exiting that period, and as bankruptcies returned to a normal level, you're going to see an appreciation in some of these related assets. And again, in our diligence, and particularly with a focus on Argus, we could see in the second half the pipeline building, sales increasing, and we feel like we're coming into FY '22 with some momentum. And if I can weigh in just a little bit here, I just want to point out that we at the initial guide, if you will, for the profitability of these acquisitions. And so our confidence is higher and the execution is going well. And as for the increase in the overall cost to complete the development of our global engineering platform in the Cloud, it's really proportional to the increased size of our business. The M&A has given us considerably more revenues. We're on pace to be a little bit under $4 billion this year. But again, round numbers not guide, don't get excited. but we're substantially larger organization. But there's also more technology that we want to harmonize, that we want to share a common foundation and a common set of engineering services and security approaches, if you will, and so we increased the budget to achieve that. You have to point out that Neustar is a very strong technology organization, that they've been operating in the Cloud for over six years now, and that in fact, their experience in Cloud operations and the foundation that they have built is really informing and accelerating some of the work that we're doing around here. And in the end, I think the combination of, or rather having a mature tech foundation in both the Amazon Cloud and the Google Cloud is a good kind of competitive position with these key vendors. And so we like this multi-cloud approach that we're able to evolve to given Neustar's capabilities. Yeah, it's a good question, Toni, and I appreciate it. And again, the core business is performing extremely well. And the growth rates are top of market. And I think it's really, look, we're leveraging the momentum that we've built since the LBO forward. And our growth is based on really deep understanding and insights of customer needs. It's why we invest so much in our vertical market capabilities. For example, we don't just have a financial services vertical. We have a mortgage vertical, and we have a card vertical, on auto lending vertical, a consumer vertical, etc., because these are all different flavors of lending that have meaningfully different needs, and we've got people who come from those industries who connect well at the sea level there, that market through thought leadership. And then we backed it up with innovative and increasingly broad suite of interrelated products. And if you think of that strategy, you can see how the Argus data asset fits nicely into that because an important part of our value add is managing the data and creating the tools in the platform to yield important analyses that help our clients make better decisions and take more effective actions. What we're seeing is a robust market. We think things are looking good in terms of an expansion of lending volume in FY '22. Now, of course, the mortgage bubble is unwinding. We saw a deceleration in the fourth quarter, and we're forecasting further contraction. But despite that, we're able to post some pretty attractive organic growth. And again, when you think about the FY '22 guide and you pull out mortgage, the remainder of the business is we're guiding at 9% to 11% organic, which is pretty tremendous on top of comps that we've posted in the third and fourth quarter of FY '21, which again are at the top of market. So my overall messaging is, look, the core is proving as strong and performant as it ever has. And the acquisitions that we made, albeit there were some initial concerns, they're performing well in excess of the expectations we set on multiple financial metrics. We think we're successfully broadening the number of things we can do for our clients and we're executing quite well in the early days. Andrew. Thanks for the question. Yes. So the consortium of lenders that contribute the card transaction in information on a depersonalized basis. The 18 member strong consortium gives us over 90% coverage of card transactions in the U.S. And then we've got majority market coverage in Canada, the U.K., and Australia. And of course with TransUnion, we feel we've got the ability to take this model to other countries where it doesn't exist because we are focused on the financial services sector in all the countries in which we operate. Now in the U.S., the Consortium also decided to contribute demand deposits information. Demand deposit accounts are less concentrated than credit cards accounts, so the current coverage is about 45%. And that data is used to do a variety of performance benchmarking between the Consortium members that inform their management practices. Well, TransUnion covers the entirety of the financial services market in the U.S. And we think that there is appetite for that type of benchmarking and other analytics that we can provide some that data as you go down market, and that having broader coverage would enrich the value of the assets overall. So we believe that we can leverage our selling and our business relationships generally to increase their contributions of demand deposit activity. Now, as to your question about verified income or other insights, I want to be clear that this asset is not used for those purposes currently, it is an analytic tool and it's a benchmarking tool. That said, it is -- both the card data and the DDA data are extremely unique in valuable data assets that can fuel, I think, a generation of innovation at TransU, right? But that's where our focus is today. And again, look, I understand that there's a lot going on here. That's by design. This is a period where we can really increase our product coverage and lay a foundation of data and capabilities for another generation of growth. But we feel like this is a great asset for us, for all the reasons we've mentioned. We feel like the acquisition price is fair and attractive in that -- it's 12.5 times EBITDA for a differentiated data asset, and that include -- and that's exclusive of the revenue in the cost synergies that we have -- we believe that we have because of our intense focus on financial services. Yeah, I can in general terms, George, so what I'll say is look, we -- we've been part -- we know this asset very well because we've been partnered with them for over a decade. And we watched performance of the asset, and we understand why its performance has been distressed in recent years, particularly in this past year where it was in the full grips of the pandemic. Now, this was a focal point for us in our due diligence. So as we completed our commercial due diligence, we talked to a wide range of customers and they all said that the Argus data asset is extremely valuable. That they fully intended to continue to utilize it, go forward. And that they even expected to increase the discretionary analytics they'd previously asked for now that they've entered into a more customer-acquisition oriented period, one of robust growth. Part of this acquisition is a bet that we are acquiring the asset at the end of a market bottom, if you will. Now, the other feedback we received from clients was that they really wanted to improve the technology delivery capabilities. And again, Argus recently released an early version of a new and improved platform that provides some of the functionalities declines that we envision providing. But of course, we have Prama. And again, Prama has been -- we've been investing in it for four or five years now, tens of millions dollars and it is a state-of-the-art cloud-based data visualization, data analysis and delivery platform that is ideally suited for the type of data and studies that markets have. So this is another reason why we are good owner. And we're also bringing a large, dedicated sales force to this product. Verisk, did not have such a sales force. We do in our sale people, buttressed by the thought leadership our verticals provide, are really good at helping clients get additional value from these type of analytics. So it's another reason why we think we can grow the assets. And again, we can expand the data coverage, particularly in demand deposits, we can expand geographically, and we can innovate and develop new use cases for our clients that we can monetize. Maybe it will be some price there as we prove ourselves as the worthy owner, delivering some increased value-add to the Consortium. But again, I think if you look at the entry multiple and also the fact that we've got considerable revenue -- considerable synergies, both revenue and expense, this is a good opportunity for us and it will be immediately accretive and we think will create a lot of shareholder value from this deal. And listen, we came away after the commercial diligence even more positive about the assets than we were previously, and in the early hours here, post announcement, we're getting great feedback from a multitude of Consortium members to really get the industrial logic of this asset in the hands of a bureau like TransUnion."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Hope that all of you remain safe and healthy. On the call today we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and, in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that out of the way, my pleasure to turn things over to Chris Cartwright.\nChris Cartwright: Let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll discuss the resilience of our markets along with some of the broad macro trends that we experienced in the third quarter. I'll also update you on our strong underlying business performance that reflects our ability to execute the growth playbook that I've outlined on previous calls. Next, I will discuss our strategic ambitions, and how our recently announced acquisitions and divestitures support them. We continue to build off a strong foundation in identity resolution that's applied broadly across our various solutions and all of our end market. This capitalizes on our strengths as a credit bureau as we extend and scale our marketing risk authentication and fraud solutions to enable better consumer experiences in a digital environment. As part of this discussion, I'll offer some additional comments about our recently announced acquisition of Neustar. I'll also provide color on today's announced acquisition of Sontiq, a highly complementary business that empowers consumers with identity protection solutions. I'll also touch on two attractive equity investments we made in financial technology firms in the UK and India. Each furthers our consumer identity focus strategy. And at the same time, our decision to divest TransUnion Healthcare both helps to fund these attractive acquisitions, and to sharpen our focus on our core markets and capabilities. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our third quarter results in detail, along with fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Let me start with the third quarter. We posted very strong results as most of our markets continued to rebound and our growth outpaced underlying market recovery on the strength of our growth playbook, namely, new business wins, a steady stream of new product innovation and success in attractive adjacent markets. In the US, we've never seen a healthier consumer balance sheet driving consumer spending above pre COVID levels in spurring more aggressive marketing by our customers. We expect us to drive further upside in most of our US businesses, particularly consumer lending, credit card and employment screening. At the same time, we continue to see a phased recovery across our international markets, and notably did not see any meaningful COVID related setback in our major markets during the quarter. Despite another quarter of robust performance, we expect to see significant further recovery over the next several quarters in emerging markets, such as India, the Philippines, South Africa and much of Latin America. Importantly, beyond market based recovery, we continue to deliver growth above our underlying markets, reflecting a combination of market recovery and organic growth. Given our strong third quarter and increasingly positive macro environment, we've raised our full year 2021 guidance again, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high single digit revenue growth at an expanding attractive margin with double digit EPS growth. We believe our strategic evolution to further support consumers and customers in an ecommerce environment provides the next chapter of our growth story. With that point today, I want to talk about our focus on improving identity verification, and targeting precision to enable safe, tailored consumer experiences as we feel attractive white spaces created by a more digitized economy in building off of our legacy capabilities as a credit bureau. For decades, the national credit bureaus have operated at the intersection of credit analysis, marketing, and fraud mitigation. We engage with the risk management arm of a consumer lender to help them understand the broader credit market. We then help them develop the audience that they want to reach through our batch pre-screened services. Traditionally, that offer would arrive via direct mail, relying on our header information built on broad and authoritative terrestrial data. If the consumer response to the offer, they didn't contact the call center to activate it. And during that process, they're authenticated using knowledge based questions likely derived from our credit information or public records data. TransUnion sits at the center of all three dimensions of this activity, credit analysis, target marketing and fraud mitigation. With a growth in ecommerce, we began to evolve our strategy to incorporate digital identity. How can we combine still valuable PII with new identifiers, such as email addresses, cell numbers, device IDs, advertising IDs, geolocation data, URLs, and cookies, the acquisitions of TLO and iovation with its comprehensive digital device data laid a valuable foundation that we augmented with the later purchases of TruSignal, Signal, and Tru Optik to build out our marketing capabilities. Each of these investments furthered our ability to accurately link and match data to consumers. What we would now call our identity graph, both offline and online data, helping our clients enrich their customer intelligence with the digital information necessary to target consumers across media channels. For marketers, for instance, this solves a fundamental problem that outside of the walled gardens, less than half of the time, businesses don't know exactly who they're interacting with on the so called open web. With our digital identifiers, and modern technology stack, we can help answer the question who am I dealing with in a digital environment. And with that knowledge, our customers can ensure that the right customers are receiving the right offers with minimal friction or in the case of bad actors putting up the necessary barriers to prevent fraud. Now with that as a backdrop, the pending acquisition of Neustar significantly enhances our identity resolution capabilities for a variety of online applications. As a reminder, we expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. Neustar provides real time identity resolution through its oneID platform, powering solutions that serve three attractive markets, marketing, online fraud mitigation, and communications. Now we've talked about the power of bringing these capabilities together with TransUnion. Bolstering our already strong identity resolution capabilities, and accurate authoritative PII, generating incremental scale and scope in the three complementary markets that Neustar serves. As we expand in these high growths, non-credit markets, we further diversify our portfolio, which contributes to our ability to consistently outperform our underlying markets. Additionally, the complementary capabilities and data enabled innovation and cross-selling that further fuels our ability to deliver above market growth. Finally, we're particularly excited about the influx of strong and relevant talent, including in high impact areas like data science, engineering and sales. With considerable strength in developing solutions, we see a great fit with our highly evolved vertical market strategy. And as a result of the substantial benefits, we expect our long-term growth rate will accelerate over time. Now, let's step back for a moment and talk about the journey that Neustar has been on in recent years. They have evolved into a very different company today than the one that many people knew before they were taken private, in 2017. And frankly, as we look at Neustar today, we believe that they've gone through a similar transformation as TransUnion and today are at both a growth and financial inflection point. Neustar new leadership and PE owners made broad meaningful improvements in the business. They implemented organizational leadership, cultural, strategic, and operational changes to position the company for long-term growth. These include new leadership and key functions, investment and sales, account management, and product development, along with data science, and marketing talent and processes, implementation of a cloud based and scalable product and technology stack, and fully realizing the vision of the oneID identity resolution platform. So let me spend a minute on the power of oneID, which is a modern, cloud native AI enabled connected platform that solves the complex problem of resolving multiple identity signals into single individuals or households. OneID today uses proprietary data and analytic capabilities to deliver market leading identity resolution accuracy, across disparate online and offline signals. With signal strength, generating insight, from high volume observable events, and the breadth and depth of scale the market requirements requires rather, as part of its oneID centric strategy Neustar made new product investments, leveraging oneID and proprietary Decision Analytics to drive differentiated value propositions and marketing fraud in communications, and organic growth initiatives have been complemented by tuck-in acquisitions to broaden and strengthen their solutions. As Neustar sits at the inflection point, between significant investment and growth acceleration, we see a long path of opportunities to drive incremental revenues. We think about this in three waves. Initially, cross-selling, then innovating from the combined data and technology assets, and longer term taking the oneID platform and related marketing fraud and data management solutions across our global markets. In the first phase as an example, Neustar had success with very large financial services customers, but less so with mid market lenders where TransUnion has considerable sales coverage in strength. Our teams will begin to sell a number of Neustar solutions to the mid market accounts quickly after we close the transaction. And it's a similar story in the insurance and other verticals. On the other hand, Neustar has a well-established foothold in markets such as technology, retail, ecommerce and telecommunications, where we've been growing and building a presence, but lack the kind of scale and strong relationships with C-suite decision makers than Neustar has. This opens the door to cross sell TransUnion solutions to these customers. In the second wave, we envision developing new solutions built on our combined data asset, assets that leverage the strength of oneID to enhance our industry leading innovation. That might include leveraging data analytics from Neustar to better develop a household view for our insurance customers or to develop a closed loop marketing solution. And in the third wave, we will extend oneID to our international markets. The oneID platform has cleared global applications that were part of Neustar's long-term strategy by combining their best-in-class technology with our data assets and customer relationships around the globe; we will position ourselves to deliver superior identity resolution in our local markets, allowing us to drive incremental growth. I'd also like to spend a moment discussing marketing solutions. You have heard us talk a lot about our opportunity in fraud space in the past, but not as much about what we can do in marketing by leveraging the same identity resolution capabilities that we do in fraud. Neustar provides identity based solutions that enable marketers to better understand their consumers, message to them effectively and orchestrate personalized experiences across channels and optimize the effectiveness of their marketing investments. We have no interest in becoming an ad tech company or a measurement currency. Rather, we aspire to deliver best-in-class data and analytics to help our customers make better decisions, just as we do in other parts of our business. Combining TransUnion and Neustar capabilities creates an identity precision targeting and marketing performance optimization suite required to operate in a world without cookies or device ID. With Neustar, we have the opportunity to become the leading marketing centered identity solutions provider that enables personalized marketing, and can measure its effectiveness. As with the entirety of our business, this is a data centric solution, where we have broad authoritative data now combined with best-in-class technology and analytics to make that data actionable. We have great conviction that our proposed investment in Neustar will significantly advance our ambitions in this large and quickly evolving space. Let me move to another transformational growth opportunity. Today, we also announced our intent to acquire Sontiq for $638 million, and we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Leveraging a cloud based technology infrastructure, Sontiq provides solutions to help consumers and businesses protect against identity theft and cybercrime, including identity monitoring, restoration, and breach response products and services. The current owners executed a smart roll up strategy beginning in 2017, to bring together complementary assets to provide identity protection solutions. Today, they serve a broad range of customers primarily in employee benefits, insurance financial services in the public sector. The acquisition is attractive for three primary reasons. First, ID protection is an attractive, fast growing market driven by the rapid evolution of online commerce that I've already discussed. In this environment, consumers have a heightened awareness of a concern about the risks of identity theft. However, many of them are reluctant to enroll in a service that's not supported by a trusted brand like TransUnion. We've seen the impact of this market demand in our consumer inactive business over the past several years. And Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market fueling stronger growth long term. Second, the acquisition fits nicely with our ongoing evolution to provide data driven identity solutions for consumers and customers as they more frequently interact and transact online. Four our consumer interactive business that entails empowering consumers by helping them understand their credit profile, improve their access to goods and services, advance their financial standing, and protect the financial profile that they build. Sontiq helps us transition from a credit data provider to a full solutions provider combining core credit monitoring with sophisticated identity protection, augmenting both our direct and indirect businesses. It provides us access to new attractive end markets like employee benefits, and expanding our position in current markets such as insurance. And Sontiq provides incremental capabilities such as dark web monitoring, transaction and child monitoring and proprietary capabilities for breach risk assessment. Finally, in addition to being a strong strategic fit that will enable growth, the business already has an attractive financial profile with $85 million of estimated revenue in 2021, at a roughly 40% margin, we expect the transaction to be neutral to adjusted EPS in 2022 and accretive after that. We expect the business to grow in the low double digits in the future on the strength of the underlying digital identity protection market, and the benefits of combining with TransUnion. So, like Neustar, we expect Sontiq to accelerate our long-term revenue growth. And let me wrap up with a brief discussion of some attractive equity investments that we made recently. The first Monevo extends further our presence in the fast growing online lending market, and again advances our ability to support customers and consumers in the rapid transition to ecommerce that I described earlier. Monevo delivers pre-qualification services to lenders, and price comparison websites, mainly in the UK and US to support consumer access to finance. This enables consumers to easily shop for credit products by obtaining multiple pre-qualified credit quotes that don't adversely affect their credit score. We also made an investment in an established commercial relationship with IDfy, an Indian provider of video based ID verification, authentication, and onboarding solutions. This partnership will enable TransUnion to offer expanded digital onboarding and verification technologies to its global customer base, including enriched video based Know Your Customer Identification. This investment also supports our agenda to capitalize on key ecommerce trends globally. And as we announced this morning, we've agreed to sell TransUnion Healthcare to nThrive backed by Clearlake Capital Group for $1.735 billion, which we believe will result in about $1.4 billion in after tax proceeds at the current tax rates. These proceeds will help fund a significant portion of the cost to acquire Neustar and Sontiq. This portfolio transformation reflects our clear focus on the best long term growth opportunities for TransUnion that I've just highlighted. And for TransUnion Healthcare, this outstanding business will benefit from being part of a pure play healthcare data and analytics business. We're targeting a fourth quarter close pending regulatory reviews. And for the TransUnion Healthcare employees, I want to extend our gratitude for all of your contributions to TransUnion over the years, as you build your fine business; we believe that TransUnion will benefit from this combination. Now let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our third quarter financial results, and our fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Over to you, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks Chris. Let me take you through our performance starting with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the third quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. The Signal and Tru Optik acquisitions had just under one point of impact, resulting in organic constant currency growth of 12%. Excluding mortgage which represented about 12% of total revenue over the past 12 months from both the third quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 17% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 21% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.3%, up 250 basis points, compared with the year ago quarter, driven primarily by the strong revenue performance. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing, prepayments and lower LIBOR. Now looking at segment financial performance, US markets revenue was up 14% compared to the year ago quarter, the two media acquisitions had about one point of impact on revenue, excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 21%. Adjusted EBITDA for US markets increased 19% on an as reported and on an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 175 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth, partially offset by our continued strategic and operational investments and the cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical; financial services revenue grew 11% and was up 31%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continued its strong rebound throughout the third quarter, as lenders across the space have aggressively stepped up their customer acquisition activity to catch your share of wallet for the historically strong consumer that Chris described. At the same time, investor funding is readily available and continues to be a strong driver of growth in this business. We also had a very strong quarter in our credit card business reflecting similar dynamics to consumer lending, as issuers proactively pursue incremental share of wallet. Much of this activity has been driven by the largest issuers and we continue to see regional players ramp up their activity levels, which should further propel this market in the quarters to come. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins helped offset a challenging environment for new and to a certain extent, used cars. While new vehicle inventory issues are well chronicle, they have a tag on effect with used cars as dealers see less trade and activity and shrinking supply that further exasperate the situation. With that said consumer demand remains high, giving us confidence that as inventory issues are resolved, volumes will return. And for mortgage for the full year, we now expect the market to be down slightly, but still near historically high levels. We had previously expected a flattish market. As we wrap up the year, rates remain lower than many anticipated, providing lift to the refi market and strengthen the purchase market despite continued inventory issues and correspondingly higher prices. Let me turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 17% on a reported basis and 14% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. We saw strong double digit growth in almost all our major verticals. Public sector delivered another very strong quarter driven by ongoing new business wins and opportunities created by changing policies and new programs from the Biden administration. Tenant and employment screening remain strong, though it has stabilized at a very high level. In tenant screening, we won meaningful new business, and our smart move platform continues to deliver strong growth. We expect employment screening to remain robust as the US continues to move toward fuller employment levels. And our media vertical continues to deliver strong double digit organic growth as we sign new accounts and see expanded usage with existing customers. Insurance also delivered another very good quarter on the strength of new business wins in 2020 and 2021, along with significant growth in our new products. Additionally, we are seeing the return of segments of consumer shopping activity that slowed considerably during the pandemic. Finally, our healthcare vertical revenue return to solid growth due to our successful sale efforts, augmented by improving front end volumes across all care settings. Volumes have slowly approached more normal levels and are starting to flow through to the back end of the business. With the market recovering our new bookings converting to revenue and back end volumes picking up the vertical is well positioned for a strong 2022. Consumer interactive revenue increased 3% as we grew in both the direct and indirect channels; adjusted EBITDA was up 4%. Our direct business continues to see a solid increase in our subscriber base with improving retention rates as consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Growth moderated from recent quarters, as we are now lapping very strong 2020 results. Our indirect channel grew again, as we continue to see strength with partners who provide identity protection for consumers. The acquisition of Sontiq will better position us in this fast growing part of the market as Chris discussed. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment revenue grew 18% as we saw trends improved in most of our regions, adjusted EBITA for international increased 31% as a result of the strong revenue growth, and particularly easy comparisons to the year ago quarter. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 16% as lending markets largely returned to normal levels, and we experienced continued strength in other markets like fraud, and online gaming and gambling. Last quarter, we mentioned a meaningful government contract that will be one time and extend over a number of quarters. Excluding that revenue, our UK business still would have grown about 9% in the quarter. Our Canadian business grew 4% in the third quarter, as we saw growth across our portfolio moderated by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter. Overall, lending markets soften in the quarter due to a slowing pace of mortgage origination and new vehicle supply challenges. Excluding the non-reoccurring breach business revenue would have grown about 6%. As we've noted on previous calls, our Canadian business has done an outstanding job securing a sizable amount of this type of business in recent years, however, is entirely unpredictable, and can be very lumpy. We can create year-over-year variances. Given the flow of breach wins in 2019 and 2020, I expect that we'll see more of this negative comparison in the next two quarters, barring new significant breach related business. In India, we grew 44%, reflecting a sharp improvement in consumer and lender activity as COVID cases have plummeted, and vaccination rates have increased significantly. This led to increasingly strong performance during the quarter, culminating with all-time high levels of inquiries, batch activity and commercial revenue. We also saw significant growth in fraud, direct-to-consumer and marketing solutions, reflecting broad strength across our diversified portfolio. Given the strength of the consumer and significant pent-up demand for consumption, we expect these trends to persist. In Latin America, revenue was up 22% as we grew in every market we serve, and importantly, realize double digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This strong growth reflects broad based market recovery and the benefits of a steady stream of new customer wins. In Asia Pacific, we grew 11% driven by positive momentum with our relaunched direct-to-consumer offering in Hong Kong and business wins with lending customers there. This strength was offset by ongoing significant market challenges in the Philippines, as the country has struggled to recover from the COVID related shutdowns. Finally, Africa increased 8% in our largest market, South Africa despite the challenges of third COVID wave and some civil unrest in July; the economy has begun to stabilize. And we continue to generate growth from CreditVision, commercial solutions and seamless onboarding for digital commerce. With the pending acquisitions of Neustar Sontiq along with the proceeds generated by selling our healthcare business, we intend to reenter the debt markets to fund the purchases. Based on our past experiences, we expect a robust market for our paper. The acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq are approximately $3.7 billion in total. We intend to fund both acquisitions with incremental debt with the net proceeds from the healthcare business, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio will be about 3.8x on December 31, 2021 pro forma basis. And the $709 million of cash we've built up on our balance sheet gives us additional opportunity for future capital deployment, including additional M&A and/or debt prepayment. As this chart shows, we have a highly credible track record of rapidly delevering, driven by our strong cash flows, and our ability to significantly improve the adjusted EBITDA of the assets we acquire. Given our cost savings and revenue growth expectations for Neustar and Sontiq, along with the Healthcare proceeds, we have confidence that we can reduce our leverage ratio to about 3.3x by the end of 2022. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Other than the equity investments, none of the transactions we've discussed today have closed. So our guidance reflects the ongoing TransUnion without acquisitions, or the divestiture of the Healthcare business. Starting with fourth quarter revenue, we expect minimal impact from foreign exchange, and no impact from M&A. Revenue is expected to come in between $764 million and $774 million or a 9% to 11% increase on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate four point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 13% to 14%, excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $293 million and $301 million, an increase of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.88 and $0.91, an increase of 10% to 14%. And for the full year, we expect one point of tailwind to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA from foreign exchange. And we expect about one point of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.075 billion to $3.085 billion, up 13% to 14%. Our guidance includes two points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue excluding mortgage on an organic tax and currency basis is expected to increase 13% to 14%. For our business segments, we expect US markets, financial services, and emerging verticals, to each is up low double digits. Excluding the impact of mortgage, US markets would be up high teens and financial services would be up more than 20%. We anticipate that international will grow approximately 20% on an as reported bassist, and we expect consumer interactive to be up mid-single digits, benefiting from some one-time breach related business in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.239 billion and $1.247 billion, up 19%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 180 to 190 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.76 and $3.79, up 25% to 26%. At this time, we have no material updates to our other guidance items like tax rate, D&A, interest expense, and capital expenditures. They remain the same as what we provided on our year-end earnings call in February. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks Todd. To conclude this morning, we took you through a strong third quarter that highlights the resilience of our markets and our ability to effectively execute our growth playbook. And as our outlook for the year has further improved, we raised our outlook for the full year for the third consecutive quarter. We also highlighted our ongoing strategic pivot to deliver solutions for consumers and our customers in a rapidly evolving online environment. The Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions will play a critical role in advancing the strategy and will deliver compelling financial performance. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I will turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Right. Thanks Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A as always, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And now we'll be glad to take those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.\nAndrewSteinerman: Hi, everybody, I'd like to know on Sontiq what's the mix of revenues between corporate or institutional revenues versus direct competitors, direct-to-consumer? And I'd also want to know who the competitors of Sontiq are? And if it's okay, I know if it's bad. I'm going to ask a second question. What were mortgages as a percentage of revenues as of the third quarter?\nChrisCartwright: Yes, so good morning, Andrew. This is Chris. And the audio faded a little bit, but I believe you asked two questions. The first is kind of the revenue mix across Sontiq which we discuss, and then also the performance of mortgage and the total of mortgage in the third quarter, right?\nAndrewSteinerman: Yes.\nChrisCartwright: Yes, let me jump into Sontiq. So the mix of revenues roughly about 25% of their revenues, are direct-to-consumer little bit more than that. Close to 20% is a direct sale to the insurance industry, where their solutions are bundled with personal and commercial policies. Direct sale into employee benefits, both to corporations directly and through brokers is another 20%. And then about 34%, 35% is into financial services, right. So it's a fairly broad mix. We like it because it gives us some additional channels for the combined suite of solutions with TU bringing credit and credit monitoring and education and like and some focused on the protection. And then Todd, why don't you handle the mortgage question?\nToddCello: Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks. And good morning, Andrew, as far as mortgage is concerned on a trailing 12 month basis, about 12% of our revenue is coming from mortgage and it's down a little bit from where we were at the end of the second quarter when we said it was about 13%.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird.\nJeffMeuler: Yes, thank you. On Sontiq, I recognize that the CI business and the immediate opportunities kind of cross-selling, I guess, both ways between Sontiq and our CI capabilities and partners and direct-to-consumer under your brand. Can you help us with the long term vision? I don't know if this is a coincidence in terms of the buzzword of identity. But as you think about bringing together Neustar capabilities, TransUnion capabilities, potentially into Sontiq, can you build some sort of super app or something that's really differentiated relative to what else is out there in the market? Thank you.\nChrisCartwright: Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. So I mean, I think you've touched on a couple of important points. At the core, we're extending the value proposition of what we can do for consumers, whether we reach them directly through our own marketing efforts and our own website, or through indirectly through different platform providers. And, look, we've had a relationship with other players where we could provide this on a partnership basis. We felt like we were missing an opportunity to develop this broader integrated suite in our arsenal and that's really Sontiq comes in. Also Sontiq has multiple channels as I just answered, but also direct-to-consumer presence and we can augment that with the full complement of our credit information. And yes, look, it's not a complete coincidence that we've acquired Neustar which is a leading provider of identity information and resolution capabilities, to help businesses target their consumers and also to protect transactions. And then now we've got this fraud and identity plays with Sontiq. I think there is some opportunity for innovation between those two positions. We also are the only bureau that owns a complete Public Records Archive and investigative solutions in the US. And again, that also gives us compelling content to engage consumers, and help them understand other dimensions of their data identity if you will and the ability to review and to correct an action. So I feel like, look, this just adds not only audience but a lot of capabilities for us to be creative with.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America Securities.\nGaryBisbee: Hey, guys, good morning. I guess you talked about each of the transactions and the financial impact that they would have on '22 and the two acquisitions each thing to be about neutral. I think that's obviously not assuming benefits from the proceeds of sale. And yet, there's also dilution from the sale. So I guess can you just give us at a high level how are you thinking about the impact of the three portfolio moves on 2022 in total?\nToddCello: Yes, sure. Hey, Gary, this is Todd. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Here's how we're thinking about implications of Neustar and Sontiq as well as Healthcare in 2022. Let me, first let me remind you of what we spoke about with Neustar back in the middle of September. So first, with Neustar, margin - from a margin perspective clearly a lower margin than TransUnion today, but we spoke about the expense energies that are they're clearly not buying the business for expense synergies, we're really excited about the top line growth. So if you take those two things kind of hand-in-hand, the business that today has got a 20% EBITDA margin, we have aspirations that over the next four to five years, it's going to scale to be something like TransUnion's margin today. However, in '22, it's a year of heavy lifting for us. So - act on our margin, from an earnings per share perspective, we did say that it would be slightly dilutive in 2022, but then accretive as we go forward, beyond, if you then turned to Sontiq, Sontiq as we covered this morning, we're expecting, if you look at the margin that's kind of implied in the numbers that we've put out there. It's already carrying margins similar to TransUnion's margins. So that will not be dilutive to the overall margin profile. From an EPS perspective, we're expecting it to be roughly about neutral in 2022. And then with growth thereafter. And then finally, Healthcare. As you can see, the numbers that we put out this morning for the size of the business, revenues about $190 million, and then mid 40% adjusted EBITDA margins, clearly that margin is higher than TransUnion's overall margin. So if you think about '22, it definitely will have a dilutive impact on the margin, as well as on earnings per share. So I would characterize '22, as a year, where we're going to integrate these acquisitions. And I think the most important thing is these are investments for the future of TransUnion to sustain the top line growth that we've enjoyed since our IPO, and that's the spirit behind everything, that we're doing here to reposition the portfolio towards attractive traders for growth. And when we'll have an Investor Day more than likely in first quarter of '22. So we'll get into all the details at that event.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrewNicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about capital allocation from here. Obviously, it's been a pretty active last couple of months. So I'm just wondering if there any other portfolio moves to make or if you're open to M&A for the right opportunity right now? Or are you planning on kind of taking a step back in the near term to, obviously handle what is a few different balls that you're juggling right now? Thank you.\nChrisCartwright: Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew, what a difference a quarter makes right. Second quarter, we got a lot of questions about the degree to which we deleveraged and toward debt ratio of 2x EBITDA by the end of year, and even some questions about whether we were going to increase the dividend, all a great thing to do. But as we said then, we were active in M&A discussions that advanced our strategy, and broaden our value proposition to the markets that we serve. We've now executed on a few of these, including the divestiture of our Healthcare business, which was designed in part to free capital to pay for these portfolio management moves that we've been making, but also to liberate the business and combine it with an asset that can help accelerate its growth, right. So I think it's exciting on a couple of levels. There's a lot going on in the M&A market, obviously, we've made some big moves here. And these are moves designed to drive nation, ultimately growth. And so we've got to digest them, and apply our talent and our innovation capacity to getting the most out of these acquisitions, because each one is very synergistic with a core position we have, and it's really a bet that these moves, one plus one can be more than two, right. And we believe that is the case. That said, we don't like never say never, and we're open to other moves that would advance the strategy. But we have to be mindful, of course of our balance sheet and not taking on too much debt. And also our ability to digest all of this. So we execute effectively. And then I think I'll pass it over to Todd, to talk a bit more about our thinking on debt.\nToddCello: Yes, thanks, Chris. So as I showed in the slides, you can see the leverage ratio that we're anticipating, so just to kind of go back and reiterate on that, if you looked at all of 2021. And on a pro forma basis, you layer in Neustar, Sontiq and subtract out the Healthcare business leverage ratio would be at 3.8x, and we've publicly said for a number of years, that our target leverage ratio is about 3.5x. So we're just slightly ahead of that. But as we also shown in our prepared materials, we're expecting that for full year 2022 that the leverage ratio will tick down to 3.3x. So the characteristics of TransUnion business model are full on display, with these acquisitions, as well because of the margins, free cash flows that businesses generate, ultimately, increased capacity that as well to gives us the confidence that we'll be able to delever. So with that being said, the ability to delever does create capacity for us on an M&A perspective. So, as Chris said, no, we're going to continue to look, the market is attractive right now, and but there's clearly a lot ahead of us from an integration perspective that we want to make certain that we execute flawlessly.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.\nManavPatnaik: Thank you, just two quick ones, and that is what is the, I guess the current normalized healthcare growth rate just try to understand the impact to '22 numbers and I apologize if I mistake for Sontiq like who is the competition there on the consumer side or just however you look at it.\nChrisCartwright: Yes, well, let me start with the competitive landscape for Sontiq. And then I'll hand it over to Todd, for the financial question on healthcare. Look, it's many of the players that you know already, I mean, we consider certainly Experian and Equifax have offerings in this marketplace, and bring broad suite of solutions. One of the large insurers all state has InfoArmor; there's also Identity Guard, NortonLifeLock which is a direct-to-consumer play, that certainly has a comparable suite of functionality. But with amalgam we're going to bring, I think we meet the mark of the market terms, the breadth and dimension and the offering. And then we also have some kind of some unique benefits. So obviously, credit scores and reports and a simulator. And then one and multi bureau monitoring as part of the core package, as well as monitoring the dark web, looking at transaction monitoring through bank relationships, reputation and social monitoring. And in the event of a negative occurrence, we can restore the consumers' identity, as well as pursues reimbursement of stolen funds. So we really deepened our product offering here in the direct-to-consumer business, and that's going to benefit us both in the direct market and in the indirect space. Todd on Healthcare?\nToddCello: Yes. As far as Healthcare's growth rate, I think what's important to point out here is that vertical turn to growth in the third quarter, obviously impacted by the pandemic over the last several quarters. And that's the growth rate that we experienced in certain quarters mid-single digits.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Jeffries.\nMarioCortellacci: Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just wondering if you could just touch on the rationale for selling Healthcare. Obviously, you guys have made the point that it's much better off with a healthcare focused business and can benefit from that. But were there no synergies within TransUnion? Or are there any dis-synergies from divesting? And then I know you just touched on growth with Manav. But just around the timing, and you said that volumes are approaching pre COVID levels, you've returned to growth. But could you just update us on where is the revenue and the margins are today versus pre COVID levels?\nChrisCartwright: Sure, well, we'll unpack the question, starting first with the strategic rationale for divesting Healthcare. And look, our position has been for a long time that Healthcare, both accelerated our growth, but also provided some portfolio diversification. And so we like the business and we invested in internal innovation and acquisition to grow it. However, as we've looked at the overall macro dynamics in the healthcare market over these past several years, there's a real push toward consolidation and building scale, both on the provider side, and actual healthcare providers themselves, the hospital systems, medical systems and the like. And also on the healthcare provider space, right. And so we felt like, we needed to gain scale and breadth in our offering to the marketplace in order to fully compete. But then we had a whole variety of other growth and innovation ideas. And frankly, not the balance sheet to fund it, all right, nor the pure focus on the healthcare space, that a dedicated player like nThrive backed by Clearlake can provide when the nThrive business was marketed a couple of years ago, we looked at it hard. And ultimately, we decided that given other growth ideas that we had, we needed to pass on it. But at that point, we realized that it was time to liberate this Healthcare asset that we bought, and find a really good strategic partner to combine it with. We think that the fit between nThrive and TransUnion Healthcare business is extremely complimentary. It gives us very nice and complete but not overlapping positions in the front and middle and back end of revenue cycle management. We're also excited that we're going to have a continuing business relationship with this new combined healthcare entity where we can provide them with data and analytic services to help them completely serve that are their healthcare customers. So that was, look, that was the rationale. It's bittersweet, because Healthcare has been a terrific diversification investment for TransUnion. But, we wanted to build scale, and really focus our portfolio on a collection of assets that made a lot of sense together, and were very synergistic, but could also be taken across all of the markets in which we compete around the world. Now, as synergies, yes, absolutely. There are some synergies; we're going to have an ample transition services agreement, as the new acquirer integrates our Healthcare business onto their platform. And look, over time, we'll unwind any dis-synergies, which we think are fairly minor.\nToddCello: And I'll just add on to that, from a financial point of view, obviously, we put the numbers out, you see the revenue, we said, 190, approximately, in 2021 with a mid 40% adjusted EBITDA margin, I would say, I would characterize the business as one that persevered throughout the pandemic, and it was more of an issue of an impact on patient volumes during that time, and what we found is that there was absolutely nothing structural that changed. And so now what we're experiencing is volumes now returning back to more normal levels, the business is now getting back to that mid single digit growth that we were expecting, and the case in point is the performance that we just saw in the third quarter, so and Chris articulated the strategic rationale for it. So - got it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities.\nAndrewJeffrey: Hi, good morning, guys. Appreciate taking the question. I, sometimes I feel like I've been doing this too long. But I go back and I think about the Alliance Data Conversion acquisition in 2014. And some of the rationale they talked about seven years ago, it sounds like some of the rationale behind the Neustar deal. I understand there's more fraud ID resolution. And you have proprietary data that didn't exist in that deal. But can you just talk a little bit about why, from a media effectiveness standpoint, this is a different transaction, a better transaction? And maybe how the market has changed to accommodate that?\nChrisCartwright: Yes, sure. So listen, focused on what we're doing with Neustar today, and the combination of our assets. I guess at the most basic and strategic level to deal with Neustar helps us fully translate our traditional business model into the digital world. And I mean if you look back to the time, even before the internet, the CRAs have always operated at the intersection of credit risk analysis, target marketing, and product creation. So we worked with Chief Risk officers in the lending division, to understand the marketplace. And then to figure out whom they wanted to make offers to and the nature of those offers, we would then help them market the offers based on our authoritative terrestrial data. And those offers would show up, I think in pre internet, they show up in the consumers mailbox, the consumer, then, if they want to accept the offer, they initiate with a call to a call center, and an authentication experience, if you will, that back then was based on answering questions that came from knowledge of the consumers wallet, based on our credit information, and then with the acquisition of TLOxp we are adding public record information. So we've been at this intersection of these three domains for most of our existence. Now with the advent of the Internet, and the light in - to start reaching consumers on the web. We recognize there was a problem where outside of the walled gardens, a lot of transactions were anonymous. So we begin aggregating digital identifiers. And Neustar was one of the leading players in both aggregating that data, but also developing a technology platform, and a series of algorithms that help resolve identity on the fly, that could enable really accurate targeting, and fraud mitigation on the web, and we think that with the completion of this transaction, we've now got our business model covered in what is a hybrid era where look, while direct mail, in the like, in call centers, they may be declining as a percentage of total transactions, they are still growth full in fiber marketplaces, because they still work, there's still a return on those activities. So we've got to be able to serve that - serve to be able to bridge to the digital domain and be as effective there. So that's the industrial logic behind the transaction, I believe, with this combination, we're getting probably the best platform of its kind in the Neustar oneID platform. And the combination of data between the two enterprises is a really, really strong in leading offering in the marketplace. And then you're combining our marketing business, and their marketing business. And they're sophisticated tool sets for generating audiences. And for analyzing the mix of media to attain certain marketing return and the effectiveness of those activities, we've created a real scale critical mass player that cuts across both terrestrial marketing and digital marketing, and is positioned to really serve customers with a new level of effectiveness.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToniKaplan: Thank you. I wanted to ask about India, the growth there seems to be strong and recovering from some of the lockdowns that we've seen there. Can you just talk about the current state of India? And if you think the growth trajectory is fully back on track for that business?\nChrisCartwright: Yes, well, I'll start off and then, Todd, as the former international CFO has got some boots on the ground experience. But look, I think the India business is proving its resilience. I mean, we've seen, obviously, lending volumes and business robustness in general has been directly influenced by the intensity of the pandemic. And India has gone through and is recovering from a really intensive period, infection rate. And we all know that. And I think what you're seeing in this recovery in a prior recovery is just how growth full and resilient that market is. And that we've got a great and broad position there. We're not only the leading provider of consumer credit information, but we're also one of the leading providers of commercial credit information, and fraud mitigation in a whole range of services. So, India is exciting. I don't think India or any market within our portfolio is yet firing on all cylinders, right? We're still recovering, there are still headwinds. But look, I think our positions overall, in the 30 markets we serve are heavily weighted toward emerging and growth full, verticals end markets so.\nToddCello: And I just, Chris, I just add on to that, to just follow me back to the minority investment that we made in IDfy. So, for years TransUnion has built out our business in India, by exporting IP from other geographies that TransUnion operates in. And we've benefited from such capabilities as CreditVision, fraud, decisioning, and analytics. But now, we're starting to see the opportunity to make investments in strategic partnerships in this space. So we're excited about what you announced with IDfy which is a provider of video ID verification and authentication for onboarding. And this is the type of capability that has the potential to have the IP go back the other way, which is something that maybe it's in India today, but it's something that we could use in our other geographies. So we're really excited about the opportunity just to continue to bolster the capable of the assets that we have in India.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets.\nAshishSabadra: Thanks for taking my question. My question was just the changes in Apple' IDFA, and how that's affecting all the social media companies. I was just wondering if you can talk about how the Neustar acquisition, as well as the iovation and other strong identity products that you have, how does that position TransUnion for this changing environment? Thanks.\nToddCello: Hey, Ashish, can you repeat that? We had a little bit of a tech thing, or we didn't hear you well, we were scrambling to try to figure out what the exact question was. Could you ask it again, we want to make sure we get your question answered properly?\nAshishSabadra: Sure. Sorry about that. Yes, my question was the Apple IDFA changes that seem to be impacting the social media companies, because of how the identity gets resolved. And my question was with the acquisition of Neustar as well as the iovation and other identity solutions that you have; can you help advertisers address those issues? Or how is TransUnion positioned in this changing environment? Thank you.\nChrisCartwright: Yes, no, that - it is a great question. And it's one of the highest order questions of this industry. And look, this issue of identifying consumers on the web initially, it was solved by companies that focus their identity graphs around cookies. And as you have pointed out, whether it's Apple or Google or other players, with a push toward consumer privacy, the use of cookies by third parties on websites is diminishing, right? Making which is deteriorating performance of identity graphs that are anchored around the cookie. Now companies like Neustar and TransUnion design their solutions from the beginning to operate in the post cookie world, the way we resolve identity is based on multiple factors. Certainly, we have a large data set of cookies that is part of the solution. But we also have terrestrial information, cell phone information, URLs, device IDs, mobile Ad IDs, behavioral, a whole panoply of information, and a lot of real deep and thoughtful intelligence around the algorithms that resolve that information, frankly, in milliseconds, right to support personalized transactions in real time. So one of the reasons that we've doubled down in this space as we felt like the market was moving towards our broader identity resolution capabilities in that could be advantage\nOperator: The next question comes from George Tong of Goldman Sachs.\nGeorgeTong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Turning to the base business, you touched on relatively healthy consumer credit trends. Can you elaborate on bank card, auto and mortgage volume trends that you're currently seeing in factoring into your outlook?\nChrisCartwright: Well, let's say year-to-date and in third quarter, the performance of our financial services unit in the US is really strong. And it's substantially stronger if you control for the decline in mortgage, right. We've seen a surge in consumer lending activity and card activity as well. And even the auto business even though there are some constraints on supply is growth full and performing well. Now, in terms of a look forward, we've given you our guidance for the fourth quarter. And as you can see, it's not simply an improvement based on the overall performance in the third quarter, we're also assuming more robust environment. At this point, I don't think we're going - we're guiding for '22. I think that'll come in the early part of next year.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. That brings us to the conclusion of the call today. I know it's a very busy earnings day. We had a lot of news today. So we appreciate everybody's patience and perseverance working through all the news. It's an exciting day. So we know that you'll take the time to do that. And we thank you for spending the time with us this morning. Wish you all a great day today. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks Chris. Let me take you through our performance starting with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the third quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 14% on a reported basis and 13% in constant currency. The Signal and Tru Optik acquisitions had just under one point of impact, resulting in organic constant currency growth of 12%. Excluding mortgage which represented about 12% of total revenue over the past 12 months from both the third quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 17% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 21% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.3%, up 250 basis points, compared with the year ago quarter, driven primarily by the strong revenue performance. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 24%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing, prepayments and lower LIBOR. Now looking at segment financial performance, US markets revenue was up 14% compared to the year ago quarter, the two media acquisitions had about one point of impact on revenue, excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 21%. Adjusted EBITDA for US markets increased 19% on an as reported and on an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 175 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth, partially offset by our continued strategic and operational investments and the cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical; financial services revenue grew 11% and was up 31%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continued its strong rebound throughout the third quarter, as lenders across the space have aggressively stepped up their customer acquisition activity to catch your share of wallet for the historically strong consumer that Chris described. At the same time, investor funding is readily available and continues to be a strong driver of growth in this business. We also had a very strong quarter in our credit card business reflecting similar dynamics to consumer lending, as issuers proactively pursue incremental share of wallet. Much of this activity has been driven by the largest issuers and we continue to see regional players ramp up their activity levels, which should further propel this market in the quarters to come. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins helped offset a challenging environment for new and to a certain extent, used cars. While new vehicle inventory issues are well chronicle, they have a tag on effect with used cars as dealers see less trade and activity and shrinking supply that further exasperate the situation. With that said consumer demand remains high, giving us confidence that as inventory issues are resolved, volumes will return. And for mortgage for the full year, we now expect the market to be down slightly, but still near historically high levels. We had previously expected a flattish market. As we wrap up the year, rates remain lower than many anticipated, providing lift to the refi market and strengthen the purchase market despite continued inventory issues and correspondingly higher prices. Let me turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 17% on a reported basis and 14% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. We saw strong double digit growth in almost all our major verticals. Public sector delivered another very strong quarter driven by ongoing new business wins and opportunities created by changing policies and new programs from the Biden administration. Tenant and employment screening remain strong, though it has stabilized at a very high level. In tenant screening, we won meaningful new business, and our smart move platform continues to deliver strong growth. We expect employment screening to remain robust as the US continues to move toward fuller employment levels. And our media vertical continues to deliver strong double digit organic growth as we sign new accounts and see expanded usage with existing customers. Insurance also delivered another very good quarter on the strength of new business wins in 2020 and 2021, along with significant growth in our new products. Additionally, we are seeing the return of segments of consumer shopping activity that slowed considerably during the pandemic. Finally, our healthcare vertical revenue return to solid growth due to our successful sale efforts, augmented by improving front end volumes across all care settings. Volumes have slowly approached more normal levels and are starting to flow through to the back end of the business. With the market recovering our new bookings converting to revenue and back end volumes picking up the vertical is well positioned for a strong 2022. Consumer interactive revenue increased 3% as we grew in both the direct and indirect channels; adjusted EBITDA was up 4%. Our direct business continues to see a solid increase in our subscriber base with improving retention rates as consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Growth moderated from recent quarters, as we are now lapping very strong 2020 results. Our indirect channel grew again, as we continue to see strength with partners who provide identity protection for consumers. The acquisition of Sontiq will better position us in this fast growing part of the market as Chris discussed. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment revenue grew 18% as we saw trends improved in most of our regions, adjusted EBITA for international increased 31% as a result of the strong revenue growth, and particularly easy comparisons to the year ago quarter. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 16% as lending markets largely returned to normal levels, and we experienced continued strength in other markets like fraud, and online gaming and gambling. Last quarter, we mentioned a meaningful government contract that will be one time and extend over a number of quarters. Excluding that revenue, our UK business still would have grown about 9% in the quarter. Our Canadian business grew 4% in the third quarter, as we saw growth across our portfolio moderated by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter. Overall, lending markets soften in the quarter due to a slowing pace of mortgage origination and new vehicle supply challenges. Excluding the non-reoccurring breach business revenue would have grown about 6%. As we've noted on previous calls, our Canadian business has done an outstanding job securing a sizable amount of this type of business in recent years, however, is entirely unpredictable, and can be very lumpy. We can create year-over-year variances. Given the flow of breach wins in 2019 and 2020, I expect that we'll see more of this negative comparison in the next two quarters, barring new significant breach related business. In India, we grew 44%, reflecting a sharp improvement in consumer and lender activity as COVID cases have plummeted, and vaccination rates have increased significantly. This led to increasingly strong performance during the quarter, culminating with all-time high levels of inquiries, batch activity and commercial revenue. We also saw significant growth in fraud, direct-to-consumer and marketing solutions, reflecting broad strength across our diversified portfolio. Given the strength of the consumer and significant pent-up demand for consumption, we expect these trends to persist. In Latin America, revenue was up 22% as we grew in every market we serve, and importantly, realize double digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This strong growth reflects broad based market recovery and the benefits of a steady stream of new customer wins. In Asia Pacific, we grew 11% driven by positive momentum with our relaunched direct-to-consumer offering in Hong Kong and business wins with lending customers there. This strength was offset by ongoing significant market challenges in the Philippines, as the country has struggled to recover from the COVID related shutdowns. Finally, Africa increased 8% in our largest market, South Africa despite the challenges of third COVID wave and some civil unrest in July; the economy has begun to stabilize. And we continue to generate growth from CreditVision, commercial solutions and seamless onboarding for digital commerce. With the pending acquisitions of Neustar Sontiq along with the proceeds generated by selling our healthcare business, we intend to reenter the debt markets to fund the purchases. Based on our past experiences, we expect a robust market for our paper. The acquisitions of Neustar and Sontiq are approximately $3.7 billion in total. We intend to fund both acquisitions with incremental debt with the net proceeds from the healthcare business, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio will be about 3.8x on December 31, 2021 pro forma basis. And the $709 million of cash we've built up on our balance sheet gives us additional opportunity for future capital deployment, including additional M&A and/or debt prepayment. As this chart shows, we have a highly credible track record of rapidly delevering, driven by our strong cash flows, and our ability to significantly improve the adjusted EBITDA of the assets we acquire. Given our cost savings and revenue growth expectations for Neustar and Sontiq, along with the Healthcare proceeds, we have confidence that we can reduce our leverage ratio to about 3.3x by the end of 2022. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Other than the equity investments, none of the transactions we've discussed today have closed. So our guidance reflects the ongoing TransUnion without acquisitions, or the divestiture of the Healthcare business. Starting with fourth quarter revenue, we expect minimal impact from foreign exchange, and no impact from M&A. Revenue is expected to come in between $764 million and $774 million or a 9% to 11% increase on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate four point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 13% to 14%, excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $293 million and $301 million, an increase of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.88 and $0.91, an increase of 10% to 14%. And for the full year, we expect one point of tailwind to both revenue and adjusted EBITDA from foreign exchange. And we expect about one point of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.075 billion to $3.085 billion, up 13% to 14%. Our guidance includes two points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue excluding mortgage on an organic tax and currency basis is expected to increase 13% to 14%. For our business segments, we expect US markets, financial services, and emerging verticals, to each is up low double digits. Excluding the impact of mortgage, US markets would be up high teens and financial services would be up more than 20%. We anticipate that international will grow approximately 20% on an as reported bassist, and we expect consumer interactive to be up mid-single digits, benefiting from some one-time breach related business in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.239 billion and $1.247 billion, up 19%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 180 to 190 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.76 and $3.79, up 25% to 26%. At this time, we have no material updates to our other guidance items like tax rate, D&A, interest expense, and capital expenditures. They remain the same as what we provided on our year-end earnings call in February. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Yes, sure, Chris. Thanks. And good morning, Andrew, as far as mortgage is concerned on a trailing 12 month basis, about 12% of our revenue is coming from mortgage and it's down a little bit from where we were at the end of the second quarter when we said it was about 13%. Yes, sure. Hey, Gary, this is Todd. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Here's how we're thinking about implications of Neustar and Sontiq as well as Healthcare in 2022. Let me, first let me remind you of what we spoke about with Neustar back in the middle of September. So first, with Neustar, margin - from a margin perspective clearly a lower margin than TransUnion today, but we spoke about the expense energies that are they're clearly not buying the business for expense synergies, we're really excited about the top line growth. So if you take those two things kind of hand-in-hand, the business that today has got a 20% EBITDA margin, we have aspirations that over the next four to five years, it's going to scale to be something like TransUnion's margin today. However, in '22, it's a year of heavy lifting for us. So - act on our margin, from an earnings per share perspective, we did say that it would be slightly dilutive in 2022, but then accretive as we go forward, beyond, if you then turned to Sontiq, Sontiq as we covered this morning, we're expecting, if you look at the margin that's kind of implied in the numbers that we've put out there. It's already carrying margins similar to TransUnion's margins. So that will not be dilutive to the overall margin profile. From an EPS perspective, we're expecting it to be roughly about neutral in 2022. And then with growth thereafter. And then finally, Healthcare. As you can see, the numbers that we put out this morning for the size of the business, revenues about $190 million, and then mid 40% adjusted EBITDA margins, clearly that margin is higher than TransUnion's overall margin. So if you think about '22, it definitely will have a dilutive impact on the margin, as well as on earnings per share. So I would characterize '22, as a year, where we're going to integrate these acquisitions. And I think the most important thing is these are investments for the future of TransUnion to sustain the top line growth that we've enjoyed since our IPO, and that's the spirit behind everything, that we're doing here to reposition the portfolio towards attractive traders for growth. And when we'll have an Investor Day more than likely in first quarter of '22. So we'll get into all the details at that event. Yes, thanks, Chris. So as I showed in the slides, you can see the leverage ratio that we're anticipating, so just to kind of go back and reiterate on that, if you looked at all of 2021. And on a pro forma basis, you layer in Neustar, Sontiq and subtract out the Healthcare business leverage ratio would be at 3.8x, and we've publicly said for a number of years, that our target leverage ratio is about 3.5x. So we're just slightly ahead of that. But as we also shown in our prepared materials, we're expecting that for full year 2022 that the leverage ratio will tick down to 3.3x. So the characteristics of TransUnion business model are full on display, with these acquisitions, as well because of the margins, free cash flows that businesses generate, ultimately, increased capacity that as well to gives us the confidence that we'll be able to delever. So with that being said, the ability to delever does create capacity for us on an M&A perspective. So, as Chris said, no, we're going to continue to look, the market is attractive right now, and but there's clearly a lot ahead of us from an integration perspective that we want to make certain that we execute flawlessly. Yes. As far as Healthcare's growth rate, I think what's important to point out here is that vertical turn to growth in the third quarter, obviously impacted by the pandemic over the last several quarters. And that's the growth rate that we experienced in certain quarters mid-single digits. And I'll just add on to that, from a financial point of view, obviously, we put the numbers out, you see the revenue, we said, 190, approximately, in 2021 with a mid 40% adjusted EBITDA margin, I would say, I would characterize the business as one that persevered throughout the pandemic, and it was more of an issue of an impact on patient volumes during that time, and what we found is that there was absolutely nothing structural that changed. And so now what we're experiencing is volumes now returning back to more normal levels, the business is now getting back to that mid single digit growth that we were expecting, and the case in point is the performance that we just saw in the third quarter, so and Chris articulated the strategic rationale for it. So - got it. And I just, Chris, I just add on to that, to just follow me back to the minority investment that we made in IDfy. So, for years TransUnion has built out our business in India, by exporting IP from other geographies that TransUnion operates in. And we've benefited from such capabilities as CreditVision, fraud, decisioning, and analytics. But now, we're starting to see the opportunity to make investments in strategic partnerships in this space. So we're excited about what you announced with IDfy which is a provider of video ID verification and authentication for onboarding. And this is the type of capability that has the potential to have the IP go back the other way, which is something that maybe it's in India today, but it's something that we could use in our other geographies. So we're really excited about the opportunity just to continue to bolster the capable of the assets that we have in India. Hey, Ashish, can you repeat that? We had a little bit of a tech thing, or we didn't hear you well, we were scrambling to try to figure out what the exact question was. Could you ask it again, we want to make sure we get your question answered properly?"

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll discuss the resilience of our markets along with some of the broad macro trends that we experienced in the third quarter. I'll also update you on our strong underlying business performance that reflects our ability to execute the growth playbook that I've outlined on previous calls. Next, I will discuss our strategic ambitions, and how our recently announced acquisitions and divestitures support them. We continue to build off a strong foundation in identity resolution that's applied broadly across our various solutions and all of our end market. This capitalizes on our strengths as a credit bureau as we extend and scale our marketing risk authentication and fraud solutions to enable better consumer experiences in a digital environment. As part of this discussion, I'll offer some additional comments about our recently announced acquisition of Neustar. I'll also provide color on today's announced acquisition of Sontiq, a highly complementary business that empowers consumers with identity protection solutions. I'll also touch on two attractive equity investments we made in financial technology firms in the UK and India. Each furthers our consumer identity focus strategy. And at the same time, our decision to divest TransUnion Healthcare both helps to fund these attractive acquisitions, and to sharpen our focus on our core markets and capabilities. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our third quarter results in detail, along with fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Let me start with the third quarter. We posted very strong results as most of our markets continued to rebound and our growth outpaced underlying market recovery on the strength of our growth playbook, namely, new business wins, a steady stream of new product innovation and success in attractive adjacent markets. In the US, we've never seen a healthier consumer balance sheet driving consumer spending above pre COVID levels in spurring more aggressive marketing by our customers. We expect us to drive further upside in most of our US businesses, particularly consumer lending, credit card and employment screening. At the same time, we continue to see a phased recovery across our international markets, and notably did not see any meaningful COVID related setback in our major markets during the quarter. Despite another quarter of robust performance, we expect to see significant further recovery over the next several quarters in emerging markets, such as India, the Philippines, South Africa and much of Latin America. Importantly, beyond market based recovery, we continue to deliver growth above our underlying markets, reflecting a combination of market recovery and organic growth. Given our strong third quarter and increasingly positive macro environment, we've raised our full year 2021 guidance again, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high single digit revenue growth at an expanding attractive margin with double digit EPS growth. We believe our strategic evolution to further support consumers and customers in an ecommerce environment provides the next chapter of our growth story. With that point today, I want to talk about our focus on improving identity verification, and targeting precision to enable safe, tailored consumer experiences as we feel attractive white spaces created by a more digitized economy in building off of our legacy capabilities as a credit bureau. For decades, the national credit bureaus have operated at the intersection of credit analysis, marketing, and fraud mitigation. We engage with the risk management arm of a consumer lender to help them understand the broader credit market. We then help them develop the audience that they want to reach through our batch pre-screened services. Traditionally, that offer would arrive via direct mail, relying on our header information built on broad and authoritative terrestrial data. If the consumer response to the offer, they didn't contact the call center to activate it. And during that process, they're authenticated using knowledge based questions likely derived from our credit information or public records data. TransUnion sits at the center of all three dimensions of this activity, credit analysis, target marketing and fraud mitigation. With a growth in ecommerce, we began to evolve our strategy to incorporate digital identity. How can we combine still valuable PII with new identifiers, such as email addresses, cell numbers, device IDs, advertising IDs, geolocation data, URLs, and cookies, the acquisitions of TLO and iovation with its comprehensive digital device data laid a valuable foundation that we augmented with the later purchases of TruSignal, Signal, and Tru Optik to build out our marketing capabilities. Each of these investments furthered our ability to accurately link and match data to consumers. What we would now call our identity graph, both offline and online data, helping our clients enrich their customer intelligence with the digital information necessary to target consumers across media channels. For marketers, for instance, this solves a fundamental problem that outside of the walled gardens, less than half of the time, businesses don't know exactly who they're interacting with on the so called open web. With our digital identifiers, and modern technology stack, we can help answer the question who am I dealing with in a digital environment. And with that knowledge, our customers can ensure that the right customers are receiving the right offers with minimal friction or in the case of bad actors putting up the necessary barriers to prevent fraud. Now with that as a backdrop, the pending acquisition of Neustar significantly enhances our identity resolution capabilities for a variety of online applications. As a reminder, we expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approval. Neustar provides real time identity resolution through its oneID platform, powering solutions that serve three attractive markets, marketing, online fraud mitigation, and communications. Now we've talked about the power of bringing these capabilities together with TransUnion. Bolstering our already strong identity resolution capabilities, and accurate authoritative PII, generating incremental scale and scope in the three complementary markets that Neustar serves. As we expand in these high growths, non-credit markets, we further diversify our portfolio, which contributes to our ability to consistently outperform our underlying markets. Additionally, the complementary capabilities and data enabled innovation and cross-selling that further fuels our ability to deliver above market growth. Finally, we're particularly excited about the influx of strong and relevant talent, including in high impact areas like data science, engineering and sales. With considerable strength in developing solutions, we see a great fit with our highly evolved vertical market strategy. And as a result of the substantial benefits, we expect our long-term growth rate will accelerate over time. Now, let's step back for a moment and talk about the journey that Neustar has been on in recent years. They have evolved into a very different company today than the one that many people knew before they were taken private, in 2017. And frankly, as we look at Neustar today, we believe that they've gone through a similar transformation as TransUnion and today are at both a growth and financial inflection point. Neustar new leadership and PE owners made broad meaningful improvements in the business. They implemented organizational leadership, cultural, strategic, and operational changes to position the company for long-term growth. These include new leadership and key functions, investment and sales, account management, and product development, along with data science, and marketing talent and processes, implementation of a cloud based and scalable product and technology stack, and fully realizing the vision of the oneID identity resolution platform. So let me spend a minute on the power of oneID, which is a modern, cloud native AI enabled connected platform that solves the complex problem of resolving multiple identity signals into single individuals or households. OneID today uses proprietary data and analytic capabilities to deliver market leading identity resolution accuracy, across disparate online and offline signals. With signal strength, generating insight, from high volume observable events, and the breadth and depth of scale the market requirements requires rather, as part of its oneID centric strategy Neustar made new product investments, leveraging oneID and proprietary Decision Analytics to drive differentiated value propositions and marketing fraud in communications, and organic growth initiatives have been complemented by tuck-in acquisitions to broaden and strengthen their solutions. As Neustar sits at the inflection point, between significant investment and growth acceleration, we see a long path of opportunities to drive incremental revenues. We think about this in three waves. Initially, cross-selling, then innovating from the combined data and technology assets, and longer term taking the oneID platform and related marketing fraud and data management solutions across our global markets. In the first phase as an example, Neustar had success with very large financial services customers, but less so with mid market lenders where TransUnion has considerable sales coverage in strength. Our teams will begin to sell a number of Neustar solutions to the mid market accounts quickly after we close the transaction. And it's a similar story in the insurance and other verticals. On the other hand, Neustar has a well-established foothold in markets such as technology, retail, ecommerce and telecommunications, where we've been growing and building a presence, but lack the kind of scale and strong relationships with C-suite decision makers than Neustar has. This opens the door to cross sell TransUnion solutions to these customers. In the second wave, we envision developing new solutions built on our combined data asset, assets that leverage the strength of oneID to enhance our industry leading innovation. That might include leveraging data analytics from Neustar to better develop a household view for our insurance customers or to develop a closed loop marketing solution. And in the third wave, we will extend oneID to our international markets. The oneID platform has cleared global applications that were part of Neustar's long-term strategy by combining their best-in-class technology with our data assets and customer relationships around the globe; we will position ourselves to deliver superior identity resolution in our local markets, allowing us to drive incremental growth. I'd also like to spend a moment discussing marketing solutions. You have heard us talk a lot about our opportunity in fraud space in the past, but not as much about what we can do in marketing by leveraging the same identity resolution capabilities that we do in fraud. Neustar provides identity based solutions that enable marketers to better understand their consumers, message to them effectively and orchestrate personalized experiences across channels and optimize the effectiveness of their marketing investments. We have no interest in becoming an ad tech company or a measurement currency. Rather, we aspire to deliver best-in-class data and analytics to help our customers make better decisions, just as we do in other parts of our business. Combining TransUnion and Neustar capabilities creates an identity precision targeting and marketing performance optimization suite required to operate in a world without cookies or device ID. With Neustar, we have the opportunity to become the leading marketing centered identity solutions provider that enables personalized marketing, and can measure its effectiveness. As with the entirety of our business, this is a data centric solution, where we have broad authoritative data now combined with best-in-class technology and analytics to make that data actionable. We have great conviction that our proposed investment in Neustar will significantly advance our ambitions in this large and quickly evolving space. Let me move to another transformational growth opportunity. Today, we also announced our intent to acquire Sontiq for $638 million, and we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Leveraging a cloud based technology infrastructure, Sontiq provides solutions to help consumers and businesses protect against identity theft and cybercrime, including identity monitoring, restoration, and breach response products and services. The current owners executed a smart roll up strategy beginning in 2017, to bring together complementary assets to provide identity protection solutions. Today, they serve a broad range of customers primarily in employee benefits, insurance financial services in the public sector. The acquisition is attractive for three primary reasons. First, ID protection is an attractive, fast growing market driven by the rapid evolution of online commerce that I've already discussed. In this environment, consumers have a heightened awareness of a concern about the risks of identity theft. However, many of them are reluctant to enroll in a service that's not supported by a trusted brand like TransUnion. We've seen the impact of this market demand in our consumer inactive business over the past several years. And Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market fueling stronger growth long term. Second, the acquisition fits nicely with our ongoing evolution to provide data driven identity solutions for consumers and customers as they more frequently interact and transact online. Four our consumer interactive business that entails empowering consumers by helping them understand their credit profile, improve their access to goods and services, advance their financial standing, and protect the financial profile that they build. Sontiq helps us transition from a credit data provider to a full solutions provider combining core credit monitoring with sophisticated identity protection, augmenting both our direct and indirect businesses. It provides us access to new attractive end markets like employee benefits, and expanding our position in current markets such as insurance. And Sontiq provides incremental capabilities such as dark web monitoring, transaction and child monitoring and proprietary capabilities for breach risk assessment. Finally, in addition to being a strong strategic fit that will enable growth, the business already has an attractive financial profile with $85 million of estimated revenue in 2021, at a roughly 40% margin, we expect the transaction to be neutral to adjusted EPS in 2022 and accretive after that. We expect the business to grow in the low double digits in the future on the strength of the underlying digital identity protection market, and the benefits of combining with TransUnion. So, like Neustar, we expect Sontiq to accelerate our long-term revenue growth. And let me wrap up with a brief discussion of some attractive equity investments that we made recently. The first Monevo extends further our presence in the fast growing online lending market, and again advances our ability to support customers and consumers in the rapid transition to ecommerce that I described earlier. Monevo delivers pre-qualification services to lenders, and price comparison websites, mainly in the UK and US to support consumer access to finance. This enables consumers to easily shop for credit products by obtaining multiple pre-qualified credit quotes that don't adversely affect their credit score. We also made an investment in an established commercial relationship with IDfy, an Indian provider of video based ID verification, authentication, and onboarding solutions. This partnership will enable TransUnion to offer expanded digital onboarding and verification technologies to its global customer base, including enriched video based Know Your Customer Identification. This investment also supports our agenda to capitalize on key ecommerce trends globally. And as we announced this morning, we've agreed to sell TransUnion Healthcare to nThrive backed by Clearlake Capital Group for $1.735 billion, which we believe will result in about $1.4 billion in after tax proceeds at the current tax rates. These proceeds will help fund a significant portion of the cost to acquire Neustar and Sontiq. This portfolio transformation reflects our clear focus on the best long term growth opportunities for TransUnion that I've just highlighted. And for TransUnion Healthcare, this outstanding business will benefit from being part of a pure play healthcare data and analytics business. We're targeting a fourth quarter close pending regulatory reviews. And for the TransUnion Healthcare employees, I want to extend our gratitude for all of your contributions to TransUnion over the years, as you build your fine business; we believe that TransUnion will benefit from this combination. Now let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our third quarter financial results, and our fourth quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Over to you, Todd. Thanks Todd. To conclude this morning, we took you through a strong third quarter that highlights the resilience of our markets and our ability to effectively execute our growth playbook. And as our outlook for the year has further improved, we raised our outlook for the full year for the third consecutive quarter. We also highlighted our ongoing strategic pivot to deliver solutions for consumers and our customers in a rapidly evolving online environment. The Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions will play a critical role in advancing the strategy and will deliver compelling financial performance. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I will turn the time back to Aaron. Yes, so good morning, Andrew. This is Chris. And the audio faded a little bit, but I believe you asked two questions. The first is kind of the revenue mix across Sontiq which we discuss, and then also the performance of mortgage and the total of mortgage in the third quarter, right? Yes, let me jump into Sontiq. So the mix of revenues roughly about 25% of their revenues, are direct-to-consumer little bit more than that. Close to 20% is a direct sale to the insurance industry, where their solutions are bundled with personal and commercial policies. Direct sale into employee benefits, both to corporations directly and through brokers is another 20%. And then about 34%, 35% is into financial services, right. So it's a fairly broad mix. We like it because it gives us some additional channels for the combined suite of solutions with TU bringing credit and credit monitoring and education and like and some focused on the protection. And then Todd, why don't you handle the mortgage question? Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. So I mean, I think you've touched on a couple of important points. At the core, we're extending the value proposition of what we can do for consumers, whether we reach them directly through our own marketing efforts and our own website, or through indirectly through different platform providers. And, look, we've had a relationship with other players where we could provide this on a partnership basis. We felt like we were missing an opportunity to develop this broader integrated suite in our arsenal and that's really Sontiq comes in. Also Sontiq has multiple channels as I just answered, but also direct-to-consumer presence and we can augment that with the full complement of our credit information. And yes, look, it's not a complete coincidence that we've acquired Neustar which is a leading provider of identity information and resolution capabilities, to help businesses target their consumers and also to protect transactions. And then now we've got this fraud and identity plays with Sontiq. I think there is some opportunity for innovation between those two positions. We also are the only bureau that owns a complete Public Records Archive and investigative solutions in the US. And again, that also gives us compelling content to engage consumers, and help them understand other dimensions of their data identity if you will and the ability to review and to correct an action. So I feel like, look, this just adds not only audience but a lot of capabilities for us to be creative with. Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew, what a difference a quarter makes right. Second quarter, we got a lot of questions about the degree to which we deleveraged and toward debt ratio of 2x EBITDA by the end of year, and even some questions about whether we were going to increase the dividend, all a great thing to do. But as we said then, we were active in M&A discussions that advanced our strategy, and broaden our value proposition to the markets that we serve. We've now executed on a few of these, including the divestiture of our Healthcare business, which was designed in part to free capital to pay for these portfolio management moves that we've been making, but also to liberate the business and combine it with an asset that can help accelerate its growth, right. So I think it's exciting on a couple of levels. There's a lot going on in the M&A market, obviously, we've made some big moves here. And these are moves designed to drive nation, ultimately growth. And so we've got to digest them, and apply our talent and our innovation capacity to getting the most out of these acquisitions, because each one is very synergistic with a core position we have, and it's really a bet that these moves, one plus one can be more than two, right. And we believe that is the case. That said, we don't like never say never, and we're open to other moves that would advance the strategy. But we have to be mindful, of course of our balance sheet and not taking on too much debt. And also our ability to digest all of this. So we execute effectively. And then I think I'll pass it over to Todd, to talk a bit more about our thinking on debt. Yes, well, let me start with the competitive landscape for Sontiq. And then I'll hand it over to Todd, for the financial question on healthcare. Look, it's many of the players that you know already, I mean, we consider certainly Experian and Equifax have offerings in this marketplace, and bring broad suite of solutions. One of the large insurers all state has InfoArmor; there's also Identity Guard, NortonLifeLock which is a direct-to-consumer play, that certainly has a comparable suite of functionality. But with amalgam we're going to bring, I think we meet the mark of the market terms, the breadth and dimension and the offering. And then we also have some kind of some unique benefits. So obviously, credit scores and reports and a simulator. And then one and multi bureau monitoring as part of the core package, as well as monitoring the dark web, looking at transaction monitoring through bank relationships, reputation and social monitoring. And in the event of a negative occurrence, we can restore the consumers' identity, as well as pursues reimbursement of stolen funds. So we really deepened our product offering here in the direct-to-consumer business, and that's going to benefit us both in the direct market and in the indirect space. Todd on Healthcare? Sure, well, we'll unpack the question, starting first with the strategic rationale for divesting Healthcare. And look, our position has been for a long time that Healthcare, both accelerated our growth, but also provided some portfolio diversification. And so we like the business and we invested in internal innovation and acquisition to grow it. However, as we've looked at the overall macro dynamics in the healthcare market over these past several years, there's a real push toward consolidation and building scale, both on the provider side, and actual healthcare providers themselves, the hospital systems, medical systems and the like. And also on the healthcare provider space, right. And so we felt like, we needed to gain scale and breadth in our offering to the marketplace in order to fully compete. But then we had a whole variety of other growth and innovation ideas. And frankly, not the balance sheet to fund it, all right, nor the pure focus on the healthcare space, that a dedicated player like nThrive backed by Clearlake can provide when the nThrive business was marketed a couple of years ago, we looked at it hard. And ultimately, we decided that given other growth ideas that we had, we needed to pass on it. But at that point, we realized that it was time to liberate this Healthcare asset that we bought, and find a really good strategic partner to combine it with. We think that the fit between nThrive and TransUnion Healthcare business is extremely complimentary. It gives us very nice and complete but not overlapping positions in the front and middle and back end of revenue cycle management. We're also excited that we're going to have a continuing business relationship with this new combined healthcare entity where we can provide them with data and analytic services to help them completely serve that are their healthcare customers. So that was, look, that was the rationale. It's bittersweet, because Healthcare has been a terrific diversification investment for TransUnion. But, we wanted to build scale, and really focus our portfolio on a collection of assets that made a lot of sense together, and were very synergistic, but could also be taken across all of the markets in which we compete around the world. Now, as synergies, yes, absolutely. There are some synergies; we're going to have an ample transition services agreement, as the new acquirer integrates our Healthcare business onto their platform. And look, over time, we'll unwind any dis-synergies, which we think are fairly minor. Yes, sure. So listen, focused on what we're doing with Neustar today, and the combination of our assets. I guess at the most basic and strategic level to deal with Neustar helps us fully translate our traditional business model into the digital world. And I mean if you look back to the time, even before the internet, the CRAs have always operated at the intersection of credit risk analysis, target marketing, and product creation. So we worked with Chief Risk officers in the lending division, to understand the marketplace. And then to figure out whom they wanted to make offers to and the nature of those offers, we would then help them market the offers based on our authoritative terrestrial data. And those offers would show up, I think in pre internet, they show up in the consumers mailbox, the consumer, then, if they want to accept the offer, they initiate with a call to a call center, and an authentication experience, if you will, that back then was based on answering questions that came from knowledge of the consumers wallet, based on our credit information, and then with the acquisition of TLOxp we are adding public record information. So we've been at this intersection of these three domains for most of our existence. Now with the advent of the Internet, and the light in - to start reaching consumers on the web. We recognize there was a problem where outside of the walled gardens, a lot of transactions were anonymous. So we begin aggregating digital identifiers. And Neustar was one of the leading players in both aggregating that data, but also developing a technology platform, and a series of algorithms that help resolve identity on the fly, that could enable really accurate targeting, and fraud mitigation on the web, and we think that with the completion of this transaction, we've now got our business model covered in what is a hybrid era where look, while direct mail, in the like, in call centers, they may be declining as a percentage of total transactions, they are still growth full in fiber marketplaces, because they still work, there's still a return on those activities. So we've got to be able to serve that - serve to be able to bridge to the digital domain and be as effective there. So that's the industrial logic behind the transaction, I believe, with this combination, we're getting probably the best platform of its kind in the Neustar oneID platform. And the combination of data between the two enterprises is a really, really strong in leading offering in the marketplace. And then you're combining our marketing business, and their marketing business. And they're sophisticated tool sets for generating audiences. And for analyzing the mix of media to attain certain marketing return and the effectiveness of those activities, we've created a real scale critical mass player that cuts across both terrestrial marketing and digital marketing, and is positioned to really serve customers with a new level of effectiveness. Yes, well, I'll start off and then, Todd, as the former international CFO has got some boots on the ground experience. But look, I think the India business is proving its resilience. I mean, we've seen, obviously, lending volumes and business robustness in general has been directly influenced by the intensity of the pandemic. And India has gone through and is recovering from a really intensive period, infection rate. And we all know that. And I think what you're seeing in this recovery in a prior recovery is just how growth full and resilient that market is. And that we've got a great and broad position there. We're not only the leading provider of consumer credit information, but we're also one of the leading providers of commercial credit information, and fraud mitigation in a whole range of services. So, India is exciting. I don't think India or any market within our portfolio is yet firing on all cylinders, right? We're still recovering, there are still headwinds. But look, I think our positions overall, in the 30 markets we serve are heavily weighted toward emerging and growth full, verticals end markets so. Yes, no, that - it is a great question. And it's one of the highest order questions of this industry. And look, this issue of identifying consumers on the web initially, it was solved by companies that focus their identity graphs around cookies. And as you have pointed out, whether it's Apple or Google or other players, with a push toward consumer privacy, the use of cookies by third parties on websites is diminishing, right? Making which is deteriorating performance of identity graphs that are anchored around the cookie. Now companies like Neustar and TransUnion design their solutions from the beginning to operate in the post cookie world, the way we resolve identity is based on multiple factors. Certainly, we have a large data set of cookies that is part of the solution. But we also have terrestrial information, cell phone information, URLs, device IDs, mobile Ad IDs, behavioral, a whole panoply of information, and a lot of real deep and thoughtful intelligence around the algorithms that resolve that information, frankly, in milliseconds, right to support personalized transactions in real time. So one of the reasons that we've doubled down in this space as we felt like the market was moving towards our broader identity resolution capabilities in that could be advantage Well, let's say year-to-date and in third quarter, the performance of our financial services unit in the US is really strong. And it's substantially stronger if you control for the decline in mortgage, right. We've seen a surge in consumer lending activity and card activity as well. And even the auto business even though there are some constraints on supply is growth full and performing well. Now, in terms of a look forward, we've given you our guidance for the fourth quarter. And as you can see, it's not simply an improvement based on the overall performance in the third quarter, we're also assuming more robust environment. At this point, I don't think we're going - we're guiding for '22. I think that'll come in the early part of next year."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Hope that all of you remain safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent form 10-K, form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. With that out of the way, my pleasure to turn things over to Chris Cartwright.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy and beginning to enjoy a return to more normal activity in your life. At TransUnion, while our associates continue to largely work from home, we have begun to slowly reenter the workplace in a thoughtful and safe fashion. We've started to conduct small in-person meetings in our offices. In fact, Todd, Aaron, and I are together in-person today for the first time in almost a year and a half. In the U.S., we currently plan to gradually return to in-office work in the fall. Though with significant flexibility to capitalize on the benefits, many employees enjoy working from home. Now, I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will discuss some of the broad macro and TransUnion specific trends that we experienced in the second quarter as well as highlight some recent progress related to social justice issues and other areas where we can make a difference as an organization. Next, in the context of our unique market positions and approach, I will discuss two growth areas; consumer lending and the public sector, to illustrate several dimensions of this approach that have consistently resulted in outsized long-term organic growth. Finally I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our second quarter results in detail along with third quarter and full-year 2021 guidance. So, let me start with our second quarter performance. We posted very strong results as markets generally continue to rebound and our growth outpaced underlying market recovery on the strength of new business wins and a steady stream of new product innovation. Todd will discuss some of the specific revenue trends later as part of his remarks. In the U.S. where consumer spending has surged ahead of pre-COVID levels and consumers have substantial capacity to borrow, the recovery appears to be in full swing, although not yet complete. We expect additional recovery-driven upside in most of our U.S. businesses, particularly consumer lending, employment screening, collections and healthcare. At the same time, we believe that recovery in our international markets has only begun despite very impressive growth this quarter. In emerging markets like India, the Philippines, South Africa and much of Latin America, we see considerable upside as those markets improve over the next 6 to 12 months. Importantly, beyond market-based recovery we continue to deliver growth above our underlying markets. Todd will lay this out in greater detail, but you'll see that our multiyear growth stack in the second quarter clearly shows that the strong results we posted represent a combination of market recovery and organic growth. For instance, in the second quarter of the U.S., CreditVision and CreditVision Link grew almost 50%, well ahead of our strong financial services growth, reflecting the significant win that we've discussed in previous quarters. On our insurance vertical, which grew more than 20% in the quarter. We outpaced industry recovery on the strength of share gains and deeper penetration within our customers. More on our tenant and employment screening vertical where our focus on leveraging strategic tenant and screening partners have paid off and helped to deliver 30% growth in the quarter. We see the same sort of outperformance in our international markets driven by meaningful wins in every region, including new insurance and FinTech customers in Canada, new business with the U.K. government, strong CreditVision performance in South Africa, and new business with key lending customers in India. Given our strong second quarter and the increasingly positive macro environment, we have raised our full-year 2021 guidance again. Todd will provide you with the details shortly. Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high-single digit revenue growth at an expanding attractive margin with double-digit EPS spread. We also remain focused on how we conduct business and the positive impact we can have on our associates, our communities, and all of our stakeholders. To that end, we've increased our disclosure and established meaningful targets for workforce diversity and similar strategic imperatives to improve our business. For instance, during the quarter, we implemented a global supplier diversity procurement process. Also during the second quarter, a well-regarded third-party completed a global assessment of our energy and carbon footprint. We\u2019ve provided the 2019 and 2020 baseline data on our website. Using this data, we will develop appropriate targets to reduce our environmental impact. We also launched a thorough materiality assessment to refresh our understanding of key stakeholders\u2019 views about TransUnion. This will further inform our future disclosure and target setting. So, now I\u2019ll pivot to discuss our long-term growth priorities. On our last call, I spent some time delineating TransUnion\u2019s differentiated market-positioning approach which fuels our long-term growth algorithm. Let me quickly review each of these differentiators. First, we've taken an innovator and attacker position across our markets and built a track record of delivering outsized unit growth across markets we serve by disrupting - through disruption and market share gains. In addition to our attractive market position, we have a proven scalable enterprise growth playbook. Based on the foundation of customer and consumer insights, we've developed a repeatable approach to client engagement, product innovation and adjacency expansion. We complement the growth playbook with powerful proprietary and third-party data assets. In addition to our traditional attractive position in consumer credit data, we have developed an array of alternative data assets to serve core in high-growth use cases. Next, our industry-leading technology remains a competitive advantage. I've regularly discussed our proven track record of delivering on large scale complex technology initiatives as well as Project Rise, our current program to make TransUnion\u2019s technology more scalable, secure, efficient and effective, and to keep us on the cutting edge of cloud computing and information security. And finally, underpinning these market positions, our culture emphasizes customer focus and partnership. We've built a company that understands the needs of customers and consumers and can deliver best-in-class solutions to meet those needs. We also balance the sense of humility with a deep inner drive to be successful and accountable while also taking a collaborative approach both internally and externally. So with that review as a backdrop, I want to provide a deep dive on two growth vectors, consumer lending and our public sector vertical. Now, candidly, we could have chosen for many other vertical solutions or geographic markets. We chose these two as a - to industry how we take an attacker position in attractive markets, also how we utilize the go-to-market approach in our growth playbook, and how we leverage data assets across the company. So let's start off with consumer lending which includes a number of lending in markets such as FinTech, short-term lending, point-of-sale, and buy now pay later. Our total consumer lending business has generated about $200 million of annual revenue in recent years, running above that mark in 2019 and dipping below in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic. Given our current trajectory, we expect to set a new high watermark above $200 million this year. FinTech represents the largest portion of the consumer business at about 50% of revenue followed by short-term lending at about 25% of revenue. Point-of-sale and now buy now pay later lending, while growing quickly, account for a low-single digit percentage of the consumer lending business. For my discussion today, I'm going to focus primarily on the FinTech portion of the business given its size and growth characteristics. From 2017 through 2019, FinTech revenue increased about 55% and then declined in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. We expect to see another significant leg of growth this year as the market rebounds and we benefit from recent share gains. TransUnion has a strategy of looking for the next major innovation in financial services, and we stay close to industry participants as well as venture capitalists to develop our viewpoint. More than a decade ago, we identified the burgeoning FinTech market as a significant opportunity. We developed a strategy that continues to this day, to engage early-stage FinTechs, partner to go to market quickly with TransUnion-enabled risk, fraud, and marketing solutions, and then support their expansion with thought leadership, industry expertise, and innovation. To formalize this approach, we created a FinTech startup kit making it as easy as possible for new players to enter the market using our data, our models and our expertise. As winners emerge, we\u2019ve positioned ourselves as their primary and frequently exclusive bureau partner. And that leadership position continues today as we remain the primary partner to the majority of FinTech lenders. As we help enable the growth of the industry, we learned from our partners, allowing us to refine our strategy and solidify our leadership with new and existing customers. We now have a formal FinTech advisory board that has played a key role in new product development either by existing ideas or helping us to define our own. For example, based on input from our advisory board members, we developed a number of prescreen and prequalification solutions to enable FinTechs as well as our core financial services customers to provide more relevant credit offers to more consumers with increased convenience. Going back five years and based on feedback from our advisory board, we created our innovation lab to bring customers onsite for an immersive process to solve a specific problem or develop a new model leveraging the full range of our data capabilities and expertise at TransUnion, all enabled by our 2016 Technology Transformation Project Spark, since we've had tremendous success using Innovation Lab to deepen and strengthen customer relationships with FinTech lenders as well as our core financial services partners and have expanded recently to engage with insurance customers. The other strong relationships are innovation, particularly credit vision and credit vision link has played an important role in solidifying our leadership position. Going forward, we have a significant opportunity to drive growth through greater penetration of fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer solutions. Our leadership position has also helped us develop a differentiated file as we see such a high percentage of consumer imports. As you would expect, all three bureaus capture the trend line data when a lender issues a loan. However, only the bureau providing data for the application sees the inquiry. Given our broad coverage in this space, we see a disproportionate amount of the inquiries, which helps in two ways. First, customers can drive insights about consumer behavior if they see a pattern develop. And second, comprehensive inquiry data helps us identify loan stacking fraud and other key risk factors in a way that our competitors cannot match. As we look forward, despite our exceptional growth and strong share position, we expect considerable more growth in the future. First, as I mentioned earlier, we have meaningful opportunities to deepen our penetration with our customers in fraud mitigation, marketing, and direct-to-consumer initiatives. Second, FinTech players continue to diversify from mono-line lending into multi-line lending, and we advise many of them as they enter areas like car, auto, and mortgage. Third, broadly within consumer lending, while small today, we see buy now, pay later, and point-of-sale lending as attractive growth factors. We've taken the same approach with these lenders as we did with FinTechs in their earlier days and have enabled - and helped to enable their success. We started with fraud solutions, and it pivoted to more traditional credit offerings as we capture significant portions of their traffic just as we did with FinTech. In addition to these opportunities in the U.S., we also have a meaningful business internationally with substantial growth potential. Year to date, FinTech represents about 13% of total international segment revenue. But has accounted for roughly 25% of the segment\u2019s growth. The U.K. has the most developed international FinTech market and it accounts for almost 60% of our international FinTech revenue. The next largest markets include India and Canada, followed by Hong Kong, Brazil and Colombia. We also have nascent businesses in South Africa and the Philippines. Interestingly, FinTechs in these markets have a more diverse portfolio addressing opportunities to the shop and offer differentiated consumer experiences across not only traditional lending and buy now pay later, but also digital banking, payments and retail investing. This gives us the opportunity to address a more diverse set of FinTech sectors in international. In cross-sell, a broader range of offerings to this customers. Our ability to rapidly identify the most attractive FinTech segments in markets within our international footprint and to effectively deploy our innovations like CreditVision, TruValidate, and Innovation Lab in these markets has helped us to build strong share positions just as we have in the U.S. Taken together, our U.S. and international FinTech positions represent a significant and fast growing part of our portfolio and should drive meaningful growth above the total company and segment rates in the years to come. Now I'd like to turn to our public sector vertical, which we formalized in 2015 to build off of a fledgling position that we had built more incidentally than deliberately. At that time, we had less than $10 million of government-related revenue spread across a number of our businesses but with no clear owner or strategy. Now, taking our assets and capabilities, we had a clear way to participate in this large attractive market, and in 2015 began the process of building out public sector as a stand-alone vertical utilizing our proven growth approach. First, we hired a dedicated leader, Jonathan McDonald, with deep industry expertise and gave him full P&L responsibility. Jonathan built up his team with dedicated government specialists from 19 associates in 2016 to 52 today. This team identified and prioritized the best opportunities for TransUnion which led to a two-pronged go-to-market strategy. The first part entailed identifying partners who could provide immediate access to various public sector business, allowing us to build the foundation and establish our brand. The second part involves playing the long game of gaining authorization to participate in government procurement processes directly to win business at the federal state and local level. Five years later, we\u2019ve developed an impressive group of partners that help us access local state and federal opportunities and we\u2019ve position ourselves to win business directly with all levels of government including higher education. Now, along with developing a market strategy, the team identified our existing solutions that could most readily fit this market need. In fact, we've never had to build a new solution specifically for public sector. We see that as a real positive that we can readily repurpose the assets within TransUnion and leverage them within a new vertical. This improves speed to market and lends itself to a higher-margin outcome as we don't have significant build-out cost. Now, while we've entered a number of areas, three solutions have driven a preponderance of our growth in the public sector. First, we leveraged our suite of thought in identity solutions to allow agencies to authenticate consumers interacting through existing online channels. Unsurprisingly, we saw significant surge at both the state and federal levels during the pandemic and demand continues today. We also see further opportunity as the Biden administration launches new programs to provide support to various constituents. Second, we utilized our broad array of powerful data assets delivered as a portfolio review for insider threat monitoring. Using this solution, we can help agencies that provide high-level security clearance, continuously monitor their workforce, and for any indication of financial distress or criminal activity as either can indicate heightened risk of an employee being compromised. And third, we combined our collection\u2019s prioritization tools and our leading industry insights around right party contact data to help states efficiently pursue parents who have failed to pay or continue to avoid paying child support obligations. This allows our customers to allocate the limited resources in the most effective way to maximize recovery of child support. All of this good work has resulted in rapid growth and we will approach $50 million in revenue this year. As we look forward with the clear path in this vertical to topping over $100 million in revenue. The next leg of growth will continue to leverage the approach I've just described and that starts with further penetration across the customer base as we built our reputation and develop a track record of delivering high impact solutions. We have positioned ourselves to bid on and win larger contracts and to connect business with states as well as new agencies at the state and federal level. We\u2019ve also launched a professional services offering for our customers where our experts assist with integrating, onboarding and managing our solutions to ensure a quick and effective start to contracts as well as heightened customer satisfaction. And we've launched a supply chain risk solution, as many agencies worry about subcontractors or other vendors become a weak link in the security chain or smaller subcontractors going out of business. We've leveraged our market-leading linking and matching capabilities to develop solutions that support both national security and business continuity. And finally, we see an opportunity to help agencies that provide critical benefits to constituents, better market their availability to ensure that those in need of help receive it. To that end, we continue to explore leveraging the digital marketing capabilities that we've developed. So, the stories of consumer lending in the public sector illustrate two of the many growth vectors in TransUnion. And while they've realized exceptional growth, we have great conviction that they will continue to grow on a similar trajectory in the future, helping to fuel our long-term growth algorithm. And so with that, let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our financial results and our second quarter and full-year 2021 guidance. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thanks Chris. We knew entering the quarter that we would see our easiest comparisons of the year and thus, likely our strongest quarterly performance. As Chris discussed, that was the case at most of our businesses declined in the second quarter of 2020 as we all grappled with the most severe impacts of the pandemic. And as expected, almost all of our businesses posted very strong growth in this quarter as markets continue to recover. We continue to monetize these business wins across our portfolio, and we benefited from easy comparison. In order to help you appreciate the long-term trends and the above-market performance in the current quarter, I think it's instructive to look back at our growth in the second quarter of 2019 and 2020. Doing so helps make more sense out of the very large increases we posted across the business this quarter. To that end, this slide shows you how we performed in the second quarter of this year for the same quarter over the past two years. The conclusion is that we have delivered attractive growth above the underlying market including the outsized recovery this quarter. This holds true for almost every segment, vertical, and region. Now, let me take you through our performance starting with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all the comparisons I discuss today will be against the second quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 22% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency. The Signal and Tru Optik acquisition had just about one point of impact. So, organic constant currency growth was 19%. Excluding mortgage, which represented about 13% of total revenue in the second quarter from both the second quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 21% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% on a reported and 29% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.1%, up 290 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter driven primarily by the significant revenue outperformance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 46%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing, prepayment, and lower LIBOR, as well as a slightly lower adjusted tax rate of 23.2%. I also want to address one other item as it had a significant impact on our reported EPS what was backed out of our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS in the same way we accounted for the reserves that we previously booked. During the quarter, the United States Supreme Court reversed the circuit court opinion related to a class action suit called Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC. As the court reduced the size of the class by more than 75%, and remanded the matter back to the lower court for further proceedings, we reduced our reserves by $32.4 million. Now, looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets\u2019 revenue was up 20% compared to the year-ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had 2 points of impact on revenue. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 22%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 22% as reported and 24% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth, partially offset by our continued strategic and operational investments and the cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical, Financial Services revenue grew 22% and was up 35% excluding mortgage. Notably, consumer lending, auto and credit card each delivered very strong results. While mortgage slowed significantly on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending surged on the strength of historically strong credit applications and marketing activities, which disproportionately benefits TransUnion, given the strong leadership position Chris outlined. Lenders have aggressively stepped up their customer acquisition activity as consumer spending has increased. With that said, there are still more upside ahead once credit card balances return and debt consolidation becomes more attractive. Likewise, short-term lenders are just beginning to see significant recovery in buy now pay later and point of sale continuing to grow. We also had a very strong quarter in our credit card business, with similar customer behavior in FinTech lending resulting in a high watermark for applications and marketing activity. Notably, we recently saw a top five U.S. card issuer where TransUnion is a primary provider of credit services switched away from FICO scores and replace them with VantageScore. This one - this may set the stage for other lenders to follow suit. Other markets continue to be solid despite constrained new car inventory. We have benefited from meaningful demand recovery in the subprime segment since the beginning of the year, where TransUnion had a strong share position. We also continue to see strength in prequalification solutions as more consumers shift to digital commerce. And for mortgage for the full year, we continue to expect the market to be roughly flat Continuing to expect the market to be roughly flat, in flat with our previous view. However, with volatile rates and purchase market strain due to a lack of inventory and correspondingly higher prices, we continue to anticipate year-over-year declines in mortgage for the remainder of 2021. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals which grew 17% on a reported basis and 13% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. We saw strong double digit growth in almost all of our major verticals. Public sector, as Chris discussed in depth, remains a very strong growth sector for TransUnion and continuing to deliver outstanding growth even after an outstanding 2020. Even as most government operations continue business as usual, we also continue to identify new opportunities born from the pandemic and changing policies and new programs from the Biden administration. Added an employment screening was very strong particularly for tenant screening as we benefited from our expanded partnerships with large growing rental screening firms using our Smart Move solution. We also won a meaningful contract with a large partner to provide income and employment verification for rental screening. We expect employment screening to continue to pick up momentum as the U.S. returns to full employment levels. And our media vertical continues to deliver attractive growth even as we sign new accounts. One to note is our partnership with OpenAP, a consortium of Fox, NBC Universal and Viacom CBS. OpenAP aspires to build an industry standard ID that incorporates a broad range of streaming signals to help advertisers build targeted audiences and measure impact Tru Optik data underpins and enable this identifier, so we are well-positioned to grow with OpenAP and other media companies like Blockgraph Comscore, and MediaMath as they roll out their own identifiers and grow. We also saw insurance deliver a very strong quarter behind a brisk pace of business win for our expanded set of solutions such as DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, CreditVision, Prefill, and TruValidate. We are also starting to see traction on the digital marketing side, similar to what we're seeing in the financial services, and winning new business on the strength of our Tru Audience platform. And finally, our healthcare vertical, revenue was down slightly but we continue to see front-end volumes improved and monetized quickly. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, front-end volumes take three or four months to flow through to the back end of our business which is roughly twice the size of the front end. In the second quarter, we realized the highest level of new business wins in our history, setting us up to return to growth in the second half of the year and further positioning us for a good 2022 as the market more fully recovers. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 6% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% as we continue to increase marketing in the direct channel during the quarter. That marketing helped drive low-double digit revenue growth in our direct business and a solid increase in our subscriber base. Consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Our indirect channel returned to growth as lenders have increased their marketing activity and we continue strength with partners who provide identity protection for consumers. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 32% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 75% as a result of the strong revenue growth and particularly easy comparisons to the year ago quarter. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 20% as lending markets continue their march back to pre-COVID levels and strong growth persisted in other markets like fraud and online gaming and gambling. And of note, we won another meaningful but largely one-time contract with the U.K. government to help consumers re-engage in more normal work social activity. Our Canadian business grew 25% in the second quarter as lending market slowly recovered and the business benefited from considerable portfolio diversification in fast growing areas like insurance, fraud, direct-to-consumer and FinTech. During the quarter, we also benefited from some one-time breach remediation business as we have over the past several years. In India, we grew 54% despite the negative impact of lockdowns in April and May. We ended the first quarter with lending markets nearly back at pre-pandemic levels, but that was short lived as the lockdown refocused consumer attention from shopping and borrowing for their health and welfare. As the surge abated, we saw lending markets steadily recover in the second quarter, though, a significant upside likely to come over the remainder of the year. At the same time, our diversified portfolio continues to offer a buoyancy and a difficult environment. We continue to see strength in commercial credit scoring, government programs, and fraud mitigation. We also expanded our thought leadership series, TGIF or TransUnion Great Information Fridays, to include CFOs and CMOs for the first time, deepening our already strong customer relationships. We also partnered with Google to deliver a report that provides trends and insights on the increasing reliance of consumers on the Internet for purchasing credit products caused by the unprecedented rise in digital adoption. In Latin America, revenue was up 46% in the strength of double digit growth in our two largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. Many of the smaller countries in Central America have returned to growth, and we expect significant additional recovery in the quarters to come. In Asia Pacific, we grew 27% driven by continued recovery in our largest market, Hong Kong, as well as positive momentum with our re-launched direct-to-consumer offerings and business wins with lending customers. Finally, Africa increased 37%. In our largest market, South Africa, the economy has started to show signs of improvement with expectations for annual GDP raised to 4.3% despite the slow pace of vaccination. Our business has seen continued strength of CreditVision insurance-related solutions. One of the many strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $526 million of cash on the balance sheet. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continue to decline from 2.7 times at the end of the first quarter to 2.4 times at the end of June. With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a good position to continue to proactively pursue additional attractive investments, which remain an important part of our long-term growth strategy. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Starting with third quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik, as well as a 1.5 point tailwind to revenue from FX and we expect 1.5 points of benefit to adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue is expected to come in between $766 million and $777 million or a 10% to 12% increase and organic constant currency revenue growth is expected to be up 8% to 10%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate 4 point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 12% to 14% excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $301 million and $308 million, an increase of 12% to 14%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.91 and $0.93, an increase of 12% to 15%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and 1.5 point tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $3.034 billion to $3.059 billion, up 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes 1.5 to 2 points of headwinds from mortgage for the full year. To help with your modeling, we currently expect mortgage to be a 3 point headwind in the fourth quarter. For our business segments, we expect US markets, financial services and emerging verticals each be up low double-digits. Excluding the impact of mortgage, U.S. markets would be up mid-teens, financial services would be up high teens. We anticipate that international will grow more than 20% on an as reported basis and we expect consumer interactive to be up low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.207 billion and $1.225 billion, up 16% to 17%. We expect 1.5 points of benefit from FX. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 130 to 160 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.63 and $3.70, up 21% to 23%. At this time, we have no material update to our other guided items about tax rate, G&A, interest expense and capital expenditures. They remain the same as what we have provided on our year-end earnings call in February. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks Todd. And to conclude this morning, we took you through a strong second quarter and a much more bullish outlook for the full year based on significantly strengthened macro trends across most of our markets. And we highlighted two large growing market positions that have helped propel TransUnion to best-in-class growth since our IPO and which we believe will allow us to remain on that growth path. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, we ask that each of you ask only one question so that we can include more participants. Now, we'll take those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: I just had a question around, you know, your comments you made around actively pursuing attractive investments just given the healthy balance sheet. Like I guess how should we think about that? Is that mostly organic or should we start seeing - and if it is, should we start seeing some buybacks or is there still active M&A pipeline out there?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, hey Manav good morning. This is Chris. It\u2019s really both areas. I mean, certainly we had accelerated our organic investments in new product development. We've built out talent under the umbrella of our Global Solutions organization focused on our key and common solutions that we offer across the full enterprise. We've increased the number of Scrum teams or technologies on our product development, and then we're accessing and investing in more data. In addition, as we have migrated, this global operating model and we're investing and improving different components of our operations, we\u2019ve put more dollars toward our project to streamline and standardize our operational processes around the world and to implement a new state-of-the-art CRM and order management platform. We've boosted advertising in our direct-to-consumer business. And in general, we have also increased our technology investment outside of that which we add back related to project rise. Now, to the second part of your question, I mean, as you know, it's a very robust and active M&A market. We - as we say in every call, we continue to be engaged in the market evaluating different opportunities for TransUnion. And we'll be there as appropriate opportunities arise. I think Todd wanted to add a few things.\nTodd Cello: Yes, hey Manav. Thanks for the question and I'll just speak a little bit more specifically about M&A. So as you've seen, our leverage ratio has ticked down to 2.4 times at the end of the second quarter. That's the lowest mark since our IPO in 2015. So clearly that provides us with a significant amount of balance sheet capacity. In addition to that, we feel really good that we have access to the capital markets at very attractive terms. And I would say, in my 20-plus years with the company that I've never seen a pipeline of deals that teams working through right now. And I guess what I would say to that too is, this is aligned to the strategy that we've talked about continuously. First being, we're always out on the lookout for data assets to create a fuller and more comprehensive profile on the consumer. We're always looking for new capabilities for our vertical markets. We're always looking to get into new markets, whether that's adjacencies onto our existing verticals or its new international markets. But the one thing I'll leave you with is that, we remain very disciplined in this environment, especially due to the elevated asset values that are out there.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. I'm hoping you can talk through kind of new product sales trends in international markets. It sounds like it's been good in the U.S. for a while. And I'm wondering how unique that is with the bank balance sheet strength, the stimulus, the level of competition? And I guess what I'm trying to parse out is to what extent the international revenue trends on a two-year basis is more a reflection of just a delayed an market recovery or if new product sales have been as good there as they've been in the U.S.?\nChris Cartwright: Yes good question. So, for quite a few quarters now, we\u2019ve commented on the strength of our new product sales in the U.S. and I believe, internationally too. And I guess, the short answer to the question is, they've been just as strong internationally as they have been in the U.S. As we said before, there is a great deal of sharing of sales practices and product positioning expertise and the like that takes place between the countries and the portfolio and the respective verticals, as well as our go-to-market sales discipline. I think we\u2019re looking to accommodate that strong products having vertical leaders who understand the industry and are tuned to the current needs of the market and continually investing to improve our go-to-market practices that's allowed us to notch a lot of sales wins. And again we talked, I think in the depth of the pandemic about how we launched Project Eliminate. The origins of that project actually began in the international markets, and then it became an enterprise-wide effort. So, we've had really good success, and I think you can see in our results that we're starting this year to show the revenue benefits of the wins that we notched last year. With all that said, Jeff, obviously, the rebound in the markets helps a lot. The strongest rebound we experienced was here in the U.S. That's a function of the availability of the vaccine. And as we've talked elsewhere, a lot of our international markets are in [technical difficulty] the pandemic and are now only beginning to recover. We think that's a good thing for us in the intermediate term.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: I wanted to jump into slide number 6. I do appreciate you helping us to understand your mix of your portfolio in consumer lending. And I truly understand that the slide was divided between FinTech lenders on the right and non-FinTech lenders on the left. But just help me understand what's going into these short-term lending categories versus all other -- like where is credit card? And also, when you look at the $200 million on this slide, what percentage of this slide is in U.S. mortgage?\nTodd Cello: Yes. So, hey, Andrew. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. [technical difficulty] specifically just looking within U.S. markets, financial services, and when we talk about the business, we talk about the four lines, we talk about mortgage, we talk about auto, we talk about credit card, and then we talk about consumer lending. So this is the break out of consumer lending. So specific to your question about credit card, predominantly, our revenues for credit cards are within the credit card line within financial services. So that's where you're going to find that at. Otherwise, as the FinTech branch out into new lines of business, we'll capture that revenue in the 50% piece of the pie. And then as it pertains to the short-term lending, I'm going to let Chris answer that question on the short-term lending what's in there.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. The short-term lenders would be a mix of the payday lenders, store front lenders, lenders that previously - the trade lines were aggregated by our FactorTrust business. The more down market, some title lending and the like.\nAndrew Steinerman: And the buy now pay later is within FinTech, right?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. That's correct.\nOperator: The next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMario Cortellacci: This is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Just a quick question on the Fraud and ID business. Could you update us on what's the current exposure is in the portfolio as of today? And then, I guess, maybe you can also update us on how much more M&A you could do in that space and how that product currently is differentiated from its competitors? Obviously it's a very fragmented market, but we'd love to get an update there?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. So three parts to your question. We're having a touch of audio issues here the first part, were you asking regarding the exposure like the percentage of our portfolio revenue that is\u2026\nMario Cortellacci: Correct. Yes.\nTodd Cello: Yes. So, I'll answer that question, Hamzah, when you think about - and I'm sorry, it's not Hamzah, Mario, sorry. As far as what Fraud represents, just think of that as the second largest product category that TransUnion has globally. And obviously, that's behind just core credit. And so that's how to size that one.\nChris Cartwright: [technical difficulty] it's differentiation. I mean, going back to the basics, right. The knowledge that we have regarding the composition of consumers\u2019 wallets their credits essentially as well as the public record and types we have by operating an investigated business based on public records in the U.S. gives us a great foundation for knowledge-based authentication, which is a traditional way of doing it. And we have tens of millions of dollars in business not only in the U.S., but around the world that we've developed over time. Today, using that as a foundation, we expanded through the acquisition of Trustev, but most importantly iovation and became one of the leading players in device-based authentication. We have seen billions of unique devices from almost every country around the world. And we have a reputational history [technical difficulty] which is shared across our network of consumers. Beyond that, we have invested and then added portfolio of fraud mitigation point solutions that we offer through our umbrella of TruValidate, which would include document uploading, fingerprint or biometric verification. The whole - the panoply of signals that comes into these fraud solutions ends up in an underlying data management layer where data scientist build fraud scoring and risk scoring algorithms. And then based on that we use our decisioning software to allow lenders to allow all types of clients to configure the actions they want to take based on the risk of an individual transaction. So net-net, it\u2019s the range of services from the traditional [technical difficulty] and just the scope of the solution on top of this integrated data layer that's really are differentiation. We feel that we're one of the most complete and global players out there in the market.\nMario Cortellacci: And then just on the M&A piece, just further scaling that business given how fragmented the market is?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, the market is fragmented and we - look, there's a whole range of opportunity. The valuations are extremely high. We've got a great path to integrate and improve our current holdings through organic product development and we're investing in that. That said, we're constantly in the market. We're pursuing partnerships where appropriate. We would consider minority investments in capabilities that we feel are [technical difficulty] acquisition if we think it's going to drive growth and we can get a good return on.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Bisbee of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Bisbee: Thanks for the color on FinTech and public sector. That was interesting. I just wanted to step back. And if we think of the next three to five years and delivering to the growth algorithm you've discussed, how would you say the composition of that growth is going to compare to the last five years? And I guess do you need a lot more singles and doubles to deliver given that there were a couple of outsized opportunities historically like trended data adoption and the massive step-up in innovation you had after the initial tech transformation? It gets - all things considered, how do you feel like the portfolio today is positioned to deliver over the next several years? Is it as well-positioned or sort of maybe if you could comment on what you think the top couple of opportunities are over multiyear forward-looking period. Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Okay. Gary, I understand the question. And I mean, look, obviously, I\u2019m somewhat biased in this answer, but I\u2019m pretty optimistic about the platform we've got in total. I've been a lot of different information services businesses. And one of the biggest keys to success is growth in the end user markets that you serve. So, I would just start there and say that, one thing I love about our business is that even in the oldest of our lines of business, there's still a heck of a lot of innovation and a lot of end user growth, and we're well positioned to service that. The second thing I would say is that, this platform of new products from vintages kind of have been - is still in the early to mid-stages of adoption. I would bet you, Gary, that if we're still around five years from now doing this, you and I will still be talking about trended data adoption across parts of our portfolio, right? And I guarantee you we'll be talking about the expansion of scope and currency and accuracy of a boatload of alternative datasets that are going to help us score more consumers around the globe and give lending and other business institutions better insights to manage their marketing spend, their risk appetites, their portfolios generally. On top of that, you see us - and we're not alone in this pushing more into technological delivery of these data and insights through solutions like Prama and others [technical difficulty] to support a wider range of our customers\u2019 workflows, their internal processes that are kind of industry standard that we can bring technological know-how and broader data and make these processes more standardized and more repeatable, right? So, I think those three things alone provide us with some really nice drivers of growth. On top of that, there's a lot of talent here that is motivated and incented to innovate and to grow based on the platform. We talk a lot about our growth playbook. We talk about the deep expertise we hold in the end user markets that we serve. That's going to produce new ideas and new innovation. And the fact that we're evolving our technology again through Project Rise means that we're going to be able to realize these ideas as new products faster and more flexibly than we think. And then on top of that, I would layer inorganic. Right? As Todd said, we've de-levered. We've got a healthy balance sheet. We have a clear strategy for growing and serving our customers, and they're going to be attractive opportunities that arise over this period that we will take advantage of.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Thanks for taking my question. In terms of the guidance for emerging verticals, I think that's the only piece of business where expectations are unchanged versus last quarter. So, I'm hoping you could kind of unpack that a bit further. Is that simply a consequence of those businesses being on the whole a bit less exposed to macro trends or have there been some factors within that segment that are offsetting some outperformance by maybe what you'd consider to be some of the more pro-cyclical components of that segment? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So on the emerging verticals, I guess I'd start off just looking at our - at our full-year guidance for 2021. So we are expecting that business to be up in the low double digit range. And within my prepared remarks earlier, I rattled through just a lot of the really good momentum that we have in many of those markets. And Chris in particular spent time talking about public sector in his remarks, and so that's definitely an area of strength for us. Insurance continues to also be an area of outsized growth for us as well, which I highlighted. But [technical difficulty] of some of the other verticals that we're in like tenant and employment screening are showing a nice rebound as well as just some of the other diversified markets that we - that we operate in. So all-in-all, I would say that the verticals that make up these group are performing well. Now the only area right now is health care which I also talked about in my remarks in that business has been a little bit slower to recover than the other vertical markets. And that's just simply a product of how strained the health care system was during the pandemic. Many of hospitals - of providers were focused on COVID care, and they were not focused on more of the elective procedures as just patients were not comfortable getting into that setting. But as we indicated, within the front-end of our business start to pick up meaningfully. So - I mean, just as a reminder, the front-end think of products like insurance eligibility. So that means patients are back, right. So, the volumes are ticking up nicely in that space. Also, estimization of care as well too is another area that's strong. And what happens is there's a lag effect for the back end of the revenue cycle management, probably three to four months. And the back end of our healthcare business is truly where TransUnion is differentiated. And we are expecting that business to return to growth. So, the way and I - and then - and just to reiterate, what I again I said early on in call, the business had its highest amount of bookings in the [technical difficulty] this is isn't line. This is bookings, right. So I mean that just gives us a lot of optimism. So - and as I said, we expect the business to return to growth. So if I were to say that's the only vertical within the emerging that's really holding us back. But we're very optimistic about where this business is - the trajectory of it and what it's setting up for in Q3, Q4, but more importantly 2022.\nTodd Cello: Yes. I think that those are great points. And I just want to emphasize that during this period, the COVID period, the performance of the Emerging Verticals in total has been muted a little because healthcare with the mid digits negative - mid-single digits negative in the depths of the pandemic. But now that we're recovering, if you exclude healthcare and Todd gave a lot of useful detail on healthcare. The rest of the portfolio is recovering so did double digits, right? And of course, given my experience in U.S. markets, I know that a portion of those emerging markets are small business certainly relatively to our financial services one verticals. And they were particularly hard hit during the pandemic and I think it will take a little bit longer for them to recover. But that said, they are recovering and I think you're going to see acceleration in that in the quarters ahead.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. It sounds like you're very confident in both the U.S. and international and you said that the improving environment we're seeing a lot of data points supporting that. But just wanted to understand how you're thinking about potential impact from the Delta variant. Are you just feeling it as a non-event or are you - have you included any haircut in the guidance? And I'm sure that's offset by better lending environment, but just want to get into the pieces a little bit more within the guidance. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Good question as we see the acceleration of new COVID cases due to the Delta variant. Well, first of all, obviously its terrible development for the country given the wide availability of vaccines. I think 60% of the country has received at least one shot. But as you know, the rate of inoculations decelerated a lot and we still have a bit of a philosophical divide. Personally, I'm hoping we're going to bridge that divide. I think you see politically opinions are now consistent around the importance of getting vaccinations, and a lot of folks in a lot of rural areas have shied away from that. How that all factors into our GDP - into our guidance? It\u2019s not [technical difficulty] we\u2019re - that were currently - we don\u2019t currently believe we\u2019re going to have to alter our guidance as a result of this. We just think it\u2019s obviously an unfortunate thing for the country. And we hope it\u2019s the situation that starts to remedy itself in the weeks and near months ahead.\nOperator: The next question is from Shlomo Rosenbaum of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thank you for squeezing me in over here. Chris, the numbers look really good, and the momentum of the business seems like its really returning. And when I think about it, I'm thinking about more of standing back and looking at - how should we be thinking about this in terms of just returning back to normal in terms of the really good momentum? And one of the things that I think about here is kind of the risks on the regulatory side. And I was wondering if you could comment a little bit about that in terms of what are you seeing now over six months in with the change of administration? And particularly, the 10-Q discloses that the kind of NO-A letter from the CFPB and I was wondering if that had to do at all in your view with hey, there's a change of administration. Maybe they have kind of a different way of looking at things and if you kind of give us your thoughts on that and how we should think about it over the next near and intermediate term?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure Shlomo, let me unbundle that a little bit first, regarding the momentum in the business. I mean, clearly, the second quarter of 2021 reflects a step function improvement in the business due to underlying economic activity and some of our own market success. And I think we've detailed that quite a bit over the course of this conversation in our disclosure. Again, as Todd said that, I don\u2019t think the market rebound is done for us. And I think there\u2019s more gas in that in the U.S. and even more internationally given what said earlier about just the relative states of the pandemic in the different countries we serve. Now, pivoting to Washington, I mean yes, the current administration and various branches of government are keenly interested in providing consumer with accurate and accessible credit information that enables their participation in lending and the economy. And we're actively engaged in discussions explaining what we do, why it's accurate and effective, and how it supports the U.S. economy and the economies in the various markets that we serve. That said, their current philosophies, their positions about how to affect the best outcomes, where I think all parties are aligned is that we want to increase the scorable population by incorporating more sets of alternative data beyond traditional credit. The private sector, namely the three bureaus, because of market competition and desire for innovation, I believe have done a very good job in the recent years of expanding the pie of growing financial inclusion by migrating the trended data sets and incorporating a multitude of alternative data that is predictive of credit behavior. The other thing I feel the industry has done well is greatly broaden consumers\u2019 access to their credit information. And their ability to understand it, to dispute it to \u2013 and receive offers \u2013 financial offers based on it. But that said look, I expect to remain actively engaged explaining, advocating and just discussing with legislators and regulators alike about the right balance and the best solution to serve the American public. The other thing I would mention is with regard to the NO-A letter as we disclosed. We received a notice and opportunity to respond and advice regarding our position on our compliance with the 2017 consent order that we entered into. I believe that we are in compliance and we're looking forward to an opportunity to discuss this with the regulator. We're going to continue to cooperate. We're going to continue to collaborate. And we hope to have this matter behind us in a relative winter.\nOperator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for talking my question and congrats on a solid results. I just wanted to follow-up on the comments in the prepared remarks regarding a top five issuer switching to VantageScore and increased traction for VantageScore? I was just wondering if you could provide any color on what's driving that increased traction? Are you seeing that across both traditional lenders as well as FinTech? Is it focused on any particular lending products or origination portfolio management or marketing? And just any thoughts on potential for inclusion or for GSEs to start accepting VantageScores for mortgages as well so any color on the traction for VantageScore? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Sure Ashish, you probably know this already, but there was an article that ran in the Wall Street Journal, I believe it was over the weekend or perhaps, I mean toward the end of last week, that I feel we did a good job covering the landscape of adoption of the VantageScore. So, I would refer you to that for some additional color beyond we\u2019ll share here. The reason for the increasing adoption of the VantageScore is that it works really well. It's based on the merger of the three bureaus\u2019 data, and it's been demonstrated time and again to score and score accurately the broadest number of consumers in the U.S. There have been a variety of obstacles to its full adoption. However, we for many years now, have said that Vantage is well, gaining broad acceptance typically in full flow management and also in direct-to-consumer offerings, but increasingly in loan origination. And I think the fact that the top five card issuer and \u2013 has adopted it for all loan origination as well as loan syndication, which was another barrier to acceptance. I think it\u2019s a powerful \u2013 as a powerful comment on the state of thinking amongst top issuers and top lenders. As that article pointed out, from the lender in question is not the only lender in the top five that has adopted innovative score for origination and there are other banks that are thinking hard about this or in the process of migrating to Vantage.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Appreciate you taking my question. Chris, I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on some of your new data set initiatives, specifically income and employment, it sounds like you're making nice inroads on tenant screening. Wondered if you could speak more broadly to your ambitions and outlook for, I guess new data sets broadly, but the employment and verification piece specifically?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, look, starting there, we some time ago stood as a team to focus on charting our entry into this business. We there is a great opportunity to build a product and to migrate to the front of customer cascades during the origination process. We've struck relationships well one, a large payroll processor with financial account aggregators that get us access to deposit information. And the business development efforts to expand the breadth of our data archives are ongoing and will remain ongoing from this point forward, right. That said, as you know, we face a very large and entrenched competitor. We're not claiming at this point that our archives are as strong as theirs, certainly not. But they are competitive and we are winning some business, and we are super excited and putting a lot of wood behind this arrow, if you will. In terms of other data sets, as we\u2019ve said previously, fraud is our second largest category worldwide. We think there\u2019s an enormous growth potential there. We\u2019re very interested in data around [technical difficulty] identifier, device reputation, e-commerce-related identifiers. And so, we\u2019re in the market both gathering those directly to our own tool sets, but also licensing in that type of data and integrating it into our identity graphs. So we are kind of matching logic.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Aaron Hoffman for closing remarks.\nAaron Hoffman: Great, thank you Kate. Thanks everyone, for joining us this morning. As always, we really appreciate your time. And we're going to wrap up here because we know it's a very busy earnings day. And make sure you all have some time to digest our earnings as well as a lot of other companies. So again, thank you for your time. Have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks Chris. We knew entering the quarter that we would see our easiest comparisons of the year and thus, likely our strongest quarterly performance. As Chris discussed, that was the case at most of our businesses declined in the second quarter of 2020 as we all grappled with the most severe impacts of the pandemic. And as expected, almost all of our businesses posted very strong growth in this quarter as markets continue to recover. We continue to monetize these business wins across our portfolio, and we benefited from easy comparison. In order to help you appreciate the long-term trends and the above-market performance in the current quarter, I think it's instructive to look back at our growth in the second quarter of 2019 and 2020. Doing so helps make more sense out of the very large increases we posted across the business this quarter. To that end, this slide shows you how we performed in the second quarter of this year for the same quarter over the past two years. The conclusion is that we have delivered attractive growth above the underlying market including the outsized recovery this quarter. This holds true for almost every segment, vertical, and region. Now, let me take you through our performance starting with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all the comparisons I discuss today will be against the second quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 22% on a reported basis and 20% in constant currency. The Signal and Tru Optik acquisition had just about one point of impact. So, organic constant currency growth was 19%. Excluding mortgage, which represented about 13% of total revenue in the second quarter from both the second quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 21% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% on a reported and 29% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 41.1%, up 290 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter driven primarily by the significant revenue outperformance. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 46%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth and the benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancing, prepayment, and lower LIBOR, as well as a slightly lower adjusted tax rate of 23.2%. I also want to address one other item as it had a significant impact on our reported EPS what was backed out of our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS in the same way we accounted for the reserves that we previously booked. During the quarter, the United States Supreme Court reversed the circuit court opinion related to a class action suit called Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC. As the court reduced the size of the class by more than 75%, and remanded the matter back to the lower court for further proceedings, we reduced our reserves by $32.4 million. Now, looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets' revenue was up 20% compared to the year-ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had 2 points of impact on revenue. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue grew 22%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 22% as reported and 24% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 100 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth, partially offset by our continued strategic and operational investments and the cost to integrate and scale our recent media acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical, Financial Services revenue grew 22% and was up 35% excluding mortgage. Notably, consumer lending, auto and credit card each delivered very strong results. While mortgage slowed significantly on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending surged on the strength of historically strong credit applications and marketing activities, which disproportionately benefits TransUnion, given the strong leadership position Chris outlined. Lenders have aggressively stepped up their customer acquisition activity as consumer spending has increased. With that said, there are still more upside ahead once credit card balances return and debt consolidation becomes more attractive. Likewise, short-term lenders are just beginning to see significant recovery in buy now pay later and point of sale continuing to grow. We also had a very strong quarter in our credit card business, with similar customer behavior in FinTech lending resulting in a high watermark for applications and marketing activity. Notably, we recently saw a top five U.S. card issuer where TransUnion is a primary provider of credit services switched away from FICO scores and replace them with VantageScore. This one - this may set the stage for other lenders to follow suit. Other markets continue to be solid despite constrained new car inventory. We have benefited from meaningful demand recovery in the subprime segment since the beginning of the year, where TransUnion had a strong share position. We also continue to see strength in prequalification solutions as more consumers shift to digital commerce. And for mortgage for the full year, we continue to expect the market to be roughly flat Continuing to expect the market to be roughly flat, in flat with our previous view. However, with volatile rates and purchase market strain due to a lack of inventory and correspondingly higher prices, we continue to anticipate year-over-year declines in mortgage for the remainder of 2021. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals which grew 17% on a reported basis and 13% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. We saw strong double digit growth in almost all of our major verticals. Public sector, as Chris discussed in depth, remains a very strong growth sector for TransUnion and continuing to deliver outstanding growth even after an outstanding 2020. Even as most government operations continue business as usual, we also continue to identify new opportunities born from the pandemic and changing policies and new programs from the Biden administration. Added an employment screening was very strong particularly for tenant screening as we benefited from our expanded partnerships with large growing rental screening firms using our Smart Move solution. We also won a meaningful contract with a large partner to provide income and employment verification for rental screening. We expect employment screening to continue to pick up momentum as the U.S. returns to full employment levels. And our media vertical continues to deliver attractive growth even as we sign new accounts. One to note is our partnership with OpenAP, a consortium of Fox, NBC Universal and Viacom CBS. OpenAP aspires to build an industry standard ID that incorporates a broad range of streaming signals to help advertisers build targeted audiences and measure impact Tru Optik data underpins and enable this identifier, so we are well-positioned to grow with OpenAP and other media companies like Blockgraph Comscore, and MediaMath as they roll out their own identifiers and grow. We also saw insurance deliver a very strong quarter behind a brisk pace of business win for our expanded set of solutions such as DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, CreditVision, Prefill, and TruValidate. We are also starting to see traction on the digital marketing side, similar to what we're seeing in the financial services, and winning new business on the strength of our Tru Audience platform. And finally, our healthcare vertical, revenue was down slightly but we continue to see front-end volumes improved and monetized quickly. As we've discussed in the past, front-end volumes take three or four months to flow through to the back end of our business which is roughly twice the size of the front end. In the second quarter, we realized the highest level of new business wins in our history, setting us up to return to growth in the second half of the year and further positioning us for a good 2022 as the market more fully recovers. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 6% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5% as we continue to increase marketing in the direct channel during the quarter. That marketing helped drive low-double digit revenue growth in our direct business and a solid increase in our subscriber base. Consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Our indirect channel returned to growth as lenders have increased their marketing activity and we continue strength with partners who provide identity protection for consumers. For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 32% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 75% as a result of the strong revenue growth and particularly easy comparisons to the year ago quarter. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 20% as lending markets continue their march back to pre-COVID levels and strong growth persisted in other markets like fraud and online gaming and gambling. And of note, we won another meaningful but largely one-time contract with the U.K. government to help consumers re-engage in more normal work social activity. Our Canadian business grew 25% in the second quarter as lending market slowly recovered and the business benefited from considerable portfolio diversification in fast growing areas like insurance, fraud, direct-to-consumer and FinTech. During the quarter, we also benefited from some one-time breach remediation business as we have over the past several years. In India, we grew 54% despite the negative impact of lockdowns in April and May. We ended the first quarter with lending markets nearly back at pre-pandemic levels, but that was short lived as the lockdown refocused consumer attention from shopping and borrowing for their health and welfare. As the surge abated, we saw lending markets steadily recover in the second quarter, though, a significant upside likely to come over the remainder of the year. At the same time, our diversified portfolio continues to offer a buoyancy and a difficult environment. We continue to see strength in commercial credit scoring, government programs, and fraud mitigation. We also expanded our thought leadership series, TGIF or TransUnion Great Information Fridays, to include CFOs and CMOs for the first time, deepening our already strong customer relationships. We also partnered with Google to deliver a report that provides trends and insights on the increasing reliance of consumers on the Internet for purchasing credit products caused by the unprecedented rise in digital adoption. In Latin America, revenue was up 46% in the strength of double digit growth in our two largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. Many of the smaller countries in Central America have returned to growth, and we expect significant additional recovery in the quarters to come. In Asia Pacific, we grew 27% driven by continued recovery in our largest market, Hong Kong, as well as positive momentum with our re-launched direct-to-consumer offerings and business wins with lending customers. Finally, Africa increased 37%. In our largest market, South Africa, the economy has started to show signs of improvement with expectations for annual GDP raised to 4.3% despite the slow pace of vaccination. Our business has seen continued strength of CreditVision insurance-related solutions. One of the many strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $526 million of cash on the balance sheet. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continue to decline from 2.7 times at the end of the first quarter to 2.4 times at the end of June. With our strong balance sheet, we remain in a good position to continue to proactively pursue additional attractive investments, which remain an important part of our long-term growth strategy. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Starting with third quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than 1 point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik, as well as a 1.5 point tailwind to revenue from FX and we expect 1.5 points of benefit to adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue is expected to come in between $766 million and $777 million or a 10% to 12% increase and organic constant currency revenue growth is expected to be up 8% to 10%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate 4 point headwind for mortgage, meaning that the business would grow 12% to 14% excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $301 million and $308 million, an increase of 12% to 14%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.91 and $0.93, an increase of 12% to 15%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and 1.5 point tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $3.034 billion to $3.059 billion, up 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes 1.5 to 2 points of headwinds from mortgage for the full year. To help with your modeling, we currently expect mortgage to be a 3 point headwind in the fourth quarter. For our business segments, we expect US markets, financial services and emerging verticals each be up low double-digits. Excluding the impact of mortgage, U.S. markets would be up mid-teens, financial services would be up high teens. We anticipate that international will grow more than 20% on an as reported basis and we expect consumer interactive to be up low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.207 billion and $1.225 billion, up 16% to 17%. We expect 1.5 points of benefit from FX. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 130 to 160 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be between $3.63 and $3.70, up 21% to 23%. At this time, we have no material update to our other guided items about tax rate, G&A, interest expense and capital expenditures. They remain the same as what we have provided on our year-end earnings call in February. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Yes, hey Manav. Thanks for the question and I'll just speak a little bit more specifically about M&A. So as you've seen, our leverage ratio has ticked down to 2.4 times at the end of the second quarter. That's the lowest mark since our IPO in 2015. So clearly that provides us with a significant amount of balance sheet capacity. In addition to that, we feel really good that we have access to the capital markets at very attractive terms. And I would say, in my 20-plus years with the company that I've never seen a pipeline of deals that teams working through right now. And I guess what I would say to that too is, this is aligned to the strategy that we've talked about continuously. First being, we're always out on the lookout for data assets to create a fuller and more comprehensive profile on the consumer. We're always looking for new capabilities for our vertical markets. We're always looking to get into new markets, whether that's adjacencies onto our existing verticals or its new international markets. But the one thing I'll leave you with is that, we remain very disciplined in this environment, especially due to the elevated asset values that are out there. Yes. So, hey, Andrew. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. [technical difficulty] specifically just looking within U.S. markets, financial services, and when we talk about the business, we talk about the four lines, we talk about mortgage, we talk about auto, we talk about credit card, and then we talk about consumer lending. So this is the break out of consumer lending. So specific to your question about credit card, predominantly, our revenues for credit cards are within the credit card line within financial services. So that's where you're going to find that at. Otherwise, as the FinTech branch out into new lines of business, we'll capture that revenue in the 50% piece of the pie. And then as it pertains to the short-term lending, I'm going to let Chris answer that question on the short-term lending what's in there. Yes. So, I'll answer that question, Hamzah, when you think about - and I'm sorry, it's not Hamzah, Mario, sorry. As far as what Fraud represents, just think of that as the second largest product category that TransUnion has globally. And obviously, that's behind just core credit. And so that's how to size that one. Yes. I think that those are great points. And I just want to emphasize that during this period, the COVID period, the performance of the Emerging Verticals in total has been muted a little because healthcare with the mid digits negative - mid-single digits negative in the depths of the pandemic. But now that we're recovering, if you exclude healthcare and Todd gave a lot of useful detail on healthcare. The rest of the portfolio is recovering so did double digits, right? And of course, given my experience in U.S. markets, I know that a portion of those emerging markets are small business certainly relatively to our financial services one verticals. And they were particularly hard hit during the pandemic and I think it will take a little bit longer for them to recover. But that said, they are recovering and I think you're going to see acceleration in that in the quarters ahead."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy and beginning to enjoy a return to more normal activity in your life. At TransUnion, while our associates continue to largely work from home, we have begun to slowly reenter the workplace in a thoughtful and safe fashion. We've started to conduct small in-person meetings in our offices. In fact, Todd, Aaron, and I are together in-person today for the first time in almost a year and a half. In the U.S., we currently plan to gradually return to in-office work in the fall. Though with significant flexibility to capitalize on the benefits, many employees enjoy working from home. Now, I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will discuss some of the broad macro and TransUnion specific trends that we experienced in the second quarter as well as highlight some recent progress related to social justice issues and other areas where we can make a difference as an organization. Next, in the context of our unique market positions and approach, I will discuss two growth areas; consumer lending and the public sector, to illustrate several dimensions of this approach that have consistently resulted in outsized long-term organic growth. Finally I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our second quarter results in detail along with third quarter and full-year 2021 guidance. So, let me start with our second quarter performance. We posted very strong results as markets generally continue to rebound and our growth outpaced underlying market recovery on the strength of new business wins and a steady stream of new product innovation. Todd will discuss some of the specific revenue trends later as part of his remarks. In the U.S. where consumer spending has surged ahead of pre-COVID levels and consumers have substantial capacity to borrow, the recovery appears to be in full swing, although not yet complete. We expect additional recovery-driven upside in most of our U.S. businesses, particularly consumer lending, employment screening, collections and healthcare. At the same time, we believe that recovery in our international markets has only begun despite very impressive growth this quarter. In emerging markets like India, the Philippines, South Africa and much of Latin America, we see considerable upside as those markets improve over the next 6 to 12 months. Importantly, beyond market-based recovery we continue to deliver growth above our underlying markets. Todd will lay this out in greater detail, but you'll see that our multiyear growth stack in the second quarter clearly shows that the strong results we posted represent a combination of market recovery and organic growth. For instance, in the second quarter of the U.S., CreditVision and CreditVision Link grew almost 50%, well ahead of our strong financial services growth, reflecting the significant win that we've discussed in previous quarters. On our insurance vertical, which grew more than 20% in the quarter. We outpaced industry recovery on the strength of share gains and deeper penetration within our customers. More on our tenant and employment screening vertical where our focus on leveraging strategic tenant and screening partners have paid off and helped to deliver 30% growth in the quarter. We see the same sort of outperformance in our international markets driven by meaningful wins in every region, including new insurance and FinTech customers in Canada, new business with the U.K. government, strong CreditVision performance in South Africa, and new business with key lending customers in India. Given our strong second quarter and the increasingly positive macro environment, we have raised our full-year 2021 guidance again. Todd will provide you with the details shortly. Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high-single digit revenue growth at an expanding attractive margin with double-digit EPS spread. We also remain focused on how we conduct business and the positive impact we can have on our associates, our communities, and all of our stakeholders. To that end, we've increased our disclosure and established meaningful targets for workforce diversity and similar strategic imperatives to improve our business. For instance, during the quarter, we implemented a global supplier diversity procurement process. Also during the second quarter, a well-regarded third-party completed a global assessment of our energy and carbon footprint. We've provided the 2019 and 2020 baseline data on our website. Using this data, we will develop appropriate targets to reduce our environmental impact. We also launched a thorough materiality assessment to refresh our understanding of key stakeholders' views about TransUnion. This will further inform our future disclosure and target setting. So, now I'll pivot to discuss our long-term growth priorities. On our last call, I spent some time delineating TransUnion's differentiated market-positioning approach which fuels our long-term growth algorithm. Let me quickly review each of these differentiators. First, we've taken an innovator and attacker position across our markets and built a track record of delivering outsized unit growth across markets we serve by disrupting - through disruption and market share gains. In addition to our attractive market position, we have a proven scalable enterprise growth playbook. Based on the foundation of customer and consumer insights, we've developed a repeatable approach to client engagement, product innovation and adjacency expansion. We complement the growth playbook with powerful proprietary and third-party data assets. In addition to our traditional attractive position in consumer credit data, we have developed an array of alternative data assets to serve core in high-growth use cases. Next, our industry-leading technology remains a competitive advantage. I've regularly discussed our proven track record of delivering on large scale complex technology initiatives as well as Project Rise, our current program to make TransUnion's technology more scalable, secure, efficient and effective, and to keep us on the cutting edge of cloud computing and information security. And finally, underpinning these market positions, our culture emphasizes customer focus and partnership. We've built a company that understands the needs of customers and consumers and can deliver best-in-class solutions to meet those needs. We also balance the sense of humility with a deep inner drive to be successful and accountable while also taking a collaborative approach both internally and externally. So with that review as a backdrop, I want to provide a deep dive on two growth vectors, consumer lending and our public sector vertical. Now, candidly, we could have chosen for many other vertical solutions or geographic markets. We chose these two as a - to industry how we take an attacker position in attractive markets, also how we utilize the go-to-market approach in our growth playbook, and how we leverage data assets across the company. So let's start off with consumer lending which includes a number of lending in markets such as FinTech, short-term lending, point-of-sale, and buy now pay later. Our total consumer lending business has generated about $200 million of annual revenue in recent years, running above that mark in 2019 and dipping below in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic. Given our current trajectory, we expect to set a new high watermark above $200 million this year. FinTech represents the largest portion of the consumer business at about 50% of revenue followed by short-term lending at about 25% of revenue. Point-of-sale and now buy now pay later lending, while growing quickly, account for a low-single digit percentage of the consumer lending business. For my discussion today, I'm going to focus primarily on the FinTech portion of the business given its size and growth characteristics. From 2017 through 2019, FinTech revenue increased about 55% and then declined in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. We expect to see another significant leg of growth this year as the market rebounds and we benefit from recent share gains. TransUnion has a strategy of looking for the next major innovation in financial services, and we stay close to industry participants as well as venture capitalists to develop our viewpoint. More than a decade ago, we identified the burgeoning FinTech market as a significant opportunity. We developed a strategy that continues to this day, to engage early-stage FinTechs, partner to go to market quickly with TransUnion-enabled risk, fraud, and marketing solutions, and then support their expansion with thought leadership, industry expertise, and innovation. To formalize this approach, we created a FinTech startup kit making it as easy as possible for new players to enter the market using our data, our models and our expertise. As winners emerge, we've positioned ourselves as their primary and frequently exclusive bureau partner. And that leadership position continues today as we remain the primary partner to the majority of FinTech lenders. As we help enable the growth of the industry, we learned from our partners, allowing us to refine our strategy and solidify our leadership with new and existing customers. We now have a formal FinTech advisory board that has played a key role in new product development either by existing ideas or helping us to define our own. For example, based on input from our advisory board members, we developed a number of prescreen and prequalification solutions to enable FinTechs as well as our core financial services customers to provide more relevant credit offers to more consumers with increased convenience. Going back five years and based on feedback from our advisory board, we created our innovation lab to bring customers onsite for an immersive process to solve a specific problem or develop a new model leveraging the full range of our data capabilities and expertise at TransUnion, all enabled by our 2016 Technology Transformation Project Spark, since we've had tremendous success using Innovation Lab to deepen and strengthen customer relationships with FinTech lenders as well as our core financial services partners and have expanded recently to engage with insurance customers. The other strong relationships are innovation, particularly credit vision and credit vision link has played an important role in solidifying our leadership position. Going forward, we have a significant opportunity to drive growth through greater penetration of fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer solutions. Our leadership position has also helped us develop a differentiated file as we see such a high percentage of consumer imports. As you would expect, all three bureaus capture the trend line data when a lender issues a loan. However, only the bureau providing data for the application sees the inquiry. Given our broad coverage in this space, we see a disproportionate amount of the inquiries, which helps in two ways. First, customers can drive insights about consumer behavior if they see a pattern develop. And second, comprehensive inquiry data helps us identify loan stacking fraud and other key risk factors in a way that our competitors cannot match. As we look forward, despite our exceptional growth and strong share position, we expect considerable more growth in the future. First, as I mentioned earlier, we have meaningful opportunities to deepen our penetration with our customers in fraud mitigation, marketing, and direct-to-consumer initiatives. Second, FinTech players continue to diversify from mono-line lending into multi-line lending, and we advise many of them as they enter areas like car, auto, and mortgage. Third, broadly within consumer lending, while small today, we see buy now, pay later, and point-of-sale lending as attractive growth factors. We've taken the same approach with these lenders as we did with FinTechs in their earlier days and have enabled - and helped to enable their success. We started with fraud solutions, and it pivoted to more traditional credit offerings as we capture significant portions of their traffic just as we did with FinTech. In addition to these opportunities in the U.S., we also have a meaningful business internationally with substantial growth potential. Year to date, FinTech represents about 13% of total international segment revenue. But has accounted for roughly 25% of the segment's growth. The U.K. has the most developed international FinTech market and it accounts for almost 60% of our international FinTech revenue. The next largest markets include India and Canada, followed by Hong Kong, Brazil and Colombia. We also have nascent businesses in South Africa and the Philippines. Interestingly, FinTechs in these markets have a more diverse portfolio addressing opportunities to the shop and offer differentiated consumer experiences across not only traditional lending and buy now pay later, but also digital banking, payments and retail investing. This gives us the opportunity to address a more diverse set of FinTech sectors in international. In cross-sell, a broader range of offerings to this customers. Our ability to rapidly identify the most attractive FinTech segments in markets within our international footprint and to effectively deploy our innovations like CreditVision, TruValidate, and Innovation Lab in these markets has helped us to build strong share positions just as we have in the U.S. Taken together, our U.S. and international FinTech positions represent a significant and fast growing part of our portfolio and should drive meaningful growth above the total company and segment rates in the years to come. Now I'd like to turn to our public sector vertical, which we formalized in 2015 to build off of a fledgling position that we had built more incidentally than deliberately. At that time, we had less than $10 million of government-related revenue spread across a number of our businesses but with no clear owner or strategy. Now, taking our assets and capabilities, we had a clear way to participate in this large attractive market, and in 2015 began the process of building out public sector as a stand-alone vertical utilizing our proven growth approach. First, we hired a dedicated leader, Jonathan McDonald, with deep industry expertise and gave him full P&L responsibility. Jonathan built up his team with dedicated government specialists from 19 associates in 2016 to 52 today. This team identified and prioritized the best opportunities for TransUnion which led to a two-pronged go-to-market strategy. The first part entailed identifying partners who could provide immediate access to various public sector business, allowing us to build the foundation and establish our brand. The second part involves playing the long game of gaining authorization to participate in government procurement processes directly to win business at the federal state and local level. Five years later, we've developed an impressive group of partners that help us access local state and federal opportunities and we've position ourselves to win business directly with all levels of government including higher education. Now, along with developing a market strategy, the team identified our existing solutions that could most readily fit this market need. In fact, we've never had to build a new solution specifically for public sector. We see that as a real positive that we can readily repurpose the assets within TransUnion and leverage them within a new vertical. This improves speed to market and lends itself to a higher-margin outcome as we don't have significant build-out cost. Now, while we've entered a number of areas, three solutions have driven a preponderance of our growth in the public sector. First, we leveraged our suite of thought in identity solutions to allow agencies to authenticate consumers interacting through existing online channels. Unsurprisingly, we saw significant surge at both the state and federal levels during the pandemic and demand continues today. We also see further opportunity as the Biden administration launches new programs to provide support to various constituents. Second, we utilized our broad array of powerful data assets delivered as a portfolio review for insider threat monitoring. Using this solution, we can help agencies that provide high-level security clearance, continuously monitor their workforce, and for any indication of financial distress or criminal activity as either can indicate heightened risk of an employee being compromised. And third, we combined our collection's prioritization tools and our leading industry insights around right party contact data to help states efficiently pursue parents who have failed to pay or continue to avoid paying child support obligations. This allows our customers to allocate the limited resources in the most effective way to maximize recovery of child support. All of this good work has resulted in rapid growth and we will approach $50 million in revenue this year. As we look forward with the clear path in this vertical to topping over $100 million in revenue. The next leg of growth will continue to leverage the approach I've just described and that starts with further penetration across the customer base as we built our reputation and develop a track record of delivering high impact solutions. We have positioned ourselves to bid on and win larger contracts and to connect business with states as well as new agencies at the state and federal level. We've also launched a professional services offering for our customers where our experts assist with integrating, onboarding and managing our solutions to ensure a quick and effective start to contracts as well as heightened customer satisfaction. And we've launched a supply chain risk solution, as many agencies worry about subcontractors or other vendors become a weak link in the security chain or smaller subcontractors going out of business. We've leveraged our market-leading linking and matching capabilities to develop solutions that support both national security and business continuity. And finally, we see an opportunity to help agencies that provide critical benefits to constituents, better market their availability to ensure that those in need of help receive it. To that end, we continue to explore leveraging the digital marketing capabilities that we've developed. So, the stories of consumer lending in the public sector illustrate two of the many growth vectors in TransUnion. And while they've realized exceptional growth, we have great conviction that they will continue to grow on a similar trajectory in the future, helping to fuel our long-term growth algorithm. And so with that, let me turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our financial results and our second quarter and full-year 2021 guidance. Todd? Thanks Todd. And to conclude this morning, we took you through a strong second quarter and a much more bullish outlook for the full year based on significantly strengthened macro trends across most of our markets. And we highlighted two large growing market positions that have helped propel TransUnion to best-in-class growth since our IPO and which we believe will allow us to remain on that growth path. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron. Yes, hey Manav good morning. This is Chris. It's really both areas. I mean, certainly we had accelerated our organic investments in new product development. We've built out talent under the umbrella of our Global Solutions organization focused on our key and common solutions that we offer across the full enterprise. We've increased the number of Scrum teams or technologies on our product development, and then we're accessing and investing in more data. In addition, as we have migrated, this global operating model and we're investing and improving different components of our operations, we've put more dollars toward our project to streamline and standardize our operational processes around the world and to implement a new state-of-the-art CRM and order management platform. We've boosted advertising in our direct-to-consumer business. And in general, we have also increased our technology investment outside of that which we add back related to project rise. Now, to the second part of your question, I mean, as you know, it's a very robust and active M&A market. We - as we say in every call, we continue to be engaged in the market evaluating different opportunities for TransUnion. And we'll be there as appropriate opportunities arise. I think Todd wanted to add a few things. Yes good question. So, for quite a few quarters now, we've commented on the strength of our new product sales in the U.S. and I believe, internationally too. And I guess, the short answer to the question is, they've been just as strong internationally as they have been in the U.S. As we said before, there is a great deal of sharing of sales practices and product positioning expertise and the like that takes place between the countries and the portfolio and the respective verticals, as well as our go-to-market sales discipline. I think we're looking to accommodate that strong products having vertical leaders who understand the industry and are tuned to the current needs of the market and continually investing to improve our go-to-market practices that's allowed us to notch a lot of sales wins. And again we talked, I think in the depth of the pandemic about how we launched Project Eliminate. The origins of that project actually began in the international markets, and then it became an enterprise-wide effort. So, we've had really good success, and I think you can see in our results that we're starting this year to show the revenue benefits of the wins that we notched last year. With all that said, Jeff, obviously, the rebound in the markets helps a lot. The strongest rebound we experienced was here in the U.S. That's a function of the availability of the vaccine. And as we've talked elsewhere, a lot of our international markets are in [technical difficulty] the pandemic and are now only beginning to recover. We think that's a good thing for us in the intermediate term. Yes. The short-term lenders would be a mix of the payday lenders, store front lenders, lenders that previously - the trade lines were aggregated by our FactorTrust business. The more down market, some title lending and the like. Yes. That's correct. Yes. So three parts to your question. We're having a touch of audio issues here the first part, were you asking regarding the exposure like the percentage of our portfolio revenue that is... [technical difficulty] it's differentiation. I mean, going back to the basics, right. The knowledge that we have regarding the composition of consumers' wallets their credits essentially as well as the public record and types we have by operating an investigated business based on public records in the U.S. gives us a great foundation for knowledge-based authentication, which is a traditional way of doing it. And we have tens of millions of dollars in business not only in the U.S., but around the world that we've developed over time. Today, using that as a foundation, we expanded through the acquisition of Trustev, but most importantly iovation and became one of the leading players in device-based authentication. We have seen billions of unique devices from almost every country around the world. And we have a reputational history [technical difficulty] which is shared across our network of consumers. Beyond that, we have invested and then added portfolio of fraud mitigation point solutions that we offer through our umbrella of TruValidate, which would include document uploading, fingerprint or biometric verification. The whole - the panoply of signals that comes into these fraud solutions ends up in an underlying data management layer where data scientist build fraud scoring and risk scoring algorithms. And then based on that we use our decisioning software to allow lenders to allow all types of clients to configure the actions they want to take based on the risk of an individual transaction. So net-net, it's the range of services from the traditional [technical difficulty] and just the scope of the solution on top of this integrated data layer that's really are differentiation. We feel that we're one of the most complete and global players out there in the market. Yes, the market is fragmented and we - look, there's a whole range of opportunity. The valuations are extremely high. We've got a great path to integrate and improve our current holdings through organic product development and we're investing in that. That said, we're constantly in the market. We're pursuing partnerships where appropriate. We would consider minority investments in capabilities that we feel are [technical difficulty] acquisition if we think it's going to drive growth and we can get a good return on. Yes. Okay. Gary, I understand the question. And I mean, look, obviously, I'm somewhat biased in this answer, but I'm pretty optimistic about the platform we've got in total. I've been a lot of different information services businesses. And one of the biggest keys to success is growth in the end user markets that you serve. So, I would just start there and say that, one thing I love about our business is that even in the oldest of our lines of business, there's still a heck of a lot of innovation and a lot of end user growth, and we're well positioned to service that. The second thing I would say is that, this platform of new products from vintages kind of have been - is still in the early to mid-stages of adoption. I would bet you, Gary, that if we're still around five years from now doing this, you and I will still be talking about trended data adoption across parts of our portfolio, right? And I guarantee you we'll be talking about the expansion of scope and currency and accuracy of a boatload of alternative datasets that are going to help us score more consumers around the globe and give lending and other business institutions better insights to manage their marketing spend, their risk appetites, their portfolios generally. On top of that, you see us - and we're not alone in this pushing more into technological delivery of these data and insights through solutions like Prama and others [technical difficulty] to support a wider range of our customers' workflows, their internal processes that are kind of industry standard that we can bring technological know-how and broader data and make these processes more standardized and more repeatable, right? So, I think those three things alone provide us with some really nice drivers of growth. On top of that, there's a lot of talent here that is motivated and incented to innovate and to grow based on the platform. We talk a lot about our growth playbook. We talk about the deep expertise we hold in the end user markets that we serve. That's going to produce new ideas and new innovation. And the fact that we're evolving our technology again through Project Rise means that we're going to be able to realize these ideas as new products faster and more flexibly than we think. And then on top of that, I would layer inorganic. Right? As Todd said, we've de-levered. We've got a healthy balance sheet. We have a clear strategy for growing and serving our customers, and they're going to be attractive opportunities that arise over this period that we will take advantage of. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So on the emerging verticals, I guess I'd start off just looking at our - at our full-year guidance for 2021. So we are expecting that business to be up in the low double digit range. And within my prepared remarks earlier, I rattled through just a lot of the really good momentum that we have in many of those markets. And Chris in particular spent time talking about public sector in his remarks, and so that's definitely an area of strength for us. Insurance continues to also be an area of outsized growth for us as well, which I highlighted. But [technical difficulty] of some of the other verticals that we're in like tenant and employment screening are showing a nice rebound as well as just some of the other diversified markets that we - that we operate in. So all-in-all, I would say that the verticals that make up these group are performing well. Now the only area right now is health care which I also talked about in my remarks in that business has been a little bit slower to recover than the other vertical markets. And that's just simply a product of how strained the health care system was during the pandemic. Many of hospitals - of providers were focused on COVID care, and they were not focused on more of the elective procedures as just patients were not comfortable getting into that setting. But as we indicated, within the front-end of our business start to pick up meaningfully. So - I mean, just as a reminder, the front-end think of products like insurance eligibility. So that means patients are back, right. So, the volumes are ticking up nicely in that space. Also, estimization of care as well too is another area that's strong. And what happens is there's a lag effect for the back end of the revenue cycle management, probably three to four months. And the back end of our healthcare business is truly where TransUnion is differentiated. And we are expecting that business to return to growth. So, the way and I - and then - and just to reiterate, what I again I said early on in call, the business had its highest amount of bookings in the [technical difficulty] this is isn't line. This is bookings, right. So I mean that just gives us a lot of optimism. So - and as I said, we expect the business to return to growth. So if I were to say that's the only vertical within the emerging that's really holding us back. But we're very optimistic about where this business is - the trajectory of it and what it's setting up for in Q3, Q4, but more importantly 2022. Yes. Good question as we see the acceleration of new COVID cases due to the Delta variant. Well, first of all, obviously its terrible development for the country given the wide availability of vaccines. I think 60% of the country has received at least one shot. But as you know, the rate of inoculations decelerated a lot and we still have a bit of a philosophical divide. Personally, I'm hoping we're going to bridge that divide. I think you see politically opinions are now consistent around the importance of getting vaccinations, and a lot of folks in a lot of rural areas have shied away from that. How that all factors into our GDP - into our guidance? It's not [technical difficulty] we're - that were currently - we don't currently believe we're going to have to alter our guidance as a result of this. We just think it's obviously an unfortunate thing for the country. And we hope it's the situation that starts to remedy itself in the weeks and near months ahead. Yes, sure Shlomo, let me unbundle that a little bit first, regarding the momentum in the business. I mean, clearly, the second quarter of 2021 reflects a step function improvement in the business due to underlying economic activity and some of our own market success. And I think we've detailed that quite a bit over the course of this conversation in our disclosure. Again, as Todd said that, I don't think the market rebound is done for us. And I think there's more gas in that in the U.S. and even more internationally given what said earlier about just the relative states of the pandemic in the different countries we serve. Now, pivoting to Washington, I mean yes, the current administration and various branches of government are keenly interested in providing consumer with accurate and accessible credit information that enables their participation in lending and the economy. And we're actively engaged in discussions explaining what we do, why it's accurate and effective, and how it supports the U.S. economy and the economies in the various markets that we serve. That said, their current philosophies, their positions about how to affect the best outcomes, where I think all parties are aligned is that we want to increase the scorable population by incorporating more sets of alternative data beyond traditional credit. The private sector, namely the three bureaus, because of market competition and desire for innovation, I believe have done a very good job in the recent years of expanding the pie of growing financial inclusion by migrating the trended data sets and incorporating a multitude of alternative data that is predictive of credit behavior. The other thing I feel the industry has done well is greatly broaden consumers' access to their credit information. And their ability to understand it, to dispute it to \u2013 and receive offers \u2013 financial offers based on it. But that said look, I expect to remain actively engaged explaining, advocating and just discussing with legislators and regulators alike about the right balance and the best solution to serve the American public. The other thing I would mention is with regard to the NO-A letter as we disclosed. We received a notice and opportunity to respond and advice regarding our position on our compliance with the 2017 consent order that we entered into. I believe that we are in compliance and we're looking forward to an opportunity to discuss this with the regulator. We're going to continue to cooperate. We're going to continue to collaborate. And we hope to have this matter behind us in a relative winter. Sure Ashish, you probably know this already, but there was an article that ran in the Wall Street Journal, I believe it was over the weekend or perhaps, I mean toward the end of last week, that I feel we did a good job covering the landscape of adoption of the VantageScore. So, I would refer you to that for some additional color beyond we'll share here. The reason for the increasing adoption of the VantageScore is that it works really well. It's based on the merger of the three bureaus' data, and it's been demonstrated time and again to score and score accurately the broadest number of consumers in the U.S. There have been a variety of obstacles to its full adoption. However, we for many years now, have said that Vantage is well, gaining broad acceptance typically in full flow management and also in direct-to-consumer offerings, but increasingly in loan origination. And I think the fact that the top five card issuer and \u2013 has adopted it for all loan origination as well as loan syndication, which was another barrier to acceptance. I think it's a powerful \u2013 as a powerful comment on the state of thinking amongst top issuers and top lenders. As that article pointed out, from the lender in question is not the only lender in the top five that has adopted innovative score for origination and there are other banks that are thinking hard about this or in the process of migrating to Vantage. Yes, look, starting there, we some time ago stood as a team to focus on charting our entry into this business. We there is a great opportunity to build a product and to migrate to the front of customer cascades during the origination process. We've struck relationships well one, a large payroll processor with financial account aggregators that get us access to deposit information. And the business development efforts to expand the breadth of our data archives are ongoing and will remain ongoing from this point forward, right. That said, as you know, we face a very large and entrenched competitor. We're not claiming at this point that our archives are as strong as theirs, certainly not. But they are competitive and we are winning some business, and we are super excited and putting a lot of wood behind this arrow, if you will. In terms of other data sets, as we've said previously, fraud is our second largest category worldwide. We think there's an enormous growth potential there. We're very interested in data around [technical difficulty] identifier, device reputation, e-commerce-related identifiers. And so, we're in the market both gathering those directly to our own tool sets, but also licensing in that type of data and integrating it into our identity graphs. So we are kind of matching logic."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope all of you remain safe and healthy. On the call today, we have Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ve posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations' website. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today\u2019s call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release and the comments made during the conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that said, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. Let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. At TransUnion, our associates continue to largely work from home and continue to demonstrate their ability to support the needs of our customers and consumers. I remain grateful for their efforts and commitment. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will discuss some of the broad macro and TransUnion specific trends that we experienced in the first quarter, and how they set the stage for a much stronger year than we previously anticipated. Next I will discuss our portfolio and strategies, which position us for high single-digit revenue growth at an attractive growing margin over the long-term. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first quarter results in detail along with second quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Let me start with our strong performance in the quarter. We significantly outperformed our guidance as we experienced a rapid recovery in many markets throughout February and March. Todd will discuss some of the specific revenue trends later as part of his remarks. But the takeaway is that we broadly saw trends improve across our business, consistent with the many improving macro indicators. Notably, according to a JPMorgan report, U.S. consumer spending accelerated during the first quarter, outpacing 2019 levels, and according to the labor department, unemployment fell to 6% a pandemic low. In March, small business owners felt the most optimistic since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Taking together these and many other salient points from the first quarter indicate the start of what we hope will be a long sustained economic recovery in the U.S. as Americans return to more normal work and social behavior. We\u2019ve seen similar trends in our key international markets. In the U.K., consumer confidence reached its highest level in a year, while income is expected to grow along with consumer spending in the coming quarters. In Canada, unemployment reached its lowest levels since March 2020. And consumer confidence hit pandemic era highs and in India reported unemployment dropped below pre-pandemic level, while consumer confidence and spending continue to recover. Like these metrics, our business improved as uncertainties resolved themselves positively. Business prospects improved and health concerns moderated. In short, the consumer is strengthened and businesses have regained confidence. For our business that led to a resurgence in demand for lending and new customer acquisition, resulting in improved non-mortgage performance in our financial services vertical even as the rate of mortgage growth slowed. Similarly, results accelerated as demand strengthened across our emerging verticals highlighted by double-digit growth in public sector, tenant and employment screening and media. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we saw better than expected performance as our direct business remain strong and declines in indirect channels moderated. We saw similar results in our international markets, with trends improving quarter-over-quarter in all our regions except the U.K. I would note that we continue to see the fragility of reopenings around the world, as evidenced by recent targeted lockdowns in Canada, lockdowns in almost all major cities in India, including Mumbai, and in parts of Colombia and elsewhere. This illustrates that recovery from the pandemic will be volatile and nonlinear, which we've attempted to accommodate in our financial outlook. Nonetheless, given our strong first quarter, and the more positive macro environment, we have substantially raised our full year 2021 guidance. Todd will provide you with the details later. Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high single-digit revenue growth at expanding attractive margins with double-digit EPS growth. Now I want to spend a few minutes on TransUnion's differentiated market position and approach which fuels this long-term growth algorithm. I've discussed these points on past earnings calls, but want to review them again as we continue to progress in each area. First, we have a track record of delivering outsized growth across the markets we serve through innovation and disruption leading to share gains. For example, in the U.S., we've grown rapidly in financial services due to our first mover advantage in trended and alternative data, which provides better credit insights for lenders and our deep understanding of their needs. This innovation and customer intimacy has helped us to grow much faster than the market as a whole. We also have developed deep partnerships with leading FinTech lenders positioning ourselves uniquely to grow, as ecommerce continues to disrupt traditional delivery of financial services. We've attacked in the insurance market by expanding from a credit and scores only position in personal auto underwriting into a broader set of solutions, serving multiple insurance, sub-verticals and use cases. And we've applied this approach of increasing breadth and depth of solutions in the healthcare and public sector verticals, and across the spectrum of diversified markets, such as telecommunications, ecommerce and tenant and employment screening. Most recently, we established media vertical and have won meaningful new relationships with partners such as Comscore, MediaMath and Blockgraph, which is owned by Comcast, Charter, and ViacomCBS. An earlier this month, we signed an agreement with OpenAP, a consortium of Fox, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS. We also announced earlier this month that we will extend our presence in the fast growing online gaming and gambling markets in the U.S. building our success in the U.K. In both cases, we provide valuable digital identity and fraud solutions to site operators to ensure they comply with local regulation and froth the efforts of fraudsters. Importantly, we will not offer solutions designed to extend credit to gamblers. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we engage consumers directly and indirectly through channel partnerships across industries, with solutions for personal financial management, identity protection and targeted credit offers. We established this attractive combined approach more than a decade ago by partnering with market leaders and benefiting from their growth. Recently, we've moved our direct-to-consumer business under our U.S. markets leader, Steve Chaouki. These two businesses can now combine the best of their offerings and pursue opportunities primarily in the indirect channel, where we help our customers serve consumers with engagement solutions, such as the CreditView dashboard. By closely aligning U.S. markets and consumer interactive, we can better leverage our combined capabilities. I will continue to share our progress as we develop this new strategy in our new organization. In addition to our attractive market positions, we have a proven and scalable enterprise playbook. Based on a foundation of customer and consumer insights, we've developed a repeatable approach to plant engagement, product innovation, and adjacency expansion. This approach fuels our ability to grow in excess often by multiples of a given underlying vertical or geographic market. In our recently established global solutions and global operations organizations, we will enhance and accelerate the use of our playbook across TransUnion. As an example of how this approach has produced meaningful results, I'll highlight the development of our insurance vertical in the U.S., which has substantially outgrown its underlying market. Historically, we focused on providing credit solutions to personal auto underwriters. Over time, we expanded systematically across the insurance value chain. Today, our offerings include fraud mitigation, customer acquisition, data prefill, underwriting assessment, policy renewal, analytics, collections and claims investigation. We've built a broad and differentiated position that is fueled many years of strong organic growth in the vertical. At the same time, we've entered adjacent insurance verticals using these solutions. From personal auto, we expanded into commercial auto bringing powerful driver insights. We also launched a data driven life insurance underwriting score, which we later extended to group life customers. And we also provide impactful solutions to assess the risk of apartment and condo buildings for commercial habitational insurers. All together, these innovations have enabled us to generate superior growth in our insurance vertical. In international, we've consistently utilized our growth playbook to outperform underlying markets regardless of their inherent growth rate. I want to use two examples of dramatically different markets India and Canada to illustrate the point. In India, we delivered a 32% revenue CAGR from 2016 to 2019. Now clearly, the underlying market grew rapidly during that time, perhaps low double-digits, suggesting that we outperformed by a factor of two to three times. We did that through thought leadership and by becoming a valued partner to the commercial banks, FinTech and government agencies that support lenders and consumers alike. We delivered a steady stream of innovation including CreditVision, CreditView, a powerful commercial credit score to validate in many other solutions. And we moved into adjacent markets including commercial credit, direct-to-consumer and insurance. In Canada, where we grew at a 12% CAGR from '16 through '19, our approach was much the same, but in a much more mature market. The underlying market likely grew in the low single digits and we outperformed by multiples. We did this again through thought leadership and close partnership with our customers. Our growth benefited from numerous centrally developed solutions that we leveraged in Canada, including CreditVision, CreditView, fraud mitigation, and Prama. We also extended into adjacent markets including insurance, public sector, and direct-to-consumer. The story repeats itself across verticals in geographic markets around the world. This approach allowed us to successfully enter new markets like the U.K., Colombia, in the Philippines, where our growth playbook enabled us to quickly deliver above market growth. We complement the growth playbook with powerful proprietary and third party data assets. In addition to our traditional attractive positions in consumer credit data, we've developed an array of alternative data assets to serve core and high growth used cases. I'll provide you with some significant examples, but not a comprehensive list. For lenders, we have trended credit payday and online short-term loans data, consumer contributed data through our MX partnership, and income and employment verification from the largest U.S. payroll processor. For fraud mitigation, we have a massive repository of device based fraudulent behavior that spans more than 15 years, and 8 billion devices from virtually every country in the world. We have access to public records from 1000s of sources delivered through TLOxp that powers investigative solutions used in virtually every one of our verticals. From our recent acquisition of Tru Optik, we have data on streaming devices and activity for more than 80 million U.S. households. In our insurance vertical, we offer a comprehensive driving violation data and state issued motor vehicle reports. And in our international markets, we have a similarly broad array of information including commercial credit data, public record data, and other alternative data, as well as differentiated data used by insurers in a number of countries. While we internally develop much of our data and analytics capabilities over these last eight years, we've also executed 20 acquisitions and a host of strategic partnerships that have meaningfully augmented our data assets and created value for our shareholders. And we continue to aggressively pursue new differentiated data assets. We also differentiate ourselves by how we manage the data entrusted to us. To that end, last week, we announced a preferred equity investment in and strategic cooperation with Spring Labs a leading financial technology firm transforming the exchange of sensitive data. Their advanced cryptography allows strict control of information visibility and their permission block chain provides a timestamp, immutable record and audit trail. Together, we can increase access to Spring Labs' data exchange network and products, while enabling us to expand protection of sensitive consumer data initially for fraud and identity verification. Our industry leading technology remains a competitive advantage. I've regularly discussed our track record of delivering on large scale complex technology initiative, as well as project rise, our current program to make TransUnion's technology more scalable, secure, efficient, and effective. So I won't recount them here. Project rise keeps us on the cutting edge of cloud computing and information security, and remains on plans to deliver considerable operational and financial benefits. As we achieve key milestones in the program, we'll continue to provide you with updates. Now underpinning these market positions, our culture is rooted in customer focus and partnership. We've built a company that understands the needs of the customers it serves and can deliver best-in-class solutions to meet those needs. We also balanced the sense of humility with a deep inner drive to be successful and accountable, while also taking the collaborative approach both internally and externally. As a result, we have built a track record of winning in the marketplace and delivering superior results. And our success in growth has allowed us to hire extremely high caliber talent across the organization. At the same time, our culture has always embraced diversity, equity and inclusion. Over the past year that has taken increased importance as we've witnessed an unprecedented wave of social activism aimed at remediating the historical injustices inflicted on minority populations. I've spoken before about our task force for racial equity, which continues to make progress. Most recently, we hired an experienced executive to lead our supplier diversity efforts and join three nonprofit organizations, which serve as chambers of commerce for diverse end businesses. I'll highlight a few other items relevant to this work. First, you can read in our most recent proxy about our Board's decision to link a component of our executive team's compensation to diversity hirings and promotions. Second, I'd encourage you to read our recently published diversity report, which highlights the good work that we're doing to create a more inclusive and diverse employee base. I was pleased to see that over the past year, we increased our percentage of global female leaders from 27% to 30%, a solid improvement, although we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our goal of gender parity at all levels. Third, in our sustainability report, you'll see that we have embraced the FASB and [indiscernible] reporting frameworks, along with making significant progress on all three dimensions of ESG. And finally, I would like to say equivocally that TransUnion stands in opposition to the surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. These actions are deplorable and unacceptable in any form. Now this morning, I've laid out TransUnion's differentiated market and portfolio positioning that has enabled industry leading growth since our IPO. I fully expect the same differentiators in which we continue to invest aggressively to fuel strong performance over the years to come. Now with that, let me turn over baton to Todd to walk you through our financial results and our second quarter and full-year 2021 guidance, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. I want to start by building on Chris's commentary about the accelerated recovery we experienced in the middle of the quarter. This slide shows monthly year-over-year revenue growth for all our reported segments, verticals and geographies. With only a few minor exceptions, you can see a clear inflection over the course of the quarter, reflecting the positive macro dynamics that Chris highlighted. I will note that while total financial services shows relatively consistent monthly growth rates, if you look at the non-mortgage business, it progressed from down mid single-digits in January, two up strong double-digits in March. This timing had a significant impact on how we guided the quarter and the full year on February 16 compared to the actual results we delivered in the quarter, and the revised guidance that I'll share with you shortly. When we built our forecasts for the 2020 year-end earnings call, we had seen actuals for January, and heard limited incrementally positive comments from our customers. Macro indicators still hadn't definitively flipped to more positive trajectories that all changed in the middle of the quarter. More specifically with February's results, we gained additional conviction in the outlook. And March came in substantially better than we would have expected based on all the information we had in early February. As we've always stressed, we want to provide guidance that is based on the best available data and what we have line of sight to which is exactly what we did in February. And that's what we're going to do again this quarter by raising full year guidance based on a more constructive view of our markets supported by concrete, macro indicators, and clear signal from our customers. With that context in place, I'll start my review with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the first quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Starting with the income statement, first quarter consolidated revenue increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. The signal and Tru Optik acquisition had just under one point of impact, so organic constant currency growth to 7%. Excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.3% up 200 basis points, compared with a year ago quarter driven primarily by the significant revenue outperformance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 25%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth, to benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancings, prepayments and lower LIBOR rates, as well as a slightly lower adjusted tax rate of 22.8%. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets revenue was up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had about one point of impact on revenue. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue would have grown 4%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 16% as reported, and 17% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 180 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth and offset partially by our continued strategic and operational investments, and the class to integrate and scale our recent media acquisition. Diving into the results by vertical, financial services revenue grew 14% and was up 5% excluding mortgage, notably, consumer lending, auto and credit card each improved over the course of the quarter, while the growth rate and mortgage as expected began to slow. As Chris discussed, we have seen improvement in most of our end markets, and we are well positioned to see an outsize benefit from this recovery. That view comes from a number of factors including our strong position with FinTech players and their expansion into new lending markets like credit card, and buy now pay later, as well as accelerated customer adoption and usage of CreditVision, as it provides unique insight in the consumers in a post pandemic lending market and our continued success winning business. Looking at the individual end markets, in consumer lending, lenders and our investors are primed to resume more aggressive customer acquisition though their plans were somewhat delayed as the quarter began, and ended with a stimulus check for more consumers. In auto, markets surged in March on the strength of another round of stimulus that further strengthened consumers\u2019 personal balance sheets. While there is some disruption to the OEM production from the well publicized chip shortage, we've seen a shift to use car purchase, which is an area of strength for our business. And in card, we've seen an increase in marketing activity and expect that to continue as we progress through the year. And for mortgage, we now expect the market to be roughly flat, instead of down 10% in 2021, as we previously shared. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 7% on a reported basis, and 4% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. As Chris discussed, we experienced generally improved trends across almost all of these verticals led by double-digit organic growth in public sector, tenant and employment screening, and media. Public sector remains a very strong growth vector for TransUnion as we benefit from work from home trends in certain new programs being advanced by the Biden administration. At both the federal and state level, we continue to see significant growth in the fraud and identity space as agencies administer additional programs to provide support to their constituents during the pandemic. In tenant and employment screening, we saw a modest improvement in employment screening, while our tenant screening solutions continue to deliver strong revenue growth behind key partnerships and accelerated usage of our smart move solution. And our media vertical continues to deliver attractive growth, while also inking new customers as Chris highlighted. We're pleased the momentum and scale we've developed in this vertical, as our recent acquisitions are tracking to our expectations. We also saw insurance continue to deliver growth driven in part by improving market trends, but even more so by the strength of our sales efforts, and customer adoption of our innovative solutions like DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, CreditVision, Prefill and TruValidate. Finally, our healthcare vertical revenue was down slightly, but showed improvement compared to recent pandemic impacted quarters. In particular, we are seeing continued growth in front end patient visit volumes, suggesting people are gaining comfort with returning to healthcare venues. As vaccines are administered more broadly, we believe this trend will continue to improve. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA was up 2% as we continue to increase marketing in the direct channel during the quarter. That marketing helps drive double-digit revenue growth in our direct business, and a solid increase in our subscriber base. Consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Our team is also beginning to engage the sophisticated people based marketing solutions we've developed through our recent acquisitions. Given their efficacy, we believe they will help our direct business deliver solid growth in the years to come. Our indirect channel remains soft as financial products lead aggregators saw modest improvement over the course of the quarter. As we've seen lenders increase marketing intensity, we would expect that to provide some incremental benefit to our business as the year progresses, and subscriber bases are rebuilt. For our comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 3% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions, adjusted EBITDA for international increased 16%. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue declined 5% though trends improved considerably over the course of the quarter as the country has moved closer to being fully reopened. We continue to see strength in our fraud and online gaming businesses. And while the lending market remains depressed relative to pre-COVID levels, we are seeing encouraging signs from lenders. While we also benefit from a strong position with the fast growing buy now pay later players. Our Canadian business grew 9% in the first quarter, while key end markets like lending neared pre-pandemic activity levels. We generated growth from the portfolio diversification that we've intentionally developed, including insurance, direct-to-consumer offerings, and the emerging FinTech space. In India, we grew 11% as the country has largely reopened, though with the caveat that the situation there has worsened significantly in recent weeks, highlighting just how fragile some markets remain. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio including commercial credit scoring, fraud mitigation solutions, direct-to-consumer and government sponsored programs to assist lenders through the pandemic. In Latin America, revenue was up 5% on the strength of double-digit growth in our two largest markets, Colombia, and Brazil. Many of the smaller countries in Central America continue to see sharp declines as customers, consumers and governments navigate the challenges of the pandemic. In Asia Pacific, we grew 5% and continued recovery in our largest market, Hong Kong. There, we are seeing very positive momentum with our relaunched direct-to-consumer offering and are beginning to pursue more indirect partnerships. The Philippines remains very challenging and our current expectation is for a highly delayed recovery. Finally, Africa declined 5%. In our largest market, South Africa, the economy remains challenged and vaccination rollout has been slow. Based on recent market wins though, we do expect continue improvement in revenue as the year progresses. One of the many strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $433 million of cash on the balance sheet after voluntarily prepaying $85 million of our term loans. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continues to decline from 2.8 times at the end of the fourth quarter to 2.7 times at the end of March. With our strong balance sheet, we remained in a good position to continue to proactively pursue additional attractive investments, which remain an important part of our long-term growth strategy. That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Starting with second quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than one point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik, as well as a two-point tailwind to revenue from FX. And we expect two points of benefit to adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue is expected to come in between $744 million and $754 million or a 17% to 19% increase, reflecting the improved macro-environment and very easy second quarter 2020 comparables. This results in organic constant currency revenue growth being up 15% to 16%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate two-point headwind from mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $296 million and $303 million an increase of 22% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.89 and $0.92, an increase of 35% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and one-point of tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $2.949 billion to $2.992 billion, up 9% to 10%. Our guidance includes 1 to 1.5 points of headwind for mortgage reflecting the fact that we only expect mortgage to be a tailwind in the first quarter, and that it will be progressively more challenging in the remaining three quarters. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow revenue high single digits, financial services to be up high single digits and emerging verticals to be up low double digits. Excluding impacted mortgage, U.S. markets would be up low double digits and financial services would be up low double digits as well. We anticipate that international will grow mid-teens on an as reported basis as we continue to see a varied pace of recovery across our markets. And we expect consumer interactive to be of low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.157 billion and $1.189 billion up 11% to 14%. We expect one point benefit from FX. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 80 to 130 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year expected to be between $3.45 and $3.58, up 15% to 19%. At this time, we have no material updates to our other guidance items like tax rate, DNA, interest expense, and capital expenditures. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Todd. And to conclude this morning, we took you through a strong first quarter and a much more bullish outlook for the full-year based on significantly stronger macro trends across most of our markets. And we've discussed the differentiated portfolio market positions that have propelled TransUnion to best-in-class growth since our IPO, and that we believe will allow us to remain on this path in the future. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. As always for the Q&A, we ask - that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And now we'll be glad to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Good morning, gentlemen. And thank you for all that color. I was just hoping you guys could give us some more color on your FinTech vertical. It was obviously a very fast growing area before it did get hit during the pandemic. I was just wondering if you give us some anecdotal color on what that pace of recovery and outlook looks like today?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure Manav. Todd and I'll tag team on this one. But first, I would say that the consumer lending sub vertical was in financial services was one of the components of our business that strengthened month over month during the quarter, and that we expect will continue to benefit from the recovery. And of course, the FinTech players are material components of consumer lending. And generally we see strengthening there, we see an increased interest in new customer acquisition, which is terrific. And again, the longer-term we feel like e-commerce is going to become increasingly important to the delivery of financial services and we're very grateful for the partnership we have with so many of the players in that space, but generally speaking, I'd say it's a strengthening component of the portfolio that should benefit us in the quarters ahead. And so, Todd, anything you want to add to that?\nTodd Cello: Yes, that's for sure. Chris said, I definitely would add to that, that we are in the FinTech players expand into new lending markets like credit card and especially the buy now pay later segment, which we've got a meaningful position and as well too. In addition, the story that we've told about how we won, share with FinTech with accelerated adoption and usage of our CreditVision suite of products continues to hold true as well with this customer group, as they enter into new markets. So we're very encouraged and excited about the potential with the Fintech\u2019s for the remainder of the year.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, and then I would just add, as we've talked about in other calls, the FinTech space has been more stable during this downturn than many expected. And we've seen funding begin to flow back in a substantial way to the space. So it's all very encouraging. Next question?\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: So I am going to ask two questions. When looking at Slide 11, I just wanted to make sure for the U.K. line that you felt the revenue declines in the quarter would just related to the lockdowns. Obviously, I saw the plus seven in the month of March and wanted to hear how cross-selling TrueVision and CreditView are going in the U.K. Secondly, I also wanted to know if you want to give us kind of the percentage of revenues for the U.S. financial services, revenues, card, mortgage, fee loan, et cetera?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I'll leave that second question Andrew to Todd. But I will say, obviously, the U.K. has been very hard hit by COVID and the lockdowns had a negative impact on our business. We also just have some revenue lumpiness in the quarter, because we had a very large piece of business, a non-recurring business last January. And so that exacerbated the decline. What I'll say about TrueVision is that there has been a lot of interest in the product since we introduced it. We generated some revenue last year on a whole variety of customer pilots. We've built a very nice pipeline and we're beginning to convert into recurring revenue some of the banks that are part of that pipeline. So I would say, TrueVision penetration in the U.K. is encouraging and it's very much following the path that we experienced in the U.S. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. Hi, Andrew, just to finish off the question on the U.K., I mean that first of all kind of open up the quarter a little bit right, and show you what the trends look like by month, so a couple of things that are important. In January, we had a comparison to the prior year where we had a large onetime prior year deal in there. And then also you may recall that in January of 2020, that was the last month that we recorded revenue for business we divested by the name of Recipero. So if you exclude those two items, the U.K. actually would have been down mid-single digits in January. But typically, these are things we would never talk about, because we don't show the monthly trends and you would have just seen the quarterly number, but hopefully that that provides the context that you need. As it pertains to your second question about percentage breakouts of the end lending markets and financial services. What I can tell you is mortgage in particular on a trailing 12-month basis revenues were about 13% of total TransUnion mortgage. At this time, Andrew, we are not providing the details on auto, card and consumer lending. So probably that gives you enough - with mortgage.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Chris, as you refresh this, I guess on the growth playbook just wanted to revisit Prama, which was I guess an area that investors were optimistic about, a few years ago, it seemed to fade a bit to the background. So interested when it got a recent call out at an investor conference, and then again this morning as it relates to Canada. So I guess the question is, is Prama starting to gain more traction as part of the broader ongoing business win that you\u2019re talking about. Thanks?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good question. I mean, look Prama remains a vital part of our new product offerings, and I'd say technology integration with our clients if you will. And we continue to invest materially in the product not only because it represents a new revenue stream for us as we mature the feature functionality, and we increasingly license it across the markets that we serve. But I think Prama and tools such as Prama are going to become more a supporting way of engaging with the marketplace. They provide direct access to the range of information that TransUnion and other bureaus provide, a lot of analytic and modeling technology, the ability to upload and append other types of information or unique financial institution information with the other data the TransUnion provides, the ability to place orders and monitor the status of the orders. And so it's a new interface layer to the range of services that the industry provides that we'll be building out over time. And we think it's going to provide uplift on revenues, one through direct licensing, but also really through improved utilization, and increased stickiness with our customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead. \nGary Bisbee: Todd. I think I heard you say your guidance now implies mortgage flat for the year versus the prior down. Since you last reported, industry trends have clearly deteriorated. So can you help us understand like what you mean or why you now see it that way? And then it's part two of the question. I guess that would be a portion if I heard that right of the improvement in the guidance, but it seems like a smaller portion, can you just sort of give us a sense of what are two or three of the key areas that have improved most since you last provided the initial outlook for the year. Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Hi, Gary, thanks for the question. Obviously an important one for us to go through this morning. So we are starting with our assumption around mortgage. First, in our February earnings call, we did call for a 10% year-over-year decline. And I think what we saw happen in the first quarter, his mortgage actually continued to perform relatively well, albeit though, we did start to see the year-over-year growth rates start to taper off throughout the quarter as the comparison obviously gets significantly more difficult, because if you think back to March of 2020, that's really when mortgage took off on significantly when interest rates plummeted. So that's definitely, a part of it is that the Q1 performance was definitely stronger in my opening remarks, hopefully, I provided the necessary context on what our business would have grown with and without on the mortgage contribution. So as we extrapolate mortgage out for the remainder of the year, I think we had a little bit more of a pessimistic thought about what was going to happen and I think what we're seeing is the market is relatively holding in particular with refinance, but also know we continue to see a good activity on the purchase side of things. So with that being said if you just dive a little bit more into mortgage, what we talked about for Q1, as we said that, we had a 3% benefit, in the quarter from mortgage. And the guide that we\u2019re providing for the second quarter calls for a 2% headwind. So now we're starting to run into the comparables. And for the full year, we're calling for a 1% to a 1.5% on headwind. So if you just do the math, and kind of come up with okay well, what's going to happen in the second half of the year, we were anticipating to be down about 3% in mortgage. So there is definitely a tapering forthcoming. I think what's more instructive though, about our outlook and the portfolio of businesses that TransUnion has is, everything else that we're anticipating to recover in the second quarter and into the second half. In particular, financial services if exclude mortgage completely, we're talking about expectations of low double-digit growth. So that comes across all the other verticals - and lending markets, like auto, consumer and consumer lending, and bank and card so obviously, strong recovery there. In our emerging verticals, similar story, we\u2019re expecting low double-digit growth throughout - as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. So think about when I talked about with public sector and insurance and media, all performing very well. Our healthcare vertical, a little bit slower to recover, but nevertheless, they are. So we're expecting that in the second half of the year. But if you look at the emerging verticals, and excluded healthcare at low double-digits, would be up mid double-digits, so a lot of strength, that we're anticipating in the emerging verticals. Our international business, expecting mid-teens growth on a reported basis now there is, you know again, in my prepared remarks I laid out the caveats. I mean, there's clearly some unfortunate news coming out of India, as cases surge, as well as I mean other geographies that changing and operates in like Brazil, and even Canada, for example. So the recovery there won't necessarily be linear. And then finally, I'd say that, the consumer interactive business we\u2019re expecting low single-digit growth from that business as well. So all in all across the portfolio I feel, I think Chris, and I both feel very confident about what's taking hold.\nChris Cartwright: Yes Todd look, that's great color. And I appreciate the breakdown. The one small thing I find out on mortgage is that, we're incredibly focused on this as well forecasts will no doubt vary great. But as the rates have increased, and that has impacted the business, mortgage lenders are still very busy. There's a tremendous amount of work in process. And there's also they've been operating on a generous spread. And as we talked about in prior calls, there's the opportunity to cut into that spread in order to stimulate further demand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nHamzah Mazari: My question is just around a little more around the playbook that you guys articulated, which had great color, specifically on the media and digital ad offering. Could you maybe talk about how differentiated that offering is, what the competitive set looks like there? And then, do you continue to expect to scale this up through M&A just given the leverage today, is at an all time low for you?\nChris Cartwright: Yes thank you for the, thanks for the question. Yes, as we talked about for quite some time now. We think that the media and digital marketplaces will benefit from the precise matching logic and high data quality that TransUnion can bring. We have claim of scenes for many years now fueled the matching append operations of different players in this ecosystem. There is a slightly different set of players. And so, we decided to formalize it and enter you know, initially well obviously, we bring a lot of quality data sets. And as I mentioned, our match logic is very powerful given the core credit markets that we serve and more recently, we did acquisitions to acquire underlying data management technologies that allow us to bring together the range of data that we have in our match logic in a very user friendly way, where digital marketers can generate audiences on the fly. Also, recent acquisitions have brought us data and insights, as to which households are subscribing to various streaming services, both audio and video streaming services, which is letting which will allow advertisers to tap a really rapidly growing marketplace that does not have the same level of insights or add precision that the rest of the marketplace has. So, we've just bought a couple of businesses and Tru Optik and Signal, and we're merging them into our existing operations. We find the management team. We're doing product integration, integration on a variety of levels. And we're building out, are selling our products support, our product integration, and our platform integration activities, quite materially, that's going to continue to be a focus. It's an area where, we expect to have higher than average earnings for the foreseeable future. And we think it's a large end market that it can mature into one of our larger emerging verticals over time. And certainly, we're open to M&A to add additional capabilities as we see fit.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to start by saying I appreciate the strength and acceleration from January to March. But you mentioned the non-mortgage financial services growth of 5%, which is below what your closest competitor reported in the quarter of 11% organically. And I'm sure you have some ideas on what you think is driving the delta? Just want to know if you think it's tough - you had a tougher comp or is there a mix component here, or is it a sign that environment is just getting a little bit more competitive for you - just or anything else? So I just wanted to give you a chance to explain your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Toni, this is Todd sorry about the background noise there. As it pertains to the comparison to the prior year for our non-mortgage financial services business, I think what you know couple of things. First the financial services, the mortgage piece did, the growth did decelerate as - I've already said. We have seen a good recovery in many of our end markets like auto, which I talked about in my prepared remarks, that that was an area of particular strength for us. Card and banking and consumer lending, I would say I mean it's really the areas where, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, perhaps the growth rate isn't as strong. And a significant part of that is, you can't forget that Q1 of 2020 was a relatively strong quarter for us. We were not heavily impacted by the pandemic it was only about two weeks on it particular in the U.S. So if you think back to that period of time, the performance that we were seeing from our FinTech customers was exceptionally strong last year. So we're comping against that. And as I already said, our position with the FinTech\u2019s is an area that we're incredibly proud of. And we've got deep relationships with these customers. So again, as I answered in previous question, these guys are branching into, new businesses, and we're right there partnering with them. So they're a little bit slower to recover in the first quarter because of that comparison, but I think what's more instructive is what's ahead. And then that's really where we get into, just you know the opportunity of low double-digit growth in financial services, ex mortgage that space is a big part of that. Other thing to that I'd throw out there on FinTech side is, there's a lot of consumer lending that goes on in that space. Don't forget about two stimulus checks arrived for many consumers in the quarter, one early January and another one when quarter ended. So demand might not necessarily have been as strong as it has in the past. The other part that to I spent a lot talking about FinTech the other part though, is our bank and credit card business. Again, we were comparing against some really good growth in the prior year and the strength of credit card marketing activity that was pretty good in Q1 of 2020. And that business is now starting to recover as our customers are going to start fighting for wallet share with potential travel and dining out, picking up so we started to see that as well. So that's also just another part about the future that I think is important.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good color Todd and look, I would just boil it down to this Toni, the engine is firing on all cylinders in Q1 of 2020 with the exception of the last two months of March when the lockdowns occurred. And I mean look - the non-mortgage portion of financial services grew 14% in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we're now posting growth over that high level of growth, and I would guess that was probably a high watermark for our business, is just really encouraging going forward. And I think you're going to see that growth rate and that spread accelerate against the easier comps that we say in certainly Q2, but also Q3 and Q4.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate taking the question guys. I think TransUnion has a particularly enviable position in fraud and ID, which you highlighted. Chris, can you talk about whether you think there's any sort of pandemic affected demand in those horizontal offerings or is that also sort of more digitally structural I guess driven by pandemic just trying to get a sense of where the puts and takes are on reopening of it?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I'm not sure about the dynamic specifically related to reopening. But look as we all know, the pandemic resulting in the lockdowns was an enormous ecommerce forcing mechanism. And ecommerce penetration worldwide grew by multiples, right. And that has caused I think a structural change in consumer behavior. And then all of - that's just an increase in anonymous digital transactions, which require increasingly sophisticated identity and authentication. That's where I think our portfolio is well positioned because of the historic strengths that we've got, because we know a lot about individual consumers and can vary them. And we have sophisticated fraud propensity models, but we've also infused this with just gobs of digital information from iovation that's collected from almost every country in the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kevin Mcveigh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nKevin Mcveigh: Great, thank you and congratulations. Hey Chris and Todd. Just wanted some question around framing the recovery relative to prior cycles and just, feel like you're better position given the pace of disruption as we're coming out of this season. The way to think about how that it can impact the revenue growth longer term, particularly the positioning at FinTech as it becomes more pervasive across the enterprise? And if there's any frame is it the incremental growth and margin profile of the business as you're seeing on the FinTech opportunity given the pace of disruption?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, good question. And I agree that we are well positioned coming out of this pandemic, recovery and I mean it feels a bit premature, to sit back given what's going on in some of our international markets in particular India and Brazil. But things are substantially better in the U.S. The vaccines are highly available the vaccination rates are substantially improving and in stages and have turned back towards the normal and consumption and that's really fitting our business. As Todd mentioned, the benefits are in almost every vertical across our portfolio in the U.S. with the exceptions of mortgage, which is going to face headwinds for a couple of years because the air is going to get let out of that balloon if you will that was caused by the low interest rates. And also, it's going to take some more orders for our healthcare business to return and to grow - find everybody that, in the first quarter of 2020 the healthcare business grew organically 9%. And we'd really kind of return to the targets that we expected and in particular during this pandemic. But look, the portfolio is still not firing on all cylinders. But I do think it's positioned for meaningful recovery quarter-by-quarter, as we re-emerge from this. I think you're going to see and acceleration in financial services from the non-mortgage verticals. I think the emerging markets are in the U.S. are particularly - the emerging verticals that is, are particularly going to accelerate. In the direct-to-consumer business, as lenders become more focused on new customer acquisition, our indirect channel will again become a strength, a differentiator that's going to propel further growth. And again, I'll remind everyone that in the couple of - in the few years prior to this pandemic, our international portfolio was growing at 12% to 15% organically, right. And it was a real strength within our enterprise. We grew 3% in the first quarter. And while that is a substantial improvement, look there is a lot of just inherent organic growth across that portfolio given that we serve emerging markets, growing middle classes, and increasing financial penetration, it's just those markets are grappling with COVID right now. But again, as vaccines rollout, and as we approach herd immunity in different markets, it's going to have a significantly beneficial impact on our results.\nOperator: The next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Hey Todd, I thought I just kind of asked you about a little bit of the organic growth expectation for the year. Is there some way you can parse it and if it\u2019s not quantitatively, may be qualitatively in terms of the economic recovery boost versus kind of a company getting back to aggressively being able to drive the sales from internal initiatives? Just trying to figure out how you guys are looking at that internally? How much is going to just be the boost from the economic recovery and how much is we're getting back on our front foot again?\nChris Cartwright: Hi, Shlomo. Thanks for the question. And yes, it's obviously a good one to ask, because so much of the focus is on economic recovery, which undoubtedly does benefit TransUnion. But I would say that, if you were to look back over the last year, and we were to look at our portfolios and say - our pipeline of sales deals in the March timeframe. It was for deals to help our customers continue to grow their business, because that was the mode that they were in at that period of time. And it was remarkable how quickly our sales force pivoted to what was a new expectation from our customers to help them manage their existing portfolio. So if you were to look at our pipeline in May of last year, it drastically changed. And the reason I tell you that is it's just the expertise that we have in our sales force and understanding the customer's needs. But more importantly, how we are able to pivot not just sales, but the team supporting sales all of our - all the products and our performing teams to start to deliver products that are relevant for the customer at that time and we did that last year. And we reacted and we continued to win a significant amount of business throughout the remainder of 2020. As you move into the first quarter of this year, it's again, kind of remarkable how that pipeline turns over again. And you've heard us in our commentary talk about our customers looking to acquire again and start to market. So that pipeline has again changed, and it's changing for a different market that we've adapted to. So when we look and we provide guidance for the full year, we're not only just taking into consideration the macro factors, but we're also taking a look at the deals that the team has won and that's factored in here. So Shlomo I can't give you the precise breakdowns, but I think what's important is pipeline is robust. Our sales force is executing and we're winning. And it's really again driven by the superior product innovation that TransUnion has that arguably makes our sales teams very effective in the marketplace.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Aaron Hoffman for any closing remarks.\nAaron Hoffman: Great, I'll just thank everyone for joining us today. And I hope that you have a wonderful rest of the day. We look forward to speaking with many of you over the course of the quarter. Have a good day. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I want to start by building on Chris's commentary about the accelerated recovery we experienced in the middle of the quarter. This slide shows monthly year-over-year revenue growth for all our reported segments, verticals and geographies. With only a few minor exceptions, you can see a clear inflection over the course of the quarter, reflecting the positive macro dynamics that Chris highlighted. I will note that while total financial services shows relatively consistent monthly growth rates, if you look at the non-mortgage business, it progressed from down mid single-digits in January, two up strong double-digits in March. This timing had a significant impact on how we guided the quarter and the full year on February 16 compared to the actual results we delivered in the quarter, and the revised guidance that I'll share with you shortly. When we built our forecasts for the 2020 year-end earnings call, we had seen actuals for January, and heard limited incrementally positive comments from our customers. Macro indicators still hadn't definitively flipped to more positive trajectories that all changed in the middle of the quarter. More specifically with February's results, we gained additional conviction in the outlook. And March came in substantially better than we would have expected based on all the information we had in early February. As we've always stressed, we want to provide guidance that is based on the best available data and what we have line of sight to which is exactly what we did in February. And that's what we're going to do again this quarter by raising full year guidance based on a more constructive view of our markets supported by concrete, macro indicators, and clear signal from our customers. With that context in place, I'll start my review with our consolidated results. And for the sake of simplicity, all of the comparisons I discussed today will be against the first quarter of 2020 unless noted otherwise. Starting with the income statement, first quarter consolidated revenue increased 8% on a reported and constant currency basis. The signal and Tru Optik acquisition had just under one point of impact, so organic constant currency growth to 7%. Excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2020 and 2021, our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and 13% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.3% up 200 basis points, compared with a year ago quarter driven primarily by the significant revenue outperformance. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 25%. This was largely driven by strong adjusted EBITDA growth, to benefit from reduced interest expense related to our debt refinancings, prepayments and lower LIBOR rates, as well as a slightly lower adjusted tax rate of 22.8%. Now looking at segment financial performance, U.S. markets revenue was up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The two media acquisitions had about one point of impact on revenue. Excluding mortgage, organic revenue would have grown 4%. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 16% as reported, and 17% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 180 basis points, largely as a result of the strong revenue growth and offset partially by our continued strategic and operational investments, and the class to integrate and scale our recent media acquisition. Diving into the results by vertical, financial services revenue grew 14% and was up 5% excluding mortgage, notably, consumer lending, auto and credit card each improved over the course of the quarter, while the growth rate and mortgage as expected began to slow. As Chris discussed, we have seen improvement in most of our end markets, and we are well positioned to see an outsize benefit from this recovery. That view comes from a number of factors including our strong position with FinTech players and their expansion into new lending markets like credit card, and buy now pay later, as well as accelerated customer adoption and usage of CreditVision, as it provides unique insight in the consumers in a post pandemic lending market and our continued success winning business. Looking at the individual end markets, in consumer lending, lenders and our investors are primed to resume more aggressive customer acquisition though their plans were somewhat delayed as the quarter began, and ended with a stimulus check for more consumers. In auto, markets surged in March on the strength of another round of stimulus that further strengthened consumers' personal balance sheets. While there is some disruption to the OEM production from the well publicized chip shortage, we've seen a shift to use car purchase, which is an area of strength for our business. And in card, we've seen an increase in marketing activity and expect that to continue as we progress through the year. And for mortgage, we now expect the market to be roughly flat, instead of down 10% in 2021, as we previously shared. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 7% on a reported basis, and 4% excluding the revenue associated with the two media vertical acquisitions. As Chris discussed, we experienced generally improved trends across almost all of these verticals led by double-digit organic growth in public sector, tenant and employment screening, and media. Public sector remains a very strong growth vector for TransUnion as we benefit from work from home trends in certain new programs being advanced by the Biden administration. At both the federal and state level, we continue to see significant growth in the fraud and identity space as agencies administer additional programs to provide support to their constituents during the pandemic. In tenant and employment screening, we saw a modest improvement in employment screening, while our tenant screening solutions continue to deliver strong revenue growth behind key partnerships and accelerated usage of our smart move solution. And our media vertical continues to deliver attractive growth, while also inking new customers as Chris highlighted. We're pleased the momentum and scale we've developed in this vertical, as our recent acquisitions are tracking to our expectations. We also saw insurance continue to deliver growth driven in part by improving market trends, but even more so by the strength of our sales efforts, and customer adoption of our innovative solutions like DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, CreditVision, Prefill and TruValidate. Finally, our healthcare vertical revenue was down slightly, but showed improvement compared to recent pandemic impacted quarters. In particular, we are seeing continued growth in front end patient visit volumes, suggesting people are gaining comfort with returning to healthcare venues. As vaccines are administered more broadly, we believe this trend will continue to improve. Consumer Interactive revenue increased 3% driven by growth in the direct channel. Adjusted EBITDA was up 2% as we continue to increase marketing in the direct channel during the quarter. That marketing helps drive double-digit revenue growth in our direct business, and a solid increase in our subscriber base. Consumers value our credit health and identity protection services. Our team is also beginning to engage the sophisticated people based marketing solutions we've developed through our recent acquisitions. Given their efficacy, we believe they will help our direct business deliver solid growth in the years to come. Our indirect channel remains soft as financial products lead aggregators saw modest improvement over the course of the quarter. As we've seen lenders increase marketing intensity, we would expect that to provide some incremental benefit to our business as the year progresses, and subscriber bases are rebuilt. For our comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 3% as we saw trends improve in most of our regions, adjusted EBITDA for international increased 16%. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue declined 5% though trends improved considerably over the course of the quarter as the country has moved closer to being fully reopened. We continue to see strength in our fraud and online gaming businesses. And while the lending market remains depressed relative to pre-COVID levels, we are seeing encouraging signs from lenders. While we also benefit from a strong position with the fast growing buy now pay later players. Our Canadian business grew 9% in the first quarter, while key end markets like lending neared pre-pandemic activity levels. We generated growth from the portfolio diversification that we've intentionally developed, including insurance, direct-to-consumer offerings, and the emerging FinTech space. In India, we grew 11% as the country has largely reopened, though with the caveat that the situation there has worsened significantly in recent weeks, highlighting just how fragile some markets remain. We continue to benefit from our diverse product portfolio including commercial credit scoring, fraud mitigation solutions, direct-to-consumer and government sponsored programs to assist lenders through the pandemic. In Latin America, revenue was up 5% on the strength of double-digit growth in our two largest markets, Colombia, and Brazil. Many of the smaller countries in Central America continue to see sharp declines as customers, consumers and governments navigate the challenges of the pandemic. In Asia Pacific, we grew 5% and continued recovery in our largest market, Hong Kong. There, we are seeing very positive momentum with our relaunched direct-to-consumer offering and are beginning to pursue more indirect partnerships. The Philippines remains very challenging and our current expectation is for a highly delayed recovery. Finally, Africa declined 5%. In our largest market, South Africa, the economy remains challenged and vaccination rollout has been slow. Based on recent market wins though, we do expect continue improvement in revenue as the year progresses. One of the many strengths of TransUnion is our balance sheet and our ability to rapidly generate cash. This provides us with consistent optionality to make the best decisions for the company and our shareholders. We finished the quarter with $433 million of cash on the balance sheet after voluntarily prepaying $85 million of our term loans. At the same time, our net leverage ratio continues to decline from 2.8 times at the end of the fourth quarter to 2.7 times at the end of March. With our strong balance sheet, we remained in a good position to continue to proactively pursue additional attractive investments, which remain an important part of our long-term growth strategy. That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. Starting with second quarter revenue, we expect slightly less than one point of M&A contribution from Signal and Tru Optik, as well as a two-point tailwind to revenue from FX. And we expect two points of benefit to adjusted EBITDA from FX. Revenue is expected to come in between $744 million and $754 million or a 17% to 19% increase, reflecting the improved macro-environment and very easy second quarter 2020 comparables. This results in organic constant currency revenue growth being up 15% to 16%. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximate two-point headwind from mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $296 million and $303 million an increase of 22% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $0.89 and $0.92, an increase of 35% to 39%. And for the full year, we expect 50 basis points of benefit from M&A and one-point of tailwind to revenue from FX. Revenue is expected to be between $2.949 billion to $2.992 billion, up 9% to 10%. Our guidance includes 1 to 1.5 points of headwind for mortgage reflecting the fact that we only expect mortgage to be a tailwind in the first quarter, and that it will be progressively more challenging in the remaining three quarters. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow revenue high single digits, financial services to be up high single digits and emerging verticals to be up low double digits. Excluding impacted mortgage, U.S. markets would be up low double digits and financial services would be up low double digits as well. We anticipate that international will grow mid-teens on an as reported basis as we continue to see a varied pace of recovery across our markets. And we expect consumer interactive to be of low single digits. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.157 billion and $1.189 billion up 11% to 14%. We expect one point benefit from FX. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand 80 to 130 basis points this year, even as we continue to aggressively invest in the business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year expected to be between $3.45 and $3.58, up 15% to 19%. At this time, we have no material updates to our other guidance items like tax rate, DNA, interest expense, and capital expenditures. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Yes, that's for sure. Chris said, I definitely would add to that, that we are in the FinTech players expand into new lending markets like credit card and especially the buy now pay later segment, which we've got a meaningful position and as well too. In addition, the story that we've told about how we won, share with FinTech with accelerated adoption and usage of our CreditVision suite of products continues to hold true as well with this customer group, as they enter into new markets. So we're very encouraged and excited about the potential with the Fintech's for the remainder of the year. Thanks, Chris. Hi, Andrew, just to finish off the question on the U.K., I mean that first of all kind of open up the quarter a little bit right, and show you what the trends look like by month, so a couple of things that are important. In January, we had a comparison to the prior year where we had a large onetime prior year deal in there. And then also you may recall that in January of 2020, that was the last month that we recorded revenue for business we divested by the name of Recipero. So if you exclude those two items, the U.K. actually would have been down mid-single digits in January. But typically, these are things we would never talk about, because we don't show the monthly trends and you would have just seen the quarterly number, but hopefully that that provides the context that you need. As it pertains to your second question about percentage breakouts of the end lending markets and financial services. What I can tell you is mortgage in particular on a trailing 12-month basis revenues were about 13% of total TransUnion mortgage. At this time, Andrew, we are not providing the details on auto, card and consumer lending. So probably that gives you enough - with mortgage. Toni, this is Todd sorry about the background noise there. As it pertains to the comparison to the prior year for our non-mortgage financial services business, I think what you know couple of things. First the financial services, the mortgage piece did, the growth did decelerate as - I've already said. We have seen a good recovery in many of our end markets like auto, which I talked about in my prepared remarks, that that was an area of particular strength for us. Card and banking and consumer lending, I would say I mean it's really the areas where, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, perhaps the growth rate isn't as strong. And a significant part of that is, you can't forget that Q1 of 2020 was a relatively strong quarter for us. We were not heavily impacted by the pandemic it was only about two weeks on it particular in the U.S. So if you think back to that period of time, the performance that we were seeing from our FinTech customers was exceptionally strong last year. So we're comping against that. And as I already said, our position with the FinTech's is an area that we're incredibly proud of. And we've got deep relationships with these customers. So again, as I answered in previous question, these guys are branching into, new businesses, and we're right there partnering with them. So they're a little bit slower to recover in the first quarter because of that comparison, but I think what's more instructive is what's ahead. And then that's really where we get into, just you know the opportunity of low double-digit growth in financial services, ex mortgage that space is a big part of that. Other thing to that I'd throw out there on FinTech side is, there's a lot of consumer lending that goes on in that space. Don't forget about two stimulus checks arrived for many consumers in the quarter, one early January and another one when quarter ended. So demand might not necessarily have been as strong as it has in the past. The other part that to I spent a lot talking about FinTech the other part though, is our bank and credit card business. Again, we were comparing against some really good growth in the prior year and the strength of credit card marketing activity that was pretty good in Q1 of 2020. And that business is now starting to recover as our customers are going to start fighting for wallet share with potential travel and dining out, picking up so we started to see that as well. So that's also just another part about the future that I think is important."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Let me add my welcome and my best wishes that you and your families are healthy. At TransUnion, our associates continue to largely work from home and continue to demonstrate their ability to support the needs of our customers and consumers. I remain grateful for their efforts and commitment. Now I'd like to lay out the agenda for this morning's call. First, I will discuss some of the broad macro and TransUnion specific trends that we experienced in the first quarter, and how they set the stage for a much stronger year than we previously anticipated. Next I will discuss our portfolio and strategies, which position us for high single-digit revenue growth at an attractive growing margin over the long-term. Finally, I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first quarter results in detail along with second quarter and full year 2021 guidance. Let me start with our strong performance in the quarter. We significantly outperformed our guidance as we experienced a rapid recovery in many markets throughout February and March. Todd will discuss some of the specific revenue trends later as part of his remarks. But the takeaway is that we broadly saw trends improve across our business, consistent with the many improving macro indicators. Notably, according to a JPMorgan report, U.S. consumer spending accelerated during the first quarter, outpacing 2019 levels, and according to the labor department, unemployment fell to 6% a pandemic low. In March, small business owners felt the most optimistic since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Taking together these and many other salient points from the first quarter indicate the start of what we hope will be a long sustained economic recovery in the U.S. as Americans return to more normal work and social behavior. We've seen similar trends in our key international markets. In the U.K., consumer confidence reached its highest level in a year, while income is expected to grow along with consumer spending in the coming quarters. In Canada, unemployment reached its lowest levels since March 2020. And consumer confidence hit pandemic era highs and in India reported unemployment dropped below pre-pandemic level, while consumer confidence and spending continue to recover. Like these metrics, our business improved as uncertainties resolved themselves positively. Business prospects improved and health concerns moderated. In short, the consumer is strengthened and businesses have regained confidence. For our business that led to a resurgence in demand for lending and new customer acquisition, resulting in improved non-mortgage performance in our financial services vertical even as the rate of mortgage growth slowed. Similarly, results accelerated as demand strengthened across our emerging verticals highlighted by double-digit growth in public sector, tenant and employment screening and media. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we saw better than expected performance as our direct business remain strong and declines in indirect channels moderated. We saw similar results in our international markets, with trends improving quarter-over-quarter in all our regions except the U.K. I would note that we continue to see the fragility of reopenings around the world, as evidenced by recent targeted lockdowns in Canada, lockdowns in almost all major cities in India, including Mumbai, and in parts of Colombia and elsewhere. This illustrates that recovery from the pandemic will be volatile and nonlinear, which we've attempted to accommodate in our financial outlook. Nonetheless, given our strong first quarter, and the more positive macro environment, we have substantially raised our full year 2021 guidance. Todd will provide you with the details later. Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term growth algorithm of high single-digit revenue growth at expanding attractive margins with double-digit EPS growth. Now I want to spend a few minutes on TransUnion's differentiated market position and approach which fuels this long-term growth algorithm. I've discussed these points on past earnings calls, but want to review them again as we continue to progress in each area. First, we have a track record of delivering outsized growth across the markets we serve through innovation and disruption leading to share gains. For example, in the U.S., we've grown rapidly in financial services due to our first mover advantage in trended and alternative data, which provides better credit insights for lenders and our deep understanding of their needs. This innovation and customer intimacy has helped us to grow much faster than the market as a whole. We also have developed deep partnerships with leading FinTech lenders positioning ourselves uniquely to grow, as ecommerce continues to disrupt traditional delivery of financial services. We've attacked in the insurance market by expanding from a credit and scores only position in personal auto underwriting into a broader set of solutions, serving multiple insurance, sub-verticals and use cases. And we've applied this approach of increasing breadth and depth of solutions in the healthcare and public sector verticals, and across the spectrum of diversified markets, such as telecommunications, ecommerce and tenant and employment screening. Most recently, we established media vertical and have won meaningful new relationships with partners such as Comscore, MediaMath and Blockgraph, which is owned by Comcast, Charter, and ViacomCBS. An earlier this month, we signed an agreement with OpenAP, a consortium of Fox, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS. We also announced earlier this month that we will extend our presence in the fast growing online gaming and gambling markets in the U.S. building our success in the U.K. In both cases, we provide valuable digital identity and fraud solutions to site operators to ensure they comply with local regulation and froth the efforts of fraudsters. Importantly, we will not offer solutions designed to extend credit to gamblers. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we engage consumers directly and indirectly through channel partnerships across industries, with solutions for personal financial management, identity protection and targeted credit offers. We established this attractive combined approach more than a decade ago by partnering with market leaders and benefiting from their growth. Recently, we've moved our direct-to-consumer business under our U.S. markets leader, Steve Chaouki. These two businesses can now combine the best of their offerings and pursue opportunities primarily in the indirect channel, where we help our customers serve consumers with engagement solutions, such as the CreditView dashboard. By closely aligning U.S. markets and consumer interactive, we can better leverage our combined capabilities. I will continue to share our progress as we develop this new strategy in our new organization. In addition to our attractive market positions, we have a proven and scalable enterprise playbook. Based on a foundation of customer and consumer insights, we've developed a repeatable approach to plant engagement, product innovation, and adjacency expansion. This approach fuels our ability to grow in excess often by multiples of a given underlying vertical or geographic market. In our recently established global solutions and global operations organizations, we will enhance and accelerate the use of our playbook across TransUnion. As an example of how this approach has produced meaningful results, I'll highlight the development of our insurance vertical in the U.S., which has substantially outgrown its underlying market. Historically, we focused on providing credit solutions to personal auto underwriters. Over time, we expanded systematically across the insurance value chain. Today, our offerings include fraud mitigation, customer acquisition, data prefill, underwriting assessment, policy renewal, analytics, collections and claims investigation. We've built a broad and differentiated position that is fueled many years of strong organic growth in the vertical. At the same time, we've entered adjacent insurance verticals using these solutions. From personal auto, we expanded into commercial auto bringing powerful driver insights. We also launched a data driven life insurance underwriting score, which we later extended to group life customers. And we also provide impactful solutions to assess the risk of apartment and condo buildings for commercial habitational insurers. All together, these innovations have enabled us to generate superior growth in our insurance vertical. In international, we've consistently utilized our growth playbook to outperform underlying markets regardless of their inherent growth rate. I want to use two examples of dramatically different markets India and Canada to illustrate the point. In India, we delivered a 32% revenue CAGR from 2016 to 2019. Now clearly, the underlying market grew rapidly during that time, perhaps low double-digits, suggesting that we outperformed by a factor of two to three times. We did that through thought leadership and by becoming a valued partner to the commercial banks, FinTech and government agencies that support lenders and consumers alike. We delivered a steady stream of innovation including CreditVision, CreditView, a powerful commercial credit score to validate in many other solutions. And we moved into adjacent markets including commercial credit, direct-to-consumer and insurance. In Canada, where we grew at a 12% CAGR from '16 through '19, our approach was much the same, but in a much more mature market. The underlying market likely grew in the low single digits and we outperformed by multiples. We did this again through thought leadership and close partnership with our customers. Our growth benefited from numerous centrally developed solutions that we leveraged in Canada, including CreditVision, CreditView, fraud mitigation, and Prama. We also extended into adjacent markets including insurance, public sector, and direct-to-consumer. The story repeats itself across verticals in geographic markets around the world. This approach allowed us to successfully enter new markets like the U.K., Colombia, in the Philippines, where our growth playbook enabled us to quickly deliver above market growth. We complement the growth playbook with powerful proprietary and third party data assets. In addition to our traditional attractive positions in consumer credit data, we've developed an array of alternative data assets to serve core and high growth used cases. I'll provide you with some significant examples, but not a comprehensive list. For lenders, we have trended credit payday and online short-term loans data, consumer contributed data through our MX partnership, and income and employment verification from the largest U.S. payroll processor. For fraud mitigation, we have a massive repository of device based fraudulent behavior that spans more than 15 years, and 8 billion devices from virtually every country in the world. We have access to public records from 1000s of sources delivered through TLOxp that powers investigative solutions used in virtually every one of our verticals. From our recent acquisition of Tru Optik, we have data on streaming devices and activity for more than 80 million U.S. households. In our insurance vertical, we offer a comprehensive driving violation data and state issued motor vehicle reports. And in our international markets, we have a similarly broad array of information including commercial credit data, public record data, and other alternative data, as well as differentiated data used by insurers in a number of countries. While we internally develop much of our data and analytics capabilities over these last eight years, we've also executed 20 acquisitions and a host of strategic partnerships that have meaningfully augmented our data assets and created value for our shareholders. And we continue to aggressively pursue new differentiated data assets. We also differentiate ourselves by how we manage the data entrusted to us. To that end, last week, we announced a preferred equity investment in and strategic cooperation with Spring Labs a leading financial technology firm transforming the exchange of sensitive data. Their advanced cryptography allows strict control of information visibility and their permission block chain provides a timestamp, immutable record and audit trail. Together, we can increase access to Spring Labs' data exchange network and products, while enabling us to expand protection of sensitive consumer data initially for fraud and identity verification. Our industry leading technology remains a competitive advantage. I've regularly discussed our track record of delivering on large scale complex technology initiative, as well as project rise, our current program to make TransUnion's technology more scalable, secure, efficient, and effective. So I won't recount them here. Project rise keeps us on the cutting edge of cloud computing and information security, and remains on plans to deliver considerable operational and financial benefits. As we achieve key milestones in the program, we'll continue to provide you with updates. Now underpinning these market positions, our culture is rooted in customer focus and partnership. We've built a company that understands the needs of the customers it serves and can deliver best-in-class solutions to meet those needs. We also balanced the sense of humility with a deep inner drive to be successful and accountable, while also taking the collaborative approach both internally and externally. As a result, we have built a track record of winning in the marketplace and delivering superior results. And our success in growth has allowed us to hire extremely high caliber talent across the organization. At the same time, our culture has always embraced diversity, equity and inclusion. Over the past year that has taken increased importance as we've witnessed an unprecedented wave of social activism aimed at remediating the historical injustices inflicted on minority populations. I've spoken before about our task force for racial equity, which continues to make progress. Most recently, we hired an experienced executive to lead our supplier diversity efforts and join three nonprofit organizations, which serve as chambers of commerce for diverse end businesses. I'll highlight a few other items relevant to this work. First, you can read in our most recent proxy about our Board's decision to link a component of our executive team's compensation to diversity hirings and promotions. Second, I'd encourage you to read our recently published diversity report, which highlights the good work that we're doing to create a more inclusive and diverse employee base. I was pleased to see that over the past year, we increased our percentage of global female leaders from 27% to 30%, a solid improvement, although we still have a lot of work to do to achieve our goal of gender parity at all levels. Third, in our sustainability report, you'll see that we have embraced the FASB and [indiscernible] reporting frameworks, along with making significant progress on all three dimensions of ESG. And finally, I would like to say equivocally that TransUnion stands in opposition to the surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. These actions are deplorable and unacceptable in any form. Now this morning, I've laid out TransUnion's differentiated market and portfolio positioning that has enabled industry leading growth since our IPO. I fully expect the same differentiators in which we continue to invest aggressively to fuel strong performance over the years to come. Now with that, let me turn over baton to Todd to walk you through our financial results and our second quarter and full-year 2021 guidance, Todd. Thanks, Todd. And to conclude this morning, we took you through a strong first quarter and a much more bullish outlook for the full-year based on significantly stronger macro trends across most of our markets. And we've discussed the differentiated portfolio market positions that have propelled TransUnion to best-in-class growth since our IPO, and that we believe will allow us to remain on this path in the future. I'll end by reiterating my hope that all of you and your families remain safe and healthy. And with that, I'll turn the time back to Aaron. Yes, sure Manav. Todd and I'll tag team on this one. But first, I would say that the consumer lending sub vertical was in financial services was one of the components of our business that strengthened month over month during the quarter, and that we expect will continue to benefit from the recovery. And of course, the FinTech players are material components of consumer lending. And generally we see strengthening there, we see an increased interest in new customer acquisition, which is terrific. And again, the longer-term we feel like e-commerce is going to become increasingly important to the delivery of financial services and we're very grateful for the partnership we have with so many of the players in that space, but generally speaking, I'd say it's a strengthening component of the portfolio that should benefit us in the quarters ahead. And so, Todd, anything you want to add to that? Yes, and then I would just add, as we've talked about in other calls, the FinTech space has been more stable during this downturn than many expected. And we've seen funding begin to flow back in a substantial way to the space. So it's all very encouraging. Next question? Yes, I'll leave that second question Andrew to Todd. But I will say, obviously, the U.K. has been very hard hit by COVID and the lockdowns had a negative impact on our business. We also just have some revenue lumpiness in the quarter, because we had a very large piece of business, a non-recurring business last January. And so that exacerbated the decline. What I'll say about TrueVision is that there has been a lot of interest in the product since we introduced it. We generated some revenue last year on a whole variety of customer pilots. We've built a very nice pipeline and we're beginning to convert into recurring revenue some of the banks that are part of that pipeline. So I would say, TrueVision penetration in the U.K. is encouraging and it's very much following the path that we experienced in the U.S. Todd? Yes, good question. I mean, look Prama remains a vital part of our new product offerings, and I'd say technology integration with our clients if you will. And we continue to invest materially in the product not only because it represents a new revenue stream for us as we mature the feature functionality, and we increasingly license it across the markets that we serve. But I think Prama and tools such as Prama are going to become more a supporting way of engaging with the marketplace. They provide direct access to the range of information that TransUnion and other bureaus provide, a lot of analytic and modeling technology, the ability to upload and append other types of information or unique financial institution information with the other data the TransUnion provides, the ability to place orders and monitor the status of the orders. And so it's a new interface layer to the range of services that the industry provides that we'll be building out over time. And we think it's going to provide uplift on revenues, one through direct licensing, but also really through improved utilization, and increased stickiness with our customers. Hi, Gary, thanks for the question. Obviously an important one for us to go through this morning. So we are starting with our assumption around mortgage. First, in our February earnings call, we did call for a 10% year-over-year decline. And I think what we saw happen in the first quarter, his mortgage actually continued to perform relatively well, albeit though, we did start to see the year-over-year growth rates start to taper off throughout the quarter as the comparison obviously gets significantly more difficult, because if you think back to March of 2020, that's really when mortgage took off on significantly when interest rates plummeted. So that's definitely, a part of it is that the Q1 performance was definitely stronger in my opening remarks, hopefully, I provided the necessary context on what our business would have grown with and without on the mortgage contribution. So as we extrapolate mortgage out for the remainder of the year, I think we had a little bit more of a pessimistic thought about what was going to happen and I think what we're seeing is the market is relatively holding in particular with refinance, but also know we continue to see a good activity on the purchase side of things. So with that being said if you just dive a little bit more into mortgage, what we talked about for Q1, as we said that, we had a 3% benefit, in the quarter from mortgage. And the guide that we're providing for the second quarter calls for a 2% headwind. So now we're starting to run into the comparables. And for the full year, we're calling for a 1% to a 1.5% on headwind. So if you just do the math, and kind of come up with okay well, what's going to happen in the second half of the year, we were anticipating to be down about 3% in mortgage. So there is definitely a tapering forthcoming. I think what's more instructive though, about our outlook and the portfolio of businesses that TransUnion has is, everything else that we're anticipating to recover in the second quarter and into the second half. In particular, financial services if exclude mortgage completely, we're talking about expectations of low double-digit growth. So that comes across all the other verticals - and lending markets, like auto, consumer and consumer lending, and bank and card so obviously, strong recovery there. In our emerging verticals, similar story, we're expecting low double-digit growth throughout - as I highlighted in my prepared remarks. So think about when I talked about with public sector and insurance and media, all performing very well. Our healthcare vertical, a little bit slower to recover, but nevertheless, they are. So we're expecting that in the second half of the year. But if you look at the emerging verticals, and excluded healthcare at low double-digits, would be up mid double-digits, so a lot of strength, that we're anticipating in the emerging verticals. Our international business, expecting mid-teens growth on a reported basis now there is, you know again, in my prepared remarks I laid out the caveats. I mean, there's clearly some unfortunate news coming out of India, as cases surge, as well as I mean other geographies that changing and operates in like Brazil, and even Canada, for example. So the recovery there won't necessarily be linear. And then finally, I'd say that, the consumer interactive business we're expecting low single-digit growth from that business as well. So all in all across the portfolio I feel, I think Chris, and I both feel very confident about what's taking hold. Yes Todd look, that's great color. And I appreciate the breakdown. The one small thing I find out on mortgage is that, we're incredibly focused on this as well forecasts will no doubt vary great. But as the rates have increased, and that has impacted the business, mortgage lenders are still very busy. There's a tremendous amount of work in process. And there's also they've been operating on a generous spread. And as we talked about in prior calls, there's the opportunity to cut into that spread in order to stimulate further demand. Yes thank you for the, thanks for the question. Yes, as we talked about for quite some time now. We think that the media and digital marketplaces will benefit from the precise matching logic and high data quality that TransUnion can bring. We have claim of scenes for many years now fueled the matching append operations of different players in this ecosystem. There is a slightly different set of players. And so, we decided to formalize it and enter you know, initially well obviously, we bring a lot of quality data sets. And as I mentioned, our match logic is very powerful given the core credit markets that we serve and more recently, we did acquisitions to acquire underlying data management technologies that allow us to bring together the range of data that we have in our match logic in a very user friendly way, where digital marketers can generate audiences on the fly. Also, recent acquisitions have brought us data and insights, as to which households are subscribing to various streaming services, both audio and video streaming services, which is letting which will allow advertisers to tap a really rapidly growing marketplace that does not have the same level of insights or add precision that the rest of the marketplace has. So, we've just bought a couple of businesses and Tru Optik and Signal, and we're merging them into our existing operations. We find the management team. We're doing product integration, integration on a variety of levels. And we're building out, are selling our products support, our product integration, and our platform integration activities, quite materially, that's going to continue to be a focus. It's an area where, we expect to have higher than average earnings for the foreseeable future. And we think it's a large end market that it can mature into one of our larger emerging verticals over time. And certainly, we're open to M&A to add additional capabilities as we see fit. Yes, good color Todd and look, I would just boil it down to this Toni, the engine is firing on all cylinders in Q1 of 2020 with the exception of the last two months of March when the lockdowns occurred. And I mean look - the non-mortgage portion of financial services grew 14% in the first quarter of 2020. The fact that we're now posting growth over that high level of growth, and I would guess that was probably a high watermark for our business, is just really encouraging going forward. And I think you're going to see that growth rate and that spread accelerate against the easier comps that we say in certainly Q2, but also Q3 and Q4. Yes, I'm not sure about the dynamic specifically related to reopening. But look as we all know, the pandemic resulting in the lockdowns was an enormous ecommerce forcing mechanism. And ecommerce penetration worldwide grew by multiples, right. And that has caused I think a structural change in consumer behavior. And then all of - that's just an increase in anonymous digital transactions, which require increasingly sophisticated identity and authentication. That's where I think our portfolio is well positioned because of the historic strengths that we've got, because we know a lot about individual consumers and can vary them. And we have sophisticated fraud propensity models, but we've also infused this with just gobs of digital information from iovation that's collected from almost every country in the world. Yes, good question. And I agree that we are well positioned coming out of this pandemic, recovery and I mean it feels a bit premature, to sit back given what's going on in some of our international markets in particular India and Brazil. But things are substantially better in the U.S. The vaccines are highly available the vaccination rates are substantially improving and in stages and have turned back towards the normal and consumption and that's really fitting our business. As Todd mentioned, the benefits are in almost every vertical across our portfolio in the U.S. with the exceptions of mortgage, which is going to face headwinds for a couple of years because the air is going to get let out of that balloon if you will that was caused by the low interest rates. And also, it's going to take some more orders for our healthcare business to return and to grow - find everybody that, in the first quarter of 2020 the healthcare business grew organically 9%. And we'd really kind of return to the targets that we expected and in particular during this pandemic. But look, the portfolio is still not firing on all cylinders. But I do think it's positioned for meaningful recovery quarter-by-quarter, as we re-emerge from this. I think you're going to see and acceleration in financial services from the non-mortgage verticals. I think the emerging markets are in the U.S. are particularly - the emerging verticals that is, are particularly going to accelerate. In the direct-to-consumer business, as lenders become more focused on new customer acquisition, our indirect channel will again become a strength, a differentiator that's going to propel further growth. And again, I'll remind everyone that in the couple of - in the few years prior to this pandemic, our international portfolio was growing at 12% to 15% organically, right. And it was a real strength within our enterprise. We grew 3% in the first quarter. And while that is a substantial improvement, look there is a lot of just inherent organic growth across that portfolio given that we serve emerging markets, growing middle classes, and increasing financial penetration, it's just those markets are grappling with COVID right now. But again, as vaccines rollout, and as we approach herd immunity in different markets, it's going to have a significantly beneficial impact on our results. Hi, Shlomo. Thanks for the question. And yes, it's obviously a good one to ask, because so much of the focus is on economic recovery, which undoubtedly does benefit TransUnion. But I would say that, if you were to look back over the last year, and we were to look at our portfolios and say - our pipeline of sales deals in the March timeframe. It was for deals to help our customers continue to grow their business, because that was the mode that they were in at that period of time. And it was remarkable how quickly our sales force pivoted to what was a new expectation from our customers to help them manage their existing portfolio. So if you were to look at our pipeline in May of last year, it drastically changed. And the reason I tell you that is it's just the expertise that we have in our sales force and understanding the customer's needs. But more importantly, how we are able to pivot not just sales, but the team supporting sales all of our - all the products and our performing teams to start to deliver products that are relevant for the customer at that time and we did that last year. And we reacted and we continued to win a significant amount of business throughout the remainder of 2020. As you move into the first quarter of this year, it's again, kind of remarkable how that pipeline turns over again. And you've heard us in our commentary talk about our customers looking to acquire again and start to market. So that pipeline has again changed, and it's changing for a different market that we've adapted to. So when we look and we provide guidance for the full year, we're not only just taking into consideration the macro factors, but we're also taking a look at the deals that the team has won and that's factored in here. So Shlomo I can't give you the precise breakdowns, but I think what's important is pipeline is robust. Our sales force is executing and we're winning. And it's really again driven by the superior product innovation that TransUnion has that arguably makes our sales teams very effective in the marketplace."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning.  Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. So with that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our solid in-range fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. I'll also review the posing progress with our recent acquisitions to accelerate revenue growth, achieve targeted savings, and leverage their technologies across the enterprise. Finally, Todd will detail our fourth quarter results along with our first quarter and full year guidance. Beginning with Slide 4, inflation in our developed markets around the world remained elevated throughout the year and central banks raised interest rates to slow consumer demand and return to long-term inflation targets. Economic growth flowed as a result. However, thus far, developing economies have been less impacted by these factors.  Activity in our international emerging markets of India, Asia Pacific, South Africa and LatAm have remained strong. Over the course of 2022, in the U.S., the UK and Canada, higher inflation and interest rates have pressured consumers and sapped economic growth.  In each succeeding quarter in these markets, growth slowed and consumers became more cautious, given the impact of inflation on their spending power. In the U.S., consumers are still healthy overall due to high employment and low debt-to-income levels, compared to before the pandemic. However, consumer savings have declined, delinquencies have risen and spending has fallen, especially for lower income and subprime consumers. Many of our large lending customers have confirmed this perspective and while their financials are still strong and consumer demand for credit is healthy, they too are cautious that their markets might slow further and as a result, have tightened lending standards, reduced originations and increased loss reserves. Despite these headwinds, TransUnion grew revenue at high-single-digits organically in '22, excluding the impact of mortgage in the U.S. and improved its margins, because of revenue fall-through and prudent cost management while also maintaining our transformational investments.  Our forecast for '23 assumes a continuation of the challenging market conditions from the second half of 2022 and little recovery over the year, although our growth rates will improve in the latter half due to easier comparisons. Despite this more \u2013 these more difficult conditions, we expect to grow revenue in the low to mid-single-digits in organic constant currency terms and expand adjusted EBITDA margins. Our investments in recent years have diversified our business along geographic, vertical and product dimensions and this expansion is enabling our ongoing growth even as U.S. lending markets slow. Attractive growth continues across our international markets, U.S. emerging verticals and our three recent acquisitions, Neustar, Sontiq and Argus.  Our solutions enable growth and effectiveness in all market conditions, and we believe we'll be able to grow organically in '23 even should the U.S. economy dip into recession. Todd will walk you through the details later of our full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals. Now in the fourth quarter, our business delivered good results despite challenging macro conditions and softening lending volumes in some markets. Our financial services vertical grew in the U.S., excluding the impact of mortgage. Auto lending increased due to easing of supply chain constraints and credit cards continued the strong originations seen for over a year.  And although consumer lending did declined slightly, it faced very challenging comparisons over breakout growth from a year ago. U.S. emerging verticals resumed attractive growth after an unusually slow third quarter due to anomalous and non-recurring factors.  Tenant employment screening volumes improved after stalling last quarter, and media revenues resumed growth after implementing systems improvements. Also, insurance carriers increased marketing as they began to receive rate increase approvals from state commissioners. Our international division, again, grew by \u2013 grew revenue by double-digits organically in constant currency, led by 33% revenue growth in India, 26% growth in Asia Pacific, 16% growth in Africa and 12% growth in Latin America. Canada grew 8% and the UK was up 3%, excluding one-time business from the year-ago quarter.  And our international sales teams continue to attain record bookings through thematic selling, leveraging innovation and expanding into attractive adjacencies. Importantly, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by about 110 basis points organically, while maintaining our heightened investment levels in transformational programs. And the growth momentum from our acquisitions also increased in the fourth quarter, especially at Neustar, where we made meaningful progress integrating our acquisitions and further developing our global enablement platforms. I'll provide further details on this in a moment.  And finally, we successfully completed the divestment of several noncore assets acquired as part of the Argus transaction, further lowering the purchase multiple and enabling strong returns. Our progress in the fourth quarter across these many areas illustrates the overall strength of our execution last year. We delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 7%, excluding mortgage, highlighted by the strength of our international emerging markets and strong growth in financial services in key emerging verticals.  We also delivered attractive adjusted EBITDA margins due to revenue flow-through, effective cost management, which we began late in the second quarter when we recognized slowing conditions and acquisition profitability improvements from growth and cost synergies. As a result, our cash flow remains strong and we prepaid roughly $600 million in debt throughout the year. Now on to Slide 7, 2022 was a strong year for the growth and integration of our recent acquisitions. These businesses are delivering financially and strategically and their strong results, along with positive customer feedback, confirm the rationale for each deal and the benefits of combining them with TransUnion's capabilities.  Neustar led the way by posting 8% organic growth in the quarter, over difficult comparisons from the last year with 9% growth in marketing. For the full year, Neustar revenue grew 6% at the high end of our revised guide. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% in the quarter and 26.5% for the full year, a 150 basis points ahead of our guidance at the beginning of 2022. The strong fourth quarter for Neustar sets the stage for another significant step-up in performance in 2023, which I'll discuss in a moment. TransUnion and Neustar marketing solutions together produced roughly $300 million in revenue last year, growing double-digits organically despite softer advertising market conditions and a step back in e-commerce activity. Marketing interest remains strong in these targeting \u2013 or for these targeting ineffectiveness solutions, as shown by our strong bookings last year and the growing pipeline of opportunities. Significant wins in 2022 include an eight-figure multiyear agreement with a performance-based marketing firm to become the primary provider of credit and foreign marketing, a deal with the card division of a large consumer bank for multi-touch attribution to help them optimize their spend across all addressable channels in a partnership with a major online streaming platform to optimize the monetization of their inventory using Neustar and TransUnion solutions.  We also completed the onboarding of the Fortune 10 company we announced last year and are benefiting from the ramp in its revenues. The fourth quarter also concluded a strong year of product integration as we continue to combine our data, products and infrastructure to create market-leading capabilities. Key accomplishments include, integrating TransUnion's relevant data into Neustar's OneID platform to enhance identity resolution, including our header file, phone and e-mail addresses, device IDs and auditing its targeting data, among others.  Commencing the replacement of all identity graphs across our non-FCRA products with our new enterprise graphs on One ID and beginning the consolidation of multiple audience targeting products on our TruAudience platform. We also closed eight datacenters and completed the migration of OneID to the Google Cloud, saving almost $20 million a year in recurring costs. And finally, we've integrated our identity resolution services into Snowflake's Media Data Cloud to enable their customers to enrich their information using our services, which utilize privacy-protected resolution capabilities fueled by offline and online identity intelligence from within Snowflake's environment.  This partnership continues our success in penetrating cloud-based data management environments using our identity services through partnerships including Amazon, Google and many other clean room and customer data platform providers. Now on to communications, our innovative family of trusted call solutions, which includes branded call display and color name optimization continues to provide differentiated growth. During 2022, we strengthened our position through several new partnerships that now provide TransUnion with the largest footprint of wireless and wireline devices in the U.S. Since the inception four years ago, Trusted Call Solutions has grown to more than $50 million of revenue, and we estimate that we've tapped less than 5% of the U.S. market. This enormous potential, combined with our sales reach into large enterprises and our international footprint, positions us for significant growth.  Our salesforces are now fully integrated, aimed to cross-sell Trusted Call Solutions across our many verticals, which has led to wins in insurance, collections and financial services and a strong pipeline entering the year. Now given Neustar's revenue momentum, we have confidence in a high-single-digit organic revenue guide for 2023 based on strong prior year sales and the 80% plus recurring nature of Neustar's revenue. We also expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand from 26.5% to 32% end year, positioning us to reach roughly 40% margins by 2025 as we fully realize cost synergies of at least $80 million now, increased from our prior guidance of $70 million. Now Sontiq revenue again grew in high-single-digits in the fourth quarter and for the full year on the strength of new subscription sales of integrated offerings with TU's consumer direct business.  Now this combination led to an 8-figure competitive win that should fully monetize in 2023. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins in '22 were 32% or 38% excluding integration cost. We also have a growing pipeline of opportunities for identity collection services across our financial verticals, which should ensure that we reach our targets for Sontiq. And in the quarter, Argus' revenues declined 3% as we lapped strong comparisons for spend-informed analytics and portfolio management services, resulting from a surge in credit card marketing beginning in late 2021. Now for the full year of '22, Argus grew revenues in the low-single-digits and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, or 29% excluding integration costs. We also divested G2, LCI and Fintellix, non-core businesses bought last year as part of the Verisk Financial Services acquisition for $176 million in consideration. Divestitures of the non-core assets from this transaction, along with expected cost and revenue synergies should comfortably lower the EBITDA multiple of this deal to high-single-digits and we continue to see renewed interest in the market for innovations using Argus data and insights.  Revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TU's analytic platforms and infusing our market insights will be the key to increasing revenue growth in the future. On our March 2022 Investor Day, we introduced our global operating model in our four enablement platforms, technology, data analytics, solutions and operations and during the year, we made considerable progress developing each. Our technology evolution will increase our development capacity and our innovation speed. With Project Rise, we are migrating to a hybrid multi-cloud environment on a common set of enterprise software services and eliminating redundant applications. In 2022, we moved 30 applications to our secure cloud environment and eliminated eight datacenters. This year, we will scale our migrations and move over100 applications to our two clouds and shutter portions of our legacy infrastructure. By the project end, two-thirds of our applications will run in the public cloud. With the acquisition of Neustar and its OneID platform, we formed a data and analytics function to create a common foundation for our data management, governance, decisioning and analytics tools globally. This team set up a security, privacy, and compliance guardrails around the world for all data assets and has developed a central identity resolution capability.  The DNA team has also enhanced our innovation lab model development capability using the OneID platform and extended the service from the U.S. into the UK to help lenders of all types enhance underwriting and compliance. We held a record number of innovation labs in '22 and we expect to increase this number in '23 as we roll this capacity out globally. And in solutions, we are integrating Neustar's fraud capabilities into our next-generation modular and flexible platform. We also rolled out U.S. products, like shareable into international markets. In India, we've launched a new solution to support agricultural lending, which accounts for roughly 18% of lending in that market. TU's CIBIL released a credit and farm report in October, which digitizes a traditional lending process by combining credit data with satellite imagery, land records and crop intelligence.  This powerful tool enables better decisions on agricultural loans and faster disbursements of funds to farmers, supporting our goal of using information for good and also promoting financial inclusion. And finally, our operations team implemented a common sales, service and order management system globally based on standardized and automated processes. In 2023, we'll continue to refine the user experience, workflow automation and analytics and reporting in the system to drive efficiency.  We also more than doubled the employees in our global capability centers from about 1,800 to roughly 4,000 through acquisitions and also internal hiring, including opening a new center in Costa Rica. We set up our GCCs in multiple locations around the globe to prevent a single point of failure, to minimize country risk and to provide services around the clock.  These centers offer broad capabilities and access to immense pools of talent along with proximity to markets with a rapid growth potential. Now that wraps up my comments on our market conditions, fourth quarter performance, and the meaningful accomplishments in 2022. Now Todd will provide you with further details on our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year '23 outlook.  Over to Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 14% on a reported and 17% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 19 points to inorganic revenue and I'll remind you that both Neustar and Sontiq contributed to organic growth beginning in the month of December.  Organic constant currency revenue declined 2%. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2022.  For full year 2022, mortgage represented about 6.5% or about $240 million of our total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and 17% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down 10 basis points, compared to the year-ago quarter.  Excluding Neustar and Sontiq in October and November, and Argus from the full quarter, the organic constant currency margin would have been 36.8%, up about 110 basis points, compared to the year ago fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 4% with adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense and a higher-than-expected full year adjusted tax rate of 22.4%, compared to our 22% guide. Our full year adjusted tax rate came in almost 0.5 point higher than we anticipated, primarily due to the completion of our analysis of certain tax implications of our recent acquisitions and the final determination of the impact of a change in the U.S. tax law regarding the requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses.  The result was a slightly higher full year adjusted tax rate with a cumulative catch-up recorded in the fourth quarter. I'd point out that our multi-year proactive tax strategy has resulted in an attractive adjusted tax rate and we continue to look at future opportunities to further ensure our tax structure is operating efficiently. Now looking at our segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 23% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic revenue declined 4%, but was up 3%, excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 21% on an as-reported basis and declined 3% on an organic basis. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 50 basis points on an organic basis. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that we are now reporting Neustar's financial results to the appropriate verticals. To help you with your modeling, we provided a recast of our 2022 results yesterday in an 8-K filing. The majority of the revenue remained within emerging verticals.  For the full year 2022, Neustar contributed $120 million of revenue, that is now part of financial services. All the results we provide today will be on the recast basis. Financial services revenue grew 6% as reported and was down 10% organically, excluding Argus for the full quarter and Neustar from October and November. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 2%, despite comparing to a 27% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2021, implying a 15% two year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end-markets, consumer lending remained in relatively good shape. Lenders continue to market and originate, even as we saw some modest targeted pullback. In the quarter, revenue declined 4% against 40% growth in the year-ago quarter. Our customers continue to confirm that investors are in market, but focused increasingly on lower-risk consumers and the lenders with the best recent track records. We've also seen balance sheet lenders using this as an opportunity to gain share. As we've done in past soft markets, we will use this as an opportunity to enhance our already strong position with fintech lenders, leveraging our expanded impactful set of solutions to help them understand their customers and make effective decisions through the cycle. Understanding that fintech is of particular interest to investors, let me put our current strong position in historical context. In 2022, total fintech revenue was about $175 million, up 15% over 2021, which had been the largest year ever. The prior largest year was just over $100 million of revenue in 2019.  That means today, we have a business that is almost 75% larger than just three years ago, driven not just by growing volumes, but also by share gains and innovation-led growth. We continue to believe that over the long term, we can continue this very strong growth trajectory as we win new business and expand our share of wallet with existing accounts on the strength of our innovation and the capabilities acquired with Neustar and Argus. Our credit card business had another solid quarter, growing 5% after nearly 30% growth in the year-ago quarter. We have seen consistently strong origination activity for more than a year. To-date, we've observed very limited pullback in customer marketing activity as most lenders are still in strong positions to find opportunities across its spectrum and gain top-of-wallet position with a generally healthy consumer Chris described. Our auto business delivered 14% growth in the quarter. We saw new vehicle sales tick up for the first time this year, days inventory on the dealer lot building and used vehicle prices coming down. These factors set the stage for an industry expectation of a 7% increase in new car production in 2023. We are already experiencing solid market trends in the early weeks of the first quarter.  Used car sales remained somewhat sluggish as higher interest rates tend to have a more pronounced impact in this part of the market. We continue to outperform the underlying market based on wins from the strength of CreditVision Link, which lenders are using to better assess risk in the current environment, ongoing success with our digital prequalification solutions and renewals with key Neustar auto customers. For mortgage, revenue was down 44% in the quarter and down more than 30% for the full year. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market has maintained modest origination levels. And as we've expected, HELOC activity has picked up as consumers use this as an efficient way to realize short-term liquidity. For 2023, we expect the inquiry market to be down mid-20s and our revenue to increase mid-single-digits. We expect to outperform the market on the strength of HELOC activity, increased demand from the targeted marketing solutions lenders are turning to in a very tight market and price increases. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 47% on a reported basis and 4% organically, excluding the revenue associated with Neustar in October and November. Insurance delivered another good quarter, growing despite the slowdown in marketing activity driven by higher repair and replacement cost and the extended time required for carriers to effect rate increases at the state level.  Our attractive portfolio of innovative solutions in commercial and life applications as well as drive a risk in our traditional private auto market have helped offset some of the macro issues in the market. Importantly, we've seen a steady stream of rate approvals on a state-by-state basis that should result in increased marketing activity and consumer shopping, both of which lead to revenue opportunities for TransUnion. Tenant and employment screening growth improved sequentially as a result of early signs of a recovery in the tenant market with month-over-month declines in rental rates and increases in move rates. This growth was somewhat offset by a softer employment screening market as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring. Our media vertical grew again in the quarter despite some modest market softness driven by multiple years of new business wins and accelerating usage levels with existing accounts. We continue to sign new deals and expect further growth in this area from the integrated go-to-market and solution offerings as discussed. Consumer Interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, declined 2% on a reported basis and declined 13% organically. As we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2021, our business benefited from significant breach remediation work last year. Excluding that large one-time business, organic revenue would have declined 5%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3% and down 5% organically. Similar to the previous two quarters, several factors adversely impacted revenue, moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, challenging multi-year comparisons to exceptionally strong performances in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021 and the comparison to one-time breach-related business.  Our continued strength in identity protection, an area where our Sontiq acquisition enhances our capabilities, partially offsets these factors. To update you on the direct-indirect revenue split with the inclusion of Sontiq, about two-thirds of revenue is indirect and one-third is direct. For my comments international all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 15% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue declined 5%. Excluding the revenue related to onetime contracts and including with the UK government, we would have grown about 3% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. We saw softness with many lenders in the fourth quarter, but have experienced improved trends in January.  At the same time, we had a strong quarter in our game vertical driven by heightened activity levels around the World Cup. Our insurance vertical also delivered good growth as more customers are using TruVision trended credit data for pricing and our consumer business has gained share due to the CreditView platform strength, and we won a large breach contract in large part because of Sontiq and its unique remediation capabilities. Finally, a few weeks ago, we announced an investment in Bud Financial, one of the leading open banking providers in the UK to help drive innovation and growth in the market and support financial inclusion.  Our Canadian business grew 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. Similar to last quarter, the macroeconomic indicators remain soft, yet our business continued to grow as we won material new business ranging from large banks to fintech entrants. These new wins are still ramping up, and we expect to realize the full financial benefits in late 2023. In India, we grew 33%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets, as well as from fraud, employment screening and direct-to-consumer offerings. In Latin America, revenue was up 12% with broad-based growth across our markets including another quarter of growth over 20% for our largest market, Colombia. While macro conditions have generally softened in the region, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintechs and neobanks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of CreditVision and our fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 26% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by new business with fintech players and exceptional growth in the Philippines, which is now running well ahead of pre-COVID levels as the economy is now fully reemerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory. And finally, Africa increased 16% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region despite a challenging environment that includes rolling electrical blackouts and other persistent challenges.  In South Africa, our core business continues to grow on the strength of new business wins and meaningful contract renewals. We also benefited from growth in fast-growing verticals, like telco and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong growth in markets, like Kenya and Zambia, particularly with micro and fintech lenders. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.7 billion of debt after prepaying $200 million in the fourth quarter and another $400 million earlier in 2022 that left us with $585 million of cash on the balance sheet, including the receipt of approximately $104 million of the proceeds from the noncore asset divestiture that Chris already covered.  We finished the year with a leverage ratio of 3.8x. Since our IPO in the summer of 2015, we have targeted a leverage ratio of less than 3.5x. Going forward, we intend to work toward a leverage ratio of less than 3x though as in the past, from time to time our leverage ratio may be higher than our target. With that said, from this chart, you can see that we have to rapidly reduce leverage as a result of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth. What's more, we intend to further prepay debt in 2023 with our excess cash flow. And at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not currently in our plans.  We are focused on absorbing, integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. We have multiple pieces related to our debt as we enter 2023 that impact our net interest expense. I want to spend a minute on these items.  First, our debt stack is unchanged entering 2023, but I wanted to lay out the three tranches with their associated rates on this slide. Second, we use a layering of swap instruments to hedge about 70% of our debt, which allows us the flexibility to execute, meaning prepayments.  At the end of 2022, a swap with $1.4 billion notional value and a rate of 2.7% expired, we replaced that with another with $1.3 billion notional value bought at a higher rate of 4.4%. You'll note this swap is a relatively short duration, expiring in just two years when we can optimistically contemplate a lower interest rate environment. Third, you can see the impact of higher LIBOR on our unhedged debt and the new higher rate swap on the right-hand side of the slide. The forecast uses the current forward curve. Net interest expense is expected to increase by $55 million.  However, and this is a critical point, this does not include any additional prepayment. This is in line with our longstanding practice of not providing speculative guidance about capital allocation, whether related to acquisitions, prepayments or any other activity.  However, for your consideration, as a rule of thumb, based on the current forward curve and on an annualized basis, every $100 million of debt prepayment would add about $0.03 per share to adjusted diluted EPS. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter where we have the most challenging comparisons of the year. For that reason, we expect our growth rates to improve as the year progresses. In the first quarter, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and two points of headwind from FX on adjusted EBITDA.  For revenue, we anticipate about a two point benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $908 million and $917 million or down 1% to flat on an as-reported basis and down 1% to 2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes an approximately two point headwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $316 million, a decrease of 6% to 7%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 190 to 210 basis points as a result of incorporating Argus' relatively lower margins and the impact of revenue mix.  We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.73 and $0.75, a range of down 19% to 21%, a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense. Turning to the full year, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and 1 point of headwind from FX on adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate approximately one point of benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as-reported basis and an organic constant currency basis and is the same excluding mortgage as we expect a minimal full year impact. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single-digits with and without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate financial services with and without mortgage to be up low-single-digits. We expect Emerging Verticals to be up mid-single-digits. We anticipate that international will grow high-single-digits in constant currency terms, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low-single-digits on an organic basis. Turning back to the total company outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion, up 3% to 6%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings, partially offset by the inclusion of Argus' relatively lower margins earlier in the year and some revenue mix considerations. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS declining 1% to 5% with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth. And to help you complete your modeling of 2023 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million.  We anticipate net interest expense will be about $280 million for the full year, up significantly, as I showed you earlier, due to rising rates. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. Our guidance assumes that current market conditions persist and does not incorporate a U.S. recession. Nonetheless, in the event that does happen, as we discussed in detail on our second quarter earnings call, we would still expect organic constant currency revenue growth albeit less than the mid-single-digit guide I just provided.  This growth is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership and innovation. And in this situation, I would expect incremental pressure on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating our recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations and we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns to the trajectory of revenue growth in order to support our attractive margin structure. I want to wrap up with some extra detail about our expectations for margin expansion in 2023. The bridge on this slide shows the significant benefit we expect to derive from the Neustar cost saving program. We also have good margin flow through from our revenue growth. Partially offsetting these positives are three factors.  First, we have the impact of Argus' lower margin for the first three months of the year as the acquisition closed in April of 2022. Second, we have the year-over-year impact of resetting variable compensation cost to target while also allowing for appropriate increases in employee compensation. And finally, we will have higher royalty costs in U.S. markets. At the same time, we continue to prioritize long-term growth-focused investments in all the areas that Chris discussed this morning. I am pleased to say that we expect to be able to expand the 2023 margin without taking any significant cost actions, largely because we have a long history of prudent, consistent cost management.  For example, in recent years, we've closed dozens of owned or acquired data centers, we've slowed hiring at times to calibrate to our growth and we have excellent expense management processes. Beyond that, we continue to reduce our cost structure and drive savings from the good work of our global operations organization, particularly through our global capability centers that Chris highlighted earlier and there is significant future cost benefits from these initiatives.  With that said, if the situation deteriorates, we have additional actions, like reprioritizing certain investments, managing T&E or other one-time costs that we can execute. We remain focused on maintaining our high quality workforce in order to fully execute all of the exciting projects that we've described in today's call. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thanks, Todd. I want to wrap up today's call by reiterating our commitment to our 2025 targets. Despite the market challenges we're experiencing, we expect to deliver against these targets, although we don't expect that the growth will be linear. Our combination of attractive end-markets and geographic footprint, along with differentiated and complementary solutions and a robust innovation pipeline gives us a line of sight to reaching these goals. Now let me turn it back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks today. For the Q&A, as always, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. Operator, we can begin the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jeff Meuler of Baird. Please go ahead. \nJeffrey Meuler: Yeah, thank you. So the overall revenue guidance looks quite good to me. You gave us a lot of detail on international bookings and emerging markets, conditions, trends in U.S. Emerging Verticals, Neustar, et cetera. It looks \u2013 I guess, the area that I'm struggling a bit with is, it looks like it implies quite an acceleration in U.S. financial markets getting really good growth, probably later in the year.  As you mentioned, consumer lending still worsening. You gave us mortgage. Just \u2013 it sounds like auto is kind of a mixed bag. Can you help us with that piece, just anything further you can say to give investors confidence in the implied better trends in U.S. financial markets later in the year?\nTodd Cello: Hey, Jeff, good morning. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. I think it's a very appropriate place to start this morning. So, clearly, when you look at our guide compared to the high end that we provided of about $3.885 billion, and you see whereQ1 where we're guiding $917 million at the high end, we definitely see a little bit of an uptick in the revenues from the Q1 levels. And largely, what we're seeing is we feel that we have felt the impact of businesses that are impacted by cyclicality. So, for example, the mortgage business, we definitely expect Q1 of '23 to be a further headwind. But as the year progresses, that those headwinds will start to find an equilibrium point, as well as we were able to take some pricing actions within mortgage that as the year goes on, we'll be able to moderate some of the volume decline. Another area to highlight would be our insurance vertical. We saw some unusual factors in the second half of 2022 with the high repair and replacement costs that our customers were seeing due to supply chain issues and they are in a way to increase their premiums. As you heard in my prepared remarks already this morning, we've started to see that subside. So we're expecting the insurance business to benefit from insurers being back in market \u2013 marketing, as well as consumers shopping for insurance. And just as a reminder, in our insurance vertical, it's not necessarily linked to car sales. It's more about the premiums and the impact to the consumer. So that shopping activity, we anticipate to be a driver as consumers are focused on managing their finances in this high inflationary environment. And to highlight that, too, the reason I just spent as much time as I did on insurance is, it's a large vertical for us now too based on the recast of the Neustar financials that increases the overall size of that business. And just a couple of other areas to highlight, our tenant screening business was another one that we saw some impact in the second half of 2022 as well that we're starting to see those trends subside as consumers are moving, more apartments are coming online, creating more capacity and as a result of that, rents are coming down. And then finally, I think the last one I'd highlight for you, Jeff, would be auto. Our auto business had a good fourth quarter, but what we're hearing from many of the auto manufacturers is the supply chain issues are starting to subside and we're expecting for good growth to come from a new car sales perspective. And similar to how I talked about insurance, the auto business will also benefit, as well from that shopping activity as consumers are looking safe hands. The last point I would make on this is that the guidance that we are assuming does have a sense of returning back to what I would consider to be normal seasonality for our business. So where Q1 looks a little bit light normally, you'd see Q2 and Q3 step up and Q4 maybe be a little bit less. So that's also been factored into our guidance, as well.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah, look, let me just \u2013 this is Chris, and just the first question, let me just set level set here. The basis of our forecast in '23 is heavily influenced by the challenging market conditions we saw in the fourth quarter, right? And so, while we're not assuming a recession, we are also not assuming any particular recovery. Now of course, the growth rates are going to increase in the back half of the year, because the comparisons are going to ease substantially. And then as Todd said, the first quarter of the year, because of seasonality is typically our softest from a revenue standpoint and it just so happens that this year, we're comparing against a very strong first quarter in 2022 where the enterprise grew 8%, financial services U.S. grew, I don't know, I think it was in the mid-teens, right? So things were quite robust then. But, over the course of '22, with each passing quarter, we saw softening in our U.S. financial services business and also in the FS businesses in other developed markets. So, we took that endpoint, which we think is near a bottom and we extrapolated from that. Now we've also got some countercyclical benefits. As you saw, our acquisitions are delivering good growth and Neustar, which is a very material chunk of the revenue we're guiding it to 8%. We exited the year at 8%.We've got a strong line of sight to that revenue, in particular, because as we've said before, it's about 80%recurring and we had one of our best selling years ever last year, good sales volumes and momentum increasing with each passing quarter, right?  So we feel like we've got a nice momentum in Neustar, which is a big kind of diversifying and countercyclical force at this point.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, Todd. I wanted to look at Slide 19. Slide 19, this is the margin slide, and particularly focus on the second red bar, the 45 basis point drag to formulate the '23 margin. I was hoping you could break down and maybe explain a little bit more the three items that are highlighted there, incentive comp, royalties and continued investments, recognizing that these three items are offsetting the revenue flow through.\nTodd Cello: Yes, good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So specifically, to the margin and you see almost a 50 point decline there. A couple of factors go into that. First of all, from a compensation perspective, since the second half of last year, TransUnion has been very focused on ensuring that we are making our hiring decisions on important strategic priorities for us. So we continue to fill roles that have that importance for us.  But when \u2013 and when we look forward, we're very proud of the talented team that we have and all the work that they accomplished in 2022 with acquisitions and organic initiatives, we felt that it was important to make certain that we're fully recognizing the extraordinary work of our people by providing the compensation necessary to increase for our merit and promotion pool as well. In addition, we also needed to reset our variable compensation up to target levels when you compare to what the payouts were in 2022. . A second thing to cover here would just be when you think about our volumes in areas where we are experiencing year-over-year declines in volumes, it's important to note that those declining volumes have a higher margin impact than any type of pass-through pricing markup that we would have on a higher royalty expense as an example. So that's the second important factor to go into there and I think third, and really getting back to the point just on our people, we are continuing to invest in several organic initiatives.  We're not sacrificing the long-term growth potential of TransUnion. So we continue to have meaningful investments in initiatives. Chris just covered several of them when he went through the global enablement platforms, and I think those areas really underscore the investments that we make to make certain that TransUnion is a growing and resilient company in the future.\nOperator: The next question is from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to pick up on the Neustar commentary. Chris, I think I heard you say that your Neustar revenues are derisked as we think about 2023. Maybe give us a little bit more perspective around that.  And how do you additional sort of big wins as we look at 2023? And perhaps you can give us some commentary around your perspective on market share in that business. Are some of these new wins related to market share? Or is it more \u2013 just more demand for some of the analytics that you're able now provide? Thanks.\nChristopher Cartwright: Well, just a quick comment on market share, I think it's difficult for us to comment on our relative market share with regard to Neustar marketing services at this point generally, there are more competitors, it's more fragmented. However, in my comments, I did highlight a series of very attractive wins that as we scored in this past year as well as pointing out that, that Fortune top 10 customer has been onboarding or did and the revenues are ramping. And so, look, I think those are good examples of competitive success in the market, and I would expect those to keep coming. Look, thinking about Neustar in a bit more detail. '21 was a very growthful year for Neustar. They did 8% organic and change. We expected that level of growth going into '22. What we were surprised by is that the foundation of growth in '21 was on an elevated level of e-commerce activity during the pandemic that dipped and as a result, midyear, we lowered our guide.  We also had some of the normal, I'd say, integration growing pains in the early part of the year. But pretty quickly, all of that started to gel together and we began executing well on the sales side. And in each passing quarter, over the course of '22, we sold more, we sold more broadly and we built really nice momentum going into '23.  And look, the 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year for Neustar, it's important because that comes on top of 9% organic growth roughly the prior year, right? So it's growth over a meaningful comparison and then you get to '23. Now look, derisk in such a risky environment, is always a difficult term to address. And I'm only half kidding here. The fact is we got great momentum, we had a big year of sales, we've got probably higher line of sight to the 8% growth than we typically would coming into the New Year and I feel like we're just getting our rhythm, our mojo, if you will, in terms of cross-selling Neustar products across all of our verticals. So that's my two cents about the sales and revenue momentum at Neustar. I'd also point out that the product integration has gone really well. It's going very well in terms of getting TransUnion data into the OneID database that underpins all of Neustar's identity resolution for marketing and fraud, I think we got further faster than we expected. And now we're taking that really best-in-class identity and we're integrating it into all of our products across TransUnion in the U.S. on the non-FCRA side, right? Additionally, now, we've combined all of our audience capabilities, our data and our platforms, that's coming together. And we achieved a huge step in our integration, right? We closed eight Neustar data centers, and we migrated Neustar's core technology to a new cloud provider and we \u2013 or added $20 million in recurring EBITDA as a result.  So I feel like we're getting nice traction, but our plan is to continue our heads-down execution on this deal and to build further momentum over the course of the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous. Please go ahead. \nKelsey Zhu: Hey guys. On Consumer Interactive, margin fee this quarter is partially due to kind of reduced in investment in advertising. So I was just wondering, should we expect this going forward into '23? And if that's the case, how do you think about the shift in competitive length in that market as some of your competitors is still continue to invest in these products?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, absolutely. Well, look, our consumer direct businesses have faced a series of challenges in the near term. On the indirect side, we needed to lap some contract restructuring and that's the single largest piece and on the direct-to-consumer side also, we realized that some of our marketing wasn't yielding fully profitable new customers.  And also, we wanted to adjust our acquisition workflows to ensure that they were as consumer-friendly as they could possibly be. As a result, we curtailed some of our direct advertising. And as a consequence of that, we're winning new \u2013 smaller new classes of customers, if you will, to replace those at attrit over the course of the year. As we look to '23 though, the foundation is firming considerably and the rate of decline is moderating, in particular, it moderates quarter-by-quarter over the course of the year. So first, there's Sontiq. Sontiq, we believe, is a long-term mid-teens grower.  Now last year, we didn't have the benefit of a particularly large breach. But we did accelerate our subscription sales with Sontiq, which is especially valuable because of the high recurring nature. In '23, Sontiq grows in the mid-teens. On the indirect side, in '23, we expect to return to mid-single digits growth. And then in the direct subscriptions to consumers, the first half of the year, we're still declining because of the change in marketing spend and practices. But by the second half of the year, in the fourth quarter, in particular, we think we get that behind us. So net-net, those are kind of the dynamics that we see in direct-to-consumer. Todd, any particular comments on the margin profile go forward?\nTodd Cello: Yes. So the first thing I would add on the margin is the Consumer Interactive business always has had an attractive margin profile with adjusted EBITDA margin in the upper 40% range, sometimes to 50%. And clearly, that's what we just saw in the fourth quarter.  So as we look forward into 2023, and Chris just spoke about the direct business, and that's really where the opportunity resides for us to gain efficiencies and optimize our advertising spend, the team has done a great job with that. So as a result, we would expect that the margin for this business would be in the same range that we've had historically. So in that high 40s to around 50% adjusted EBITDA margin.\nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nToni Kaplan: Thank you very much. I noticed that you reiterated the 2025 targets. And for adjusted EPS at $6 versus the midpoint of the '23guidance, that would imply like a 30% CAGR from '23 to '25. So, maybe just talk about your confidence in achieving it. Like, I guess, clearly, you do believe it because you wouldn't have reiterated it, but I mean, I just think it sounds sort of high, but I know you can \u2013 I know you clearly have reasons as to why you think you can achieve it. Thanks.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, thanks for the question, Toni. Well, look, I mean, right now, we're facing some challenging market conditions in lending verticals in developed markets, and I think it's easy perhaps to get a bit more pessimistic about those things. But we're talking about \u2013 we've got three full years to get there. We have a variety of paths to get there.  We expect that over this period that market conditions generally are going to improve materially. And what we've seen is that our business has the potential to grow very rapidly coming out of downturns. We did so in the 2010 time frame. We did so again coming out of the pandemic where we posted 13% enterprise growth and again, there are a whole variety of different ways to get there. I would point out that our results in this particular quarter generally are tempered a bit by volumes in fintech.That said, the reason we went into the detail on that space and our commentary is we wanted to \u2013 we wanted the market to understand just how growthful that business has been. It's been a nice cherry on top of our overall lending portfolio.  And we think that the growth coming from disruption in that space is going to continue. There's just been a bit of a pause, some caution, as players try to understand market conditions and funding sources and the like. So I think we're going to get disproportionate growth out of fintech, out of Neustar, out of the resurgence in Emerging Verticals and then India. India is becoming really material for us. It grew by 1/3 last year. And while we don't have that rate of growth in our plan, we've got a heck of a lot of upside and we've got a lot of ambitions to expand the number of markets that we play in, in India. So I mean, look, perhaps we revisit this at the end of the year. But at this point, I think, again, we can get there. There are a multitude of different paths. And then I think you were more focused on EPS, and I'm going to let Todd take that one.\nTodd Cello: So from an EPS point of view, I mean, one of the significant drags that we've had is the rise in the \u2013 in LIBOR, which our debt is still tied to for the time being. So that has a rather significant impact on the EPS. In 2023, we had an impact of about $0.22. So think of it another way. Our \u2013 the guide on EPS would be up another 22% if interest rates were, like roughly flat $0.22. So, if you now think about that over the next three years, if you believe that interest rates decline, TransUnion and the rest of the market, we get a natural benefit there. So not an operating factor, but it wasn't an operating factor that provided this headwind, as well.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes and again, just to reiterate, we're very focused on driving as much growth as we can out of the new acquisitions and taking costs out. We\u2019re happy to be able to raise the guide to $80 million in synergies from Neustar. And look, I hope a year from now, I can come back and share even better news on that front, but we're also focused on paying down our debt. We're hoping to get to 3.5x this year and to take it as low as 3x or below by the end of the following year. That's a lot of interest savings that will benefit the EPS.\nTodd Cello: And just to underscore that point, as we always do with our guidance, we do not make assumptions on capital allocation decisions with cash that builds. So to that point, if you look at our guide for '23 and then even out into the future, those paydowns are not incorporated into the overall adjusted diluted EPS, as well.\nOperator: The next question is from Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Please go ahead. \nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. You had a lot of helpful commentary on how you would perform if there was a recession and I was just wondering, do you guys have any internal macro calls and probably the probability of that given all the data that you see?  And just tied to that, the gaps overall, is this \u2013 would you characterize this as conservative as true has been historically or is it more, I think, last year, when we came out with guidance, you talked about it being less conservative, more realistic? So just trying to get a sense of what this year is set up to be.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, Manav, good question on guidance philosophy, but also just kind of some macro insights. So what I'll say is, look, I think you should take us at our word on the guidance for '23, right? We crafted a range after a significant amount of deliberation and thought that we think is reflective of what we can do. Now if economic conditions were to deviate materially in one direction or another, that's a different factor, right? But I mean, we're guiding 3% to 5%. I think you should consider 3% to 5%. And again, if you look at our fourth quarter, we outlined a guidance range, and we delivered within that guidance range for revenue, for EBITDA, and on an operating basis from EPS. The small miss on the EPS was due to a tax item, below-the-line item, right? So I think we would just ask investors to take us our word on the guide, that's where we're targeting. And in terms of the macro stuff, look, I can arm your quarter back with you, but the reality is all of you guys have much smarter and more qualified economists on your staff. So, I am going to pass on that question.\nOperator: The last question is from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you. I am going to piggyback off the last question. I won't ask you your macro forecast again, but just in terms of the guidance range and looking at the low end of the range, I'd be curious to kind of what assumptions are baked into that is how you're thinking about that range? And then, layer on there, you expressed confidence in your ability to grow in a recession, so how to think of end of the range and maybe how that compares to a potential recession scenario?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, probably the first comment to make on this question is about diversification across the portfolio and how that dynamic is playing out. Without a doubt, our lending lines of business has slowed materially in developed markets because of the effect of inflation, first, and then rising rates. And potentially, may have slowed a little extra because it just uncertainty, right?  When there is uncertainty in the market, transaction volumes fall, right? And as certainty gets restored around the direction of inflation, around the direction of rates, we could see some improvements. But the negative is around the lending volumes. The positive and again, in the U.S., I'll remind you that the emerging verticals are equal in size to the lending verticals, right?  And their growth is increasing. It increased from 1% in the third quarter, which we said was based on anomalous non-recurring factors, to 4%, and we expect it to improve again over the course of '23. The international businesses, there was less fiscal stimulus, so they are not dealing with the same degree of elevated inflation.  They continue to roll. That business is $800million. It's grown \u2013 we've targeted to grow in the low double-digits. There's a lot of momentum there, right? And it's broad-based momentum because our footprint is more skewed. So that's going to be growthful. And then direct-to-consumer because we've had a reset in process over the past 12 months, has been a material drag on our results, and we see that improving substantially over the fourth quarter. Now again, I just want to reiterate in terms of the guidance. We didn't model in a recession, and we didn't model in economic improvement. We took a very challenging macro environment in our fourth quarter and we largely model off of that.  Now again, there's any number of puts and takes given the multitude of verticals and sub-verticals. But we think it's a prudent guide, it's not overly negative, but it's also not founded on some back-end optimism. And again, the reason organic growth rates increased in the latter half of the year is because our comps are much, much easier, particularly in the fourth quarter.\nAaron Hoffman: Excellent. Chris, thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. There's a lot to digest I think in our call. We hope we take the time to do that and let us know we can be of assistance as you contemplate the print today. So we hope you have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our solid in-range fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA. I'll also review the posing progress with our recent acquisitions to accelerate revenue growth, achieve targeted savings, and leverage their technologies across the enterprise. Finally, Todd will detail our fourth quarter results along with our first quarter and full year guidance. Beginning with Slide 4, inflation in our developed markets around the world remained elevated throughout the year and central banks raised interest rates to slow consumer demand and return to long-term inflation targets. Economic growth flowed as a result. However, thus far, developing economies have been less impacted by these factors.  Activity in our international emerging markets of India, Asia Pacific, South Africa and LatAm have remained strong. Over the course of 2022, in the U.S., the UK and Canada, higher inflation and interest rates have pressured consumers and sapped economic growth.  In each succeeding quarter in these markets, growth slowed and consumers became more cautious, given the impact of inflation on their spending power. In the U.S., consumers are still healthy overall due to high employment and low debt-to-income levels, compared to before the pandemic. However, consumer savings have declined, delinquencies have risen and spending has fallen, especially for lower income and subprime consumers. Many of our large lending customers have confirmed this perspective and while their financials are still strong and consumer demand for credit is healthy, they too are cautious that their markets might slow further and as a result, have tightened lending standards, reduced originations and increased loss reserves. Despite these headwinds, TransUnion grew revenue at high-single-digits organically in '22, excluding the impact of mortgage in the U.S. and improved its margins, because of revenue fall-through and prudent cost management while also maintaining our transformational investments.  Our forecast for '23 assumes a continuation of the challenging market conditions from the second half of 2022 and little recovery over the year, although our growth rates will improve in the latter half due to easier comparisons. Despite this more \u2013 these more difficult conditions, we expect to grow revenue in the low to mid-single-digits in organic constant currency terms and expand adjusted EBITDA margins. Our investments in recent years have diversified our business along geographic, vertical and product dimensions and this expansion is enabling our ongoing growth even as U.S. lending markets slow. Attractive growth continues across our international markets, U.S. emerging verticals and our three recent acquisitions, Neustar, Sontiq and Argus.  Our solutions enable growth and effectiveness in all market conditions, and we believe we'll be able to grow organically in '23 even should the U.S. economy dip into recession. Todd will walk you through the details later of our full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals. Now in the fourth quarter, our business delivered good results despite challenging macro conditions and softening lending volumes in some markets. Our financial services vertical grew in the U.S., excluding the impact of mortgage. Auto lending increased due to easing of supply chain constraints and credit cards continued the strong originations seen for over a year.  And although consumer lending did declined slightly, it faced very challenging comparisons over breakout growth from a year ago. U.S. emerging verticals resumed attractive growth after an unusually slow third quarter due to anomalous and non-recurring factors.  Tenant employment screening volumes improved after stalling last quarter, and media revenues resumed growth after implementing systems improvements. Also, insurance carriers increased marketing as they began to receive rate increase approvals from state commissioners. Our international division, again, grew by \u2013 grew revenue by double-digits organically in constant currency, led by 33% revenue growth in India, 26% growth in Asia Pacific, 16% growth in Africa and 12% growth in Latin America. Canada grew 8% and the UK was up 3%, excluding one-time business from the year-ago quarter.  And our international sales teams continue to attain record bookings through thematic selling, leveraging innovation and expanding into attractive adjacencies. Importantly, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by about 110 basis points organically, while maintaining our heightened investment levels in transformational programs. And the growth momentum from our acquisitions also increased in the fourth quarter, especially at Neustar, where we made meaningful progress integrating our acquisitions and further developing our global enablement platforms. I'll provide further details on this in a moment.  And finally, we successfully completed the divestment of several noncore assets acquired as part of the Argus transaction, further lowering the purchase multiple and enabling strong returns. Our progress in the fourth quarter across these many areas illustrates the overall strength of our execution last year. We delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 7%, excluding mortgage, highlighted by the strength of our international emerging markets and strong growth in financial services in key emerging verticals.  We also delivered attractive adjusted EBITDA margins due to revenue flow-through, effective cost management, which we began late in the second quarter when we recognized slowing conditions and acquisition profitability improvements from growth and cost synergies. As a result, our cash flow remains strong and we prepaid roughly $600 million in debt throughout the year. Now on to Slide 7, 2022 was a strong year for the growth and integration of our recent acquisitions. These businesses are delivering financially and strategically and their strong results, along with positive customer feedback, confirm the rationale for each deal and the benefits of combining them with TransUnion's capabilities.  Neustar led the way by posting 8% organic growth in the quarter, over difficult comparisons from the last year with 9% growth in marketing. For the full year, Neustar revenue grew 6% at the high end of our revised guide. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% in the quarter and 26.5% for the full year, a 150 basis points ahead of our guidance at the beginning of 2022. The strong fourth quarter for Neustar sets the stage for another significant step-up in performance in 2023, which I'll discuss in a moment. TransUnion and Neustar marketing solutions together produced roughly $300 million in revenue last year, growing double-digits organically despite softer advertising market conditions and a step back in e-commerce activity. Marketing interest remains strong in these targeting \u2013 or for these targeting ineffectiveness solutions, as shown by our strong bookings last year and the growing pipeline of opportunities. Significant wins in 2022 include an eight-figure multiyear agreement with a performance-based marketing firm to become the primary provider of credit and foreign marketing, a deal with the card division of a large consumer bank for multi-touch attribution to help them optimize their spend across all addressable channels in a partnership with a major online streaming platform to optimize the monetization of their inventory using Neustar and TransUnion solutions.  We also completed the onboarding of the Fortune 10 company we announced last year and are benefiting from the ramp in its revenues. The fourth quarter also concluded a strong year of product integration as we continue to combine our data, products and infrastructure to create market-leading capabilities. Key accomplishments include, integrating TransUnion's relevant data into Neustar's OneID platform to enhance identity resolution, including our header file, phone and e-mail addresses, device IDs and auditing its targeting data, among others.  Commencing the replacement of all identity graphs across our non-FCRA products with our new enterprise graphs on One ID and beginning the consolidation of multiple audience targeting products on our TruAudience platform. We also closed eight datacenters and completed the migration of OneID to the Google Cloud, saving almost $20 million a year in recurring costs. And finally, we've integrated our identity resolution services into Snowflake's Media Data Cloud to enable their customers to enrich their information using our services, which utilize privacy-protected resolution capabilities fueled by offline and online identity intelligence from within Snowflake's environment.  This partnership continues our success in penetrating cloud-based data management environments using our identity services through partnerships including Amazon, Google and many other clean room and customer data platform providers. Now on to communications, our innovative family of trusted call solutions, which includes branded call display and color name optimization continues to provide differentiated growth. During 2022, we strengthened our position through several new partnerships that now provide TransUnion with the largest footprint of wireless and wireline devices in the U.S. Since the inception four years ago, Trusted Call Solutions has grown to more than $50 million of revenue, and we estimate that we've tapped less than 5% of the U.S. market. This enormous potential, combined with our sales reach into large enterprises and our international footprint, positions us for significant growth.  Our salesforces are now fully integrated, aimed to cross-sell Trusted Call Solutions across our many verticals, which has led to wins in insurance, collections and financial services and a strong pipeline entering the year. Now given Neustar's revenue momentum, we have confidence in a high-single-digit organic revenue guide for 2023 based on strong prior year sales and the 80% plus recurring nature of Neustar's revenue. We also expect adjusted EBITDA margin to expand from 26.5% to 32% end year, positioning us to reach roughly 40% margins by 2025 as we fully realize cost synergies of at least $80 million now, increased from our prior guidance of $70 million. Now Sontiq revenue again grew in high-single-digits in the fourth quarter and for the full year on the strength of new subscription sales of integrated offerings with TU's consumer direct business.  Now this combination led to an 8-figure competitive win that should fully monetize in 2023. Also, adjusted EBITDA margins in '22 were 32% or 38% excluding integration cost. We also have a growing pipeline of opportunities for identity collection services across our financial verticals, which should ensure that we reach our targets for Sontiq. And in the quarter, Argus' revenues declined 3% as we lapped strong comparisons for spend-informed analytics and portfolio management services, resulting from a surge in credit card marketing beginning in late 2021. Now for the full year of '22, Argus grew revenues in the low-single-digits and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, or 29% excluding integration costs. We also divested G2, LCI and Fintellix, non-core businesses bought last year as part of the Verisk Financial Services acquisition for $176 million in consideration. Divestitures of the non-core assets from this transaction, along with expected cost and revenue synergies should comfortably lower the EBITDA multiple of this deal to high-single-digits and we continue to see renewed interest in the market for innovations using Argus data and insights.  Revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TU's analytic platforms and infusing our market insights will be the key to increasing revenue growth in the future. On our March 2022 Investor Day, we introduced our global operating model in our four enablement platforms, technology, data analytics, solutions and operations and during the year, we made considerable progress developing each. Our technology evolution will increase our development capacity and our innovation speed. With Project Rise, we are migrating to a hybrid multi-cloud environment on a common set of enterprise software services and eliminating redundant applications. In 2022, we moved 30 applications to our secure cloud environment and eliminated eight datacenters. This year, we will scale our migrations and move over100 applications to our two clouds and shutter portions of our legacy infrastructure. By the project end, two-thirds of our applications will run in the public cloud. With the acquisition of Neustar and its OneID platform, we formed a data and analytics function to create a common foundation for our data management, governance, decisioning and analytics tools globally. This team set up a security, privacy, and compliance guardrails around the world for all data assets and has developed a central identity resolution capability.  The DNA team has also enhanced our innovation lab model development capability using the OneID platform and extended the service from the U.S. into the UK to help lenders of all types enhance underwriting and compliance. We held a record number of innovation labs in '22 and we expect to increase this number in '23 as we roll this capacity out globally. And in solutions, we are integrating Neustar's fraud capabilities into our next-generation modular and flexible platform. We also rolled out U.S. products, like shareable into international markets. In India, we've launched a new solution to support agricultural lending, which accounts for roughly 18% of lending in that market. TU's CIBIL released a credit and farm report in October, which digitizes a traditional lending process by combining credit data with satellite imagery, land records and crop intelligence.  This powerful tool enables better decisions on agricultural loans and faster disbursements of funds to farmers, supporting our goal of using information for good and also promoting financial inclusion. And finally, our operations team implemented a common sales, service and order management system globally based on standardized and automated processes. In 2023, we'll continue to refine the user experience, workflow automation and analytics and reporting in the system to drive efficiency.  We also more than doubled the employees in our global capability centers from about 1,800 to roughly 4,000 through acquisitions and also internal hiring, including opening a new center in Costa Rica. We set up our GCCs in multiple locations around the globe to prevent a single point of failure, to minimize country risk and to provide services around the clock.  These centers offer broad capabilities and access to immense pools of talent along with proximity to markets with a rapid growth potential. Now that wraps up my comments on our market conditions, fourth quarter performance, and the meaningful accomplishments in 2022. Now Todd will provide you with further details on our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year '23 outlook.  Over to Todd. Thanks, Todd. I want to wrap up today's call by reiterating our commitment to our 2025 targets. Despite the market challenges we're experiencing, we expect to deliver against these targets, although we don't expect that the growth will be linear. Our combination of attractive end-markets and geographic footprint, along with differentiated and complementary solutions and a robust innovation pipeline gives us a line of sight to reaching these goals. Now let me turn it back to Aaron. Yeah, look, let me just \u2013 this is Chris, and just the first question, let me just set level set here. The basis of our forecast in '23 is heavily influenced by the challenging market conditions we saw in the fourth quarter, right? And so, while we're not assuming a recession, we are also not assuming any particular recovery. Now of course, the growth rates are going to increase in the back half of the year, because the comparisons are going to ease substantially. And then as Todd said, the first quarter of the year, because of seasonality is typically our softest from a revenue standpoint and it just so happens that this year, we're comparing against a very strong first quarter in 2022 where the enterprise grew 8%, financial services U.S. grew, I don't know, I think it was in the mid-teens, right? So things were quite robust then. But, over the course of '22, with each passing quarter, we saw softening in our U.S. financial services business and also in the FS businesses in other developed markets. So, we took that endpoint, which we think is near a bottom and we extrapolated from that. Now we've also got some countercyclical benefits. As you saw, our acquisitions are delivering good growth and Neustar, which is a very material chunk of the revenue we're guiding it to 8%. We exited the year at 8%.We've got a strong line of sight to that revenue, in particular, because as we've said before, it's about 80%recurring and we had one of our best selling years ever last year, good sales volumes and momentum increasing with each passing quarter, right?  So we feel like we've got a nice momentum in Neustar, which is a big kind of diversifying and countercyclical force at this point. Well, just a quick comment on market share, I think it's difficult for us to comment on our relative market share with regard to Neustar marketing services at this point generally, there are more competitors, it's more fragmented. However, in my comments, I did highlight a series of very attractive wins that as we scored in this past year as well as pointing out that, that Fortune top 10 customer has been onboarding or did and the revenues are ramping. And so, look, I think those are good examples of competitive success in the market, and I would expect those to keep coming. Look, thinking about Neustar in a bit more detail. '21 was a very growthful year for Neustar. They did 8% organic and change. We expected that level of growth going into '22. What we were surprised by is that the foundation of growth in '21 was on an elevated level of e-commerce activity during the pandemic that dipped and as a result, midyear, we lowered our guide.  We also had some of the normal, I'd say, integration growing pains in the early part of the year. But pretty quickly, all of that started to gel together and we began executing well on the sales side. And in each passing quarter, over the course of '22, we sold more, we sold more broadly and we built really nice momentum going into '23.  And look, the 8% organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year for Neustar, it's important because that comes on top of 9% organic growth roughly the prior year, right? So it's growth over a meaningful comparison and then you get to '23. Now look, derisk in such a risky environment, is always a difficult term to address. And I'm only half kidding here. The fact is we got great momentum, we had a big year of sales, we've got probably higher line of sight to the 8% growth than we typically would coming into the New Year and I feel like we're just getting our rhythm, our mojo, if you will, in terms of cross-selling Neustar products across all of our verticals. So that's my two cents about the sales and revenue momentum at Neustar. I'd also point out that the product integration has gone really well. It's going very well in terms of getting TransUnion data into the OneID database that underpins all of Neustar's identity resolution for marketing and fraud, I think we got further faster than we expected. And now we're taking that really best-in-class identity and we're integrating it into all of our products across TransUnion in the U.S. on the non-FCRA side, right? Additionally, now, we've combined all of our audience capabilities, our data and our platforms, that's coming together. And we achieved a huge step in our integration, right? We closed eight Neustar data centers, and we migrated Neustar's core technology to a new cloud provider and we \u2013 or added $20 million in recurring EBITDA as a result.  So I feel like we're getting nice traction, but our plan is to continue our heads-down execution on this deal and to build further momentum over the course of the year. Yes, absolutely. Well, look, our consumer direct businesses have faced a series of challenges in the near term. On the indirect side, we needed to lap some contract restructuring and that's the single largest piece and on the direct-to-consumer side also, we realized that some of our marketing wasn't yielding fully profitable new customers.  And also, we wanted to adjust our acquisition workflows to ensure that they were as consumer-friendly as they could possibly be. As a result, we curtailed some of our direct advertising. And as a consequence of that, we're winning new \u2013 smaller new classes of customers, if you will, to replace those at attrit over the course of the year. As we look to '23 though, the foundation is firming considerably and the rate of decline is moderating, in particular, it moderates quarter-by-quarter over the course of the year. So first, there's Sontiq. Sontiq, we believe, is a long-term mid-teens grower.  Now last year, we didn't have the benefit of a particularly large breach. But we did accelerate our subscription sales with Sontiq, which is especially valuable because of the high recurring nature. In '23, Sontiq grows in the mid-teens. On the indirect side, in '23, we expect to return to mid-single digits growth. And then in the direct subscriptions to consumers, the first half of the year, we're still declining because of the change in marketing spend and practices. But by the second half of the year, in the fourth quarter, in particular, we think we get that behind us. So net-net, those are kind of the dynamics that we see in direct-to-consumer. Todd, any particular comments on the margin profile go forward? Yes, thanks for the question, Toni. Well, look, I mean, right now, we're facing some challenging market conditions in lending verticals in developed markets, and I think it's easy perhaps to get a bit more pessimistic about those things. But we're talking about \u2013 we've got three full years to get there. We have a variety of paths to get there.  We expect that over this period that market conditions generally are going to improve materially. And what we've seen is that our business has the potential to grow very rapidly coming out of downturns. We did so in the 2010 time frame. We did so again coming out of the pandemic where we posted 13% enterprise growth and again, there are a whole variety of different ways to get there. I would point out that our results in this particular quarter generally are tempered a bit by volumes in fintech.That said, the reason we went into the detail on that space and our commentary is we wanted to \u2013 we wanted the market to understand just how growthful that business has been. It's been a nice cherry on top of our overall lending portfolio.  And we think that the growth coming from disruption in that space is going to continue. There's just been a bit of a pause, some caution, as players try to understand market conditions and funding sources and the like. So I think we're going to get disproportionate growth out of fintech, out of Neustar, out of the resurgence in Emerging Verticals and then India. India is becoming really material for us. It grew by 1/3 last year. And while we don't have that rate of growth in our plan, we've got a heck of a lot of upside and we've got a lot of ambitions to expand the number of markets that we play in, in India. So I mean, look, perhaps we revisit this at the end of the year. But at this point, I think, again, we can get there. There are a multitude of different paths. And then I think you were more focused on EPS, and I'm going to let Todd take that one. Yes and again, just to reiterate, we're very focused on driving as much growth as we can out of the new acquisitions and taking costs out. We're happy to be able to raise the guide to $80 million in synergies from Neustar. And look, I hope a year from now, I can come back and share even better news on that front, but we're also focused on paying down our debt. We're hoping to get to 3.5x this year and to take it as low as 3x or below by the end of the following year. That's a lot of interest savings that will benefit the EPS. Yes, Manav, good question on guidance philosophy, but also just kind of some macro insights. So what I'll say is, look, I think you should take us at our word on the guidance for '23, right? We crafted a range after a significant amount of deliberation and thought that we think is reflective of what we can do. Now if economic conditions were to deviate materially in one direction or another, that's a different factor, right? But I mean, we're guiding 3% to 5%. I think you should consider 3% to 5%. And again, if you look at our fourth quarter, we outlined a guidance range, and we delivered within that guidance range for revenue, for EBITDA, and on an operating basis from EPS. The small miss on the EPS was due to a tax item, below-the-line item, right? So I think we would just ask investors to take us our word on the guide, that's where we're targeting. And in terms of the macro stuff, look, I can arm your quarter back with you, but the reality is all of you guys have much smarter and more qualified economists on your staff. So, I am going to pass on that question. Yes, probably the first comment to make on this question is about diversification across the portfolio and how that dynamic is playing out. Without a doubt, our lending lines of business has slowed materially in developed markets because of the effect of inflation, first, and then rising rates. And potentially, may have slowed a little extra because it just uncertainty, right?  When there is uncertainty in the market, transaction volumes fall, right? And as certainty gets restored around the direction of inflation, around the direction of rates, we could see some improvements. But the negative is around the lending volumes. The positive and again, in the U.S., I'll remind you that the emerging verticals are equal in size to the lending verticals, right?  And their growth is increasing. It increased from 1% in the third quarter, which we said was based on anomalous non-recurring factors, to 4%, and we expect it to improve again over the course of '23. The international businesses, there was less fiscal stimulus, so they are not dealing with the same degree of elevated inflation.  They continue to roll. That business is $800million. It's grown \u2013 we've targeted to grow in the low double-digits. There's a lot of momentum there, right? And it's broad-based momentum because our footprint is more skewed. So that's going to be growthful. And then direct-to-consumer because we've had a reset in process over the past 12 months, has been a material drag on our results, and we see that improving substantially over the fourth quarter. Now again, I just want to reiterate in terms of the guidance. We didn't model in a recession, and we didn't model in economic improvement. We took a very challenging macro environment in our fourth quarter and we largely model off of that.  Now again, there's any number of puts and takes given the multitude of verticals and sub-verticals. But we think it's a prudent guide, it's not overly negative, but it's also not founded on some back-end optimism. And again, the reason organic growth rates increased in the latter half of the year is because our comps are much, much easier, particularly in the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 14% on a reported and 17% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 19 points to inorganic revenue and I'll remind you that both Neustar and Sontiq contributed to organic growth beginning in the month of December.  Organic constant currency revenue declined 2%. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2022.  For full year 2022, mortgage represented about 6.5% or about $240 million of our total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14% on a reported and 17% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.6%, down 10 basis points, compared to the year-ago quarter.  Excluding Neustar and Sontiq in October and November, and Argus from the full quarter, the organic constant currency margin would have been 36.8%, up about 110 basis points, compared to the year ago fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 4% with adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense and a higher-than-expected full year adjusted tax rate of 22.4%, compared to our 22% guide. Our full year adjusted tax rate came in almost 0.5 point higher than we anticipated, primarily due to the completion of our analysis of certain tax implications of our recent acquisitions and the final determination of the impact of a change in the U.S. tax law regarding the requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses.  The result was a slightly higher full year adjusted tax rate with a cumulative catch-up recorded in the fourth quarter. I'd point out that our multi-year proactive tax strategy has resulted in an attractive adjusted tax rate and we continue to look at future opportunities to further ensure our tax structure is operating efficiently. Now looking at our segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 23% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic revenue declined 4%, but was up 3%, excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 21% on an as-reported basis and declined 3% on an organic basis. The adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 50 basis points on an organic basis. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that we are now reporting Neustar's financial results to the appropriate verticals. To help you with your modeling, we provided a recast of our 2022 results yesterday in an 8-K filing. The majority of the revenue remained within emerging verticals.  For the full year 2022, Neustar contributed $120 million of revenue, that is now part of financial services. All the results we provide today will be on the recast basis. Financial services revenue grew 6% as reported and was down 10% organically, excluding Argus for the full quarter and Neustar from October and November. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 2%, despite comparing to a 27% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2021, implying a 15% two year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end-markets, consumer lending remained in relatively good shape. Lenders continue to market and originate, even as we saw some modest targeted pullback. In the quarter, revenue declined 4% against 40% growth in the year-ago quarter. Our customers continue to confirm that investors are in market, but focused increasingly on lower-risk consumers and the lenders with the best recent track records. We've also seen balance sheet lenders using this as an opportunity to gain share. As we've done in past soft markets, we will use this as an opportunity to enhance our already strong position with fintech lenders, leveraging our expanded impactful set of solutions to help them understand their customers and make effective decisions through the cycle. Understanding that fintech is of particular interest to investors, let me put our current strong position in historical context. In 2022, total fintech revenue was about $175 million, up 15% over 2021, which had been the largest year ever. The prior largest year was just over $100 million of revenue in 2019.  That means today, we have a business that is almost 75% larger than just three years ago, driven not just by growing volumes, but also by share gains and innovation-led growth. We continue to believe that over the long term, we can continue this very strong growth trajectory as we win new business and expand our share of wallet with existing accounts on the strength of our innovation and the capabilities acquired with Neustar and Argus. Our credit card business had another solid quarter, growing 5% after nearly 30% growth in the year-ago quarter. We have seen consistently strong origination activity for more than a year. To-date, we've observed very limited pullback in customer marketing activity as most lenders are still in strong positions to find opportunities across its spectrum and gain top-of-wallet position with a generally healthy consumer Chris described. Our auto business delivered 14% growth in the quarter. We saw new vehicle sales tick up for the first time this year, days inventory on the dealer lot building and used vehicle prices coming down. These factors set the stage for an industry expectation of a 7% increase in new car production in 2023. We are already experiencing solid market trends in the early weeks of the first quarter.  Used car sales remained somewhat sluggish as higher interest rates tend to have a more pronounced impact in this part of the market. We continue to outperform the underlying market based on wins from the strength of CreditVision Link, which lenders are using to better assess risk in the current environment, ongoing success with our digital prequalification solutions and renewals with key Neustar auto customers. For mortgage, revenue was down 44% in the quarter and down more than 30% for the full year. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market has maintained modest origination levels. And as we've expected, HELOC activity has picked up as consumers use this as an efficient way to realize short-term liquidity. For 2023, we expect the inquiry market to be down mid-20s and our revenue to increase mid-single-digits. We expect to outperform the market on the strength of HELOC activity, increased demand from the targeted marketing solutions lenders are turning to in a very tight market and price increases. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 47% on a reported basis and 4% organically, excluding the revenue associated with Neustar in October and November. Insurance delivered another good quarter, growing despite the slowdown in marketing activity driven by higher repair and replacement cost and the extended time required for carriers to effect rate increases at the state level.  Our attractive portfolio of innovative solutions in commercial and life applications as well as drive a risk in our traditional private auto market have helped offset some of the macro issues in the market. Importantly, we've seen a steady stream of rate approvals on a state-by-state basis that should result in increased marketing activity and consumer shopping, both of which lead to revenue opportunities for TransUnion. Tenant and employment screening growth improved sequentially as a result of early signs of a recovery in the tenant market with month-over-month declines in rental rates and increases in move rates. This growth was somewhat offset by a softer employment screening market as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring. Our media vertical grew again in the quarter despite some modest market softness driven by multiple years of new business wins and accelerating usage levels with existing accounts. We continue to sign new deals and expect further growth in this area from the integrated go-to-market and solution offerings as discussed. Consumer Interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, declined 2% on a reported basis and declined 13% organically. As we discussed in the fourth quarter of 2021, our business benefited from significant breach remediation work last year. Excluding that large one-time business, organic revenue would have declined 5%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 3% and down 5% organically. Similar to the previous two quarters, several factors adversely impacted revenue, moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, challenging multi-year comparisons to exceptionally strong performances in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021 and the comparison to one-time breach-related business.  Our continued strength in identity protection, an area where our Sontiq acquisition enhances our capabilities, partially offsets these factors. To update you on the direct-indirect revenue split with the inclusion of Sontiq, about two-thirds of revenue is indirect and one-third is direct. For my comments international all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 15% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue declined 5%. Excluding the revenue related to onetime contracts and including with the UK government, we would have grown about 3% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. We saw softness with many lenders in the fourth quarter, but have experienced improved trends in January.  At the same time, we had a strong quarter in our game vertical driven by heightened activity levels around the World Cup. Our insurance vertical also delivered good growth as more customers are using TruVision trended credit data for pricing and our consumer business has gained share due to the CreditView platform strength, and we won a large breach contract in large part because of Sontiq and its unique remediation capabilities. Finally, a few weeks ago, we announced an investment in Bud Financial, one of the leading open banking providers in the UK to help drive innovation and growth in the market and support financial inclusion.  Our Canadian business grew 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. Similar to last quarter, the macroeconomic indicators remain soft, yet our business continued to grow as we won material new business ranging from large banks to fintech entrants. These new wins are still ramping up, and we expect to realize the full financial benefits in late 2023. In India, we grew 33%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets, as well as from fraud, employment screening and direct-to-consumer offerings. In Latin America, revenue was up 12% with broad-based growth across our markets including another quarter of growth over 20% for our largest market, Colombia. While macro conditions have generally softened in the region, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintechs and neobanks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of CreditVision and our fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 26% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by new business with fintech players and exceptional growth in the Philippines, which is now running well ahead of pre-COVID levels as the economy is now fully reemerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory. And finally, Africa increased 16% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region despite a challenging environment that includes rolling electrical blackouts and other persistent challenges.  In South Africa, our core business continues to grow on the strength of new business wins and meaningful contract renewals. We also benefited from growth in fast-growing verticals, like telco and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong growth in markets, like Kenya and Zambia, particularly with micro and fintech lenders. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.7 billion of debt after prepaying $200 million in the fourth quarter and another $400 million earlier in 2022 that left us with $585 million of cash on the balance sheet, including the receipt of approximately $104 million of the proceeds from the noncore asset divestiture that Chris already covered.  We finished the year with a leverage ratio of 3.8x. Since our IPO in the summer of 2015, we have targeted a leverage ratio of less than 3.5x. Going forward, we intend to work toward a leverage ratio of less than 3x though as in the past, from time to time our leverage ratio may be higher than our target. With that said, from this chart, you can see that we have to rapidly reduce leverage as a result of our strong adjusted EBITDA growth. What's more, we intend to further prepay debt in 2023 with our excess cash flow. And at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not currently in our plans.  We are focused on absorbing, integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. We have multiple pieces related to our debt as we enter 2023 that impact our net interest expense. I want to spend a minute on these items.  First, our debt stack is unchanged entering 2023, but I wanted to lay out the three tranches with their associated rates on this slide. Second, we use a layering of swap instruments to hedge about 70% of our debt, which allows us the flexibility to execute, meaning prepayments.  At the end of 2022, a swap with $1.4 billion notional value and a rate of 2.7% expired, we replaced that with another with $1.3 billion notional value bought at a higher rate of 4.4%. You'll note this swap is a relatively short duration, expiring in just two years when we can optimistically contemplate a lower interest rate environment. Third, you can see the impact of higher LIBOR on our unhedged debt and the new higher rate swap on the right-hand side of the slide. The forecast uses the current forward curve. Net interest expense is expected to increase by $55 million.  However, and this is a critical point, this does not include any additional prepayment. This is in line with our longstanding practice of not providing speculative guidance about capital allocation, whether related to acquisitions, prepayments or any other activity.  However, for your consideration, as a rule of thumb, based on the current forward curve and on an annualized basis, every $100 million of debt prepayment would add about $0.03 per share to adjusted diluted EPS. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter where we have the most challenging comparisons of the year. For that reason, we expect our growth rates to improve as the year progresses. In the first quarter, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and two points of headwind from FX on adjusted EBITDA.  For revenue, we anticipate about a two point benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $908 million and $917 million or down 1% to flat on an as-reported basis and down 1% to 2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes an approximately two point headwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $316 million, a decrease of 6% to 7%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 190 to 210 basis points as a result of incorporating Argus' relatively lower margins and the impact of revenue mix.  We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.73 and $0.75, a range of down 19% to 21%, a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense. Turning to the full year, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and 1 point of headwind from FX on adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate approximately one point of benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as-reported basis and an organic constant currency basis and is the same excluding mortgage as we expect a minimal full year impact. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single-digits with and without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate financial services with and without mortgage to be up low-single-digits. We expect Emerging Verticals to be up mid-single-digits. We anticipate that international will grow high-single-digits in constant currency terms, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low-single-digits on an organic basis. Turning back to the total company outlook, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion, up 3% to 6%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings, partially offset by the inclusion of Argus' relatively lower margins earlier in the year and some revenue mix considerations. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS declining 1% to 5% with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth. And to help you complete your modeling of 2023 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million.  We anticipate net interest expense will be about $280 million for the full year, up significantly, as I showed you earlier, due to rising rates. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. Our guidance assumes that current market conditions persist and does not incorporate a U.S. recession. Nonetheless, in the event that does happen, as we discussed in detail on our second quarter earnings call, we would still expect organic constant currency revenue growth albeit less than the mid-single-digit guide I just provided.  This growth is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership and innovation. And in this situation, I would expect incremental pressure on adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating our recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations and we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns to the trajectory of revenue growth in order to support our attractive margin structure. I want to wrap up with some extra detail about our expectations for margin expansion in 2023. The bridge on this slide shows the significant benefit we expect to derive from the Neustar cost saving program. We also have good margin flow through from our revenue growth. Partially offsetting these positives are three factors.  First, we have the impact of Argus' lower margin for the first three months of the year as the acquisition closed in April of 2022. Second, we have the year-over-year impact of resetting variable compensation cost to target while also allowing for appropriate increases in employee compensation. And finally, we will have higher royalty costs in U.S. markets. At the same time, we continue to prioritize long-term growth-focused investments in all the areas that Chris discussed this morning. I am pleased to say that we expect to be able to expand the 2023 margin without taking any significant cost actions, largely because we have a long history of prudent, consistent cost management.  For example, in recent years, we've closed dozens of owned or acquired data centers, we've slowed hiring at times to calibrate to our growth and we have excellent expense management processes. Beyond that, we continue to reduce our cost structure and drive savings from the good work of our global operations organization, particularly through our global capability centers that Chris highlighted earlier and there is significant future cost benefits from these initiatives.  With that said, if the situation deteriorates, we have additional actions, like reprioritizing certain investments, managing T&E or other one-time costs that we can execute. We remain focused on maintaining our high quality workforce in order to fully execute all of the exciting projects that we've described in today's call. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Hey, Jeff, good morning. It's Todd. Thanks for the question. I think it's a very appropriate place to start this morning. So, clearly, when you look at our guide compared to the high end that we provided of about $3.885 billion, and you see whereQ1 where we're guiding $917 million at the high end, we definitely see a little bit of an uptick in the revenues from the Q1 levels. And largely, what we're seeing is we feel that we have felt the impact of businesses that are impacted by cyclicality. So, for example, the mortgage business, we definitely expect Q1 of '23 to be a further headwind. But as the year progresses, that those headwinds will start to find an equilibrium point, as well as we were able to take some pricing actions within mortgage that as the year goes on, we'll be able to moderate some of the volume decline. Another area to highlight would be our insurance vertical. We saw some unusual factors in the second half of 2022 with the high repair and replacement costs that our customers were seeing due to supply chain issues and they are in a way to increase their premiums. As you heard in my prepared remarks already this morning, we've started to see that subside. So we're expecting the insurance business to benefit from insurers being back in market \u2013 marketing, as well as consumers shopping for insurance. And just as a reminder, in our insurance vertical, it's not necessarily linked to car sales. It's more about the premiums and the impact to the consumer. So that shopping activity, we anticipate to be a driver as consumers are focused on managing their finances in this high inflationary environment. And to highlight that, too, the reason I just spent as much time as I did on insurance is, it's a large vertical for us now too based on the recast of the Neustar financials that increases the overall size of that business. And just a couple of other areas to highlight, our tenant screening business was another one that we saw some impact in the second half of 2022 as well that we're starting to see those trends subside as consumers are moving, more apartments are coming online, creating more capacity and as a result of that, rents are coming down. And then finally, I think the last one I'd highlight for you, Jeff, would be auto. Our auto business had a good fourth quarter, but what we're hearing from many of the auto manufacturers is the supply chain issues are starting to subside and we're expecting for good growth to come from a new car sales perspective. And similar to how I talked about insurance, the auto business will also benefit, as well from that shopping activity as consumers are looking safe hands. The last point I would make on this is that the guidance that we are assuming does have a sense of returning back to what I would consider to be normal seasonality for our business. So where Q1 looks a little bit light normally, you'd see Q2 and Q3 step up and Q4 maybe be a little bit less. So that's also been factored into our guidance, as well. Yes, good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. So specifically, to the margin and you see almost a 50 point decline there. A couple of factors go into that. First of all, from a compensation perspective, since the second half of last year, TransUnion has been very focused on ensuring that we are making our hiring decisions on important strategic priorities for us. So we continue to fill roles that have that importance for us.  But when \u2013 and when we look forward, we're very proud of the talented team that we have and all the work that they accomplished in 2022 with acquisitions and organic initiatives, we felt that it was important to make certain that we're fully recognizing the extraordinary work of our people by providing the compensation necessary to increase for our merit and promotion pool as well. In addition, we also needed to reset our variable compensation up to target levels when you compare to what the payouts were in 2022. . A second thing to cover here would just be when you think about our volumes in areas where we are experiencing year-over-year declines in volumes, it's important to note that those declining volumes have a higher margin impact than any type of pass-through pricing markup that we would have on a higher royalty expense as an example. So that's the second important factor to go into there and I think third, and really getting back to the point just on our people, we are continuing to invest in several organic initiatives.  We're not sacrificing the long-term growth potential of TransUnion. So we continue to have meaningful investments in initiatives. Chris just covered several of them when he went through the global enablement platforms, and I think those areas really underscore the investments that we make to make certain that TransUnion is a growing and resilient company in the future. Yes. So the first thing I would add on the margin is the Consumer Interactive business always has had an attractive margin profile with adjusted EBITDA margin in the upper 40% range, sometimes to 50%. And clearly, that's what we just saw in the fourth quarter.  So as we look forward into 2023, and Chris just spoke about the direct business, and that's really where the opportunity resides for us to gain efficiencies and optimize our advertising spend, the team has done a great job with that. So as a result, we would expect that the margin for this business would be in the same range that we've had historically. So in that high 40s to around 50% adjusted EBITDA margin. So from an EPS point of view, I mean, one of the significant drags that we've had is the rise in the \u2013 in LIBOR, which our debt is still tied to for the time being. So that has a rather significant impact on the EPS. In 2023, we had an impact of about $0.22. So think of it another way. Our \u2013 the guide on EPS would be up another 22% if interest rates were, like roughly flat $0.22. So, if you now think about that over the next three years, if you believe that interest rates decline, TransUnion and the rest of the market, we get a natural benefit there. So not an operating factor, but it wasn't an operating factor that provided this headwind, as well. And just to underscore that point, as we always do with our guidance, we do not make assumptions on capital allocation decisions with cash that builds. So to that point, if you look at our guide for '23 and then even out into the future, those paydowns are not incorporated into the overall adjusted diluted EPS, as well."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. I'll first discuss the economic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world and then provide an overview of our solid in range financial results for the third quarter. I'll also review the encouraging performance of our recent acquisitions and the strong progress we've made to deliver our targeted savings, revenue acceleration, and sharing of their market leading technologies across the enterprise. Todd will then take the reins and review in detail our third quarter results and our full year guidance. Thus far in 2022, consumer financial health has remained positive versus pre-pandemic conditions supporting growth across TransUnion, especially in our emerging markets. Consumer employment, income, spending, balance sheets and credit performance have been strong year-to-day. However, the dramatic increase in inflation globally, especially in our developed markets of the U.S., the U.K. and Canada, have begun to pressure household finances leading to a reduction in savings rates, increasing credit balances, and modestly higher credit delinquencies. As a result, businesses have adopted a more cautious outlook given rising market uncertainties. In the U.S., the U.K. and Canada year-to-date, soaring inflation and higher interest rates have primarily impacted below prime consumers. Emerging markets such as India and South Africa have digested higher inflation and other challenges and still delivered strong growth. We expect this positive performance to continue in the foreseeable future. In the U.S., higher inflation and interest rates have negatively impacted several of our businesses. Increased borrowing costs due to higher rates has decimated mortgage refinanced volumes and slowed new purchases due to an imbalance between historically high home prices and dramatically decreased affordability. And as we discussed last quarter, a shortage of multifamily housing along with higher home ownership costs has caused rental rates to skyrocket and move volumes to decline precipitously negatively impacting our tenant screening business. And although performance in our credit card and consumer lending verticals remain strong, lenders have reduced new customer acquisition in response to growing pressure on household finances and prioritize customer retention and portfolio risk assessment. Growth in the auto market also remains positive, albeit constrained by the well publicized supply chain challenges. And our large bank customers during their recent earnings calls indicated that while the U.S. consumer remains strong, they are preparing their balance sheets for the material economic headwinds they anticipate in 2023. Higher inflation has similarly dampened marketing activity in the insurance industry with carriers prioritizing rate increases over customer acquisition due to rising repair and replacement costs. Given the complexity insurers face obtaining rate increase approvals for the policies they offer in each state in which they operate, it will take some time before they secure the necessary price increases to resume their full marketing activity. We believe that carriers will succeed in obtaining higher coverage rates, and that once they do our insurance vertical will return to its typical high single digit to low double-digit growth rate as carriers resume marketing and consumer shop for the best coverage and price. And finally, activity remained brisk for our marketing services products in the quarter. Although, we anticipate that as economic uncertainty grows, brand owners, media companies and ad agencies will reduce volumes in certain end markets with the greatest risk coming in 2023. And now turning to our third quarter performance. We posted solid results within our guidance range despite increasingly difficult conditions due to the economic pressures I previously discussed. Our strength in the quarter came from several verticals in the U.S. and our International segment overall. U.S. financial services grew 9%, excluding mortgage on top of healthy 31% growth in the year ago quarter. Our media vertical grew double-digits and insurance also posted mid single digit growth, despite the carrier marketing slowdown. And International grew by 16% on a constant currency basis, with five of our six regions growing double-digits led by 39% growth in India, 24% growth in Asia-Pacific, and 18% growth in Africa. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA margins at the high end of our range, reflecting our high flow through margins, cost savings from the Neustar acquisition and prudent expense management overall. And as I will discuss in a moment, our acquisitions performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we continue to build revenue momentum and achieve our cost synergies. Given the increasingly challenging market conditions, we have reduced our fourth quarter and full year guidance to reflect the impact of higher inflation across the markets we serve. We've also broadened our guidance range, given the economic uncertainties. First, FX headwinds worsened in the quarter and we now estimate an incremental $12 million reduction in the fourth quarter as a result. We expect the unusually strong U.S. dollar to persist throughout 2023 and temper the impact of the strong performance of our International segment. Second, for the fourth quarter, we reduced U.S. mortgage revenues by a further $7 million, still within our prior range of 30% to 35% down, but now trending to the lower end of the range. Third, we reduced revenue expectations across the non-mortgage U.S. markets portfolio by $33 million across the base of approximately $2.1 billion due to softening market conditions. And finally, I want to emphasize that we did not reduce our outlook for International, given the strong performance year-to-date and continuing positive conditions in our emerging markets. We continue to monitor our performance closely in our 30-plus non-U.S. markets and our management teams continue to perform well despite higher inflation and interest rates, and even rolling electrical blackouts in South Africa. We also maintain our estimates in consumer interactive as it remains on track to achieve the targets we outline in the last quarter. But now turning to our three acquisitions. We've made substantial progress integrating them into TransUnion this year. Each acquisition is on track against our business cases and the expectations we set on prior calls. Importantly, we believe our results thus far and the market feedback we've received proves the rationales for the deals and the power of combining them in a TransUnion. Starting with Neustar, revenue grew mid single digits in the corner, in line with our full year expectations across marketing, fraud and communications. In our increasingly integrated TransUnion and Neustar marketing solutions grew high single digits year-to-date. As we continue to execute against our growth pipeline, we announced meaningful new marketing sales during the quarter to iHeartRADIO, Stirista, and InfoSum, as well as a partnership with Snowflake. Despite industry caution about future advertising levels, we see strong interest in the full family of Neustar marketing solutions, which provide benefits throughout market cycles. In a tighter advertising environment, marketers seek to optimize their spending and demonstrate the impact of their campaigns with reliable quantitative measures. With the decline in digital identifiers, marketing platform providers also need to prove the impact of advertising within their walls. Neustar is well-positioned to provide these objective metrics on marketing -- on the marketing performance of these sites. In communications, we signed new business with LiveVox and Transaction Network Services during the quarter. We also continue to see meaningful growth from our innovative family of Trusted Call Solutions, which include branded call display, and caller name optimization. Both help businesses authoritatively identify themselves and reestablish trust in phone-based outreach to consumers, as 88% of all business calls go unanswered due to the proliferation of robo calling, scam calls and blocked or unknown numbers. Companies across a wide spectrum of markets, including financial services, insurance collections, healthcare and utilities use Trusted Call Solutions to double or even triple call pickup rates, sales and conversion rates. We have almost a thousand customers using this solution and we're added to the T-Mobile network last year in the AT&T network this year. At this stage, we estimate that we've tapped under 10% of the potential U.S. market sending us up for significant future growth. Going forward, we expect that our growth will accelerate through successful cross-selling between Neustar and TransUnion. We continue to sign new insurance collections and financial services accounts for Trusted Call Solutions and converted several material opportunities in quarter and are building our sales pipeline for next year. We also continue to successfully integrate TransUnion superior data assets into Neustar state-of-the-art data management platform, OneID, into realize cost savings and performance improvements. Our combined data assets have increased our phone coverage by 15%, email coverage by 10%, and improved the robust linking and matching capabilities across our non-credit solutions. And as part of our plan cost synergies, we expect to close seven data centers this year, reducing Neustar's physical footprint by over 90%. We've also migrated almost 90% of their products in data management services to a new lower cost public cloud provider. To wrap up, Neustar's adjusted EBITDA margins margin was about 29% in the third quarter, driven by revenue growth and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect the full year margin to also be 26%, up 500 basis points from 2021. We also have line of sight to achieving our commitment of 70 million-plus in cost savings through integrating Neustar, which we expect will provide a meaningful offset to potential margin compression during an economic slowdown or a full blown recession. Now turning to Sontiq. Revenue grew in the mid teens, with a low thirties margin in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction with insurance customers both domestically and abroad, with more than 40% of newly identified opportunities coming internationally. We also have a growing pipeline of opportunities in financial services. And as we mentioned last quarter in consumer interactive, we can now win business. We would not have been previously able to through TransUnion and Sontiq combined strength. This combination has resulted in an eight figure win for our indirect business that we expect to monetize in 2023. Finally, Argus revenue grew 4% in the quarter at a margin of 19%. For the full year, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, with the 20% margin, or 34% excluding integration costs. We've already seen strong levels of customer interest, both from consortium members and non-members interested in joining and finding new ways to use the Argus data and insights, revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TransUnion's digital platforms, as well as infusing our thought leadership will be key to realizing higher sales levels. That wraps up my update on our market backdrop, third quarter performance and the integration of our three acquisitions. Now, Todd will walk you through our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thanks Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 26% on a reported and 29% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 27 points to revenue and organic constant currency growth was 1%. Our business grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2021 and 2022. On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 7.5% of our revenue, and we expect that to fall to below 7% for the full year.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a reported and 15% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, down 430 basis points compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by Neustar's lower margin profile. Excluding the Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus acquisitions, the margin would've been 38.6%, down about 200 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 2% driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense. Now looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. market's revenue was up 38% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic revenue declined 2%, what was up 5% excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 18% on an as reported and declined 9% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 610 basis points, but would've been down 300 basis points, excluding the Neustar and Argus acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that to date we have included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial services revenue grew 5% as reported and was down 4%, excluding Argus. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 9%, despite 31% growth in the third quarter of 2021, implying a 20% two-year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continues to be strong as high levels of activity persisted throughout the quarter, leading to 10% growth on top of almost 60% in the year ago quarter. While lower marketing activity reveals some softness emerging and below prime credit tiers, we are seeing FinTech lenders recalibrate their activity from customer acquisition to retention. We are also seeing incremental activity around debt consolidation, which had slowed considerably in 2020 and 2021 when consumer balance sheets reached their peak. At the same time, we continue to see growth from our strong BNPL position. Similarly, our credit card business had another good quarter, growing 9% after growth of nearly 30% in the year ago quarter. Issuers continued to fight for top of wallet position driving all channel marketing spend, as well as incremental use of alternative data in more sophisticated tools for pre-qualification and origination. While we haven't seen pullback in this activity yet, we are taking a cautious stance regarding fourth quarter activity. Our auto business delivered high single digit growth in the quarter as new business wins and on trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing helped offset lingering inventory issues for new and used vehicles. While demand remains relatively strong, we are beginning to see some softening caused by consumer affordability challenges driven by elevated vehicle prices and interest rates. To this point, the average new vehicle price in the U.S. is expected to rise to about $45,000 this year, a staggering increase of $10,000 over the past two years. For mortgage, rates have continued to rise with the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage up more than a point from the end of the second quarter and more than double what it was a year ago. This is substantially affected the total inquiry market, especially refinances. For the full year, we continue to expect the inquiry market to be down 40% to 45% and our revenue to fall 30% to 35%. We designed our late July outlook to be conservative and to anticipate further headwinds, including higher rates and inflation without much if any reduction in home prices. Backdrop has largely played out as we expected, and therefore we are not altering our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect our business to perform better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases. Increased demand for targeted marketing solutions as the market tightens and increased interest in home equity lending products like HELOCs as a result of substantial home equity increases. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 91% on a reported basis and 1% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. Insurance delivered another good quarter with mid single digit growth, despite the slowdown in marketing, Chris described and building on a very strong year ago quarter when revenue was up more than 20%. We continue to see strength from our innovative solutions in commercial and life applications, as well as DriverRisk in our traditional private auto market. As Chris mentioned, in addition to these organic opportunities, our recent acquisitions are driving significant incremental growth opportunities. Our public sector vertical decline in the quarter due to the timing of several deals. We remain confident that this business will return the growth in the fourth quarter. Tenant and employment screening grew slightly as a result continued softness in the tenant market driven by fewer renters moving as inventory levels have tightened and rental rates have risen sharply. Employment screening, a smaller portion of this vertical continues to deliver attractive growth. Though, we've seen signs of softness as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring. Our media vertical grew double-digits again in the quarter, and we continue to sign or expand contracts with leading social platforms and media companies that serve a broad range of categories. Consumer interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, increased 9% on a reported basis and declined 9% organically due to decreases in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, but down 6% excluding Sontiq. Similar to the second quarter, moderating consumer demand for paid credit related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels and challenging multiyear comparisons to exceptionally strong performance in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021, adversely impacted revenue. This is largely a result of a marketplace shift towards freemium offerings for credit monitoring. Partially offsetting this is continued strength in identity protection, an area where our Sontiq acquisition enhances our capabilities. On the indirect side, the restructuring of one of our key partnerships last year and some non-recurring breach revenue have created an unfavorable year-over-year comparison. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 16% with five of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA for International increased 18% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 4%. Excluding the revenue related to the one time contracts including with the U.K. government, we would've grown about 9% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. Notably, higher inflation and political transition have weighed on customer activity and confidence. However, offsetting these forces, we are seeing an acceleration in TrueVision, our trended credit offering in the U.K., along with strength in direct to consumer as three of the four largest lenders now use our CreditView platform, and we're also seeing increased traction in our insurance vertical. Our Canadian business grew 10% in the third quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. While we see macro indicators softening a bit, our core business in the third quarter remains strong as we continue to garner new business ranging from large banks to one of the largest BNPL players. We expect these moves, once fully executed in 2023, will position us as the leader in the Canadian financial service market and the BNPL sector. Also driving growth, we continue to benefit from customers ordering incremental batch, data and analytics to recalibrate their post-COVID models in order to be recession ready. In India, we grew 39% reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation, and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. As a result, we benefit from a third consumer lending and credit card issuance, along with the continued rise of FinTech and BNPL players, all markets where we hold very strong share positions. In Latin America, revenue was up 13% with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in many of our key markets. This strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, ongoing new business wins, shared shifts in financial services, particularly with FinTechs and neobanks and continued uptake of CreditVision, and fraud solutions.  In Asia-Pacific, we grew 24% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by CreditVision's growth, and new business with FinTech players. We expect revenue from the Philippines to double for the full year and to exceed pre-COVID levels as the economy has now fully reemerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory. Finally, Africa increased 18% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region, despite a challenging environment that includes rolling electrical blackouts in consecutive quarters of contracting real GDP in our largest market, South Africa. Notably, we won meaningful new business and secured important contract renewals in South Africa. Outside of South Africa, we have spent years establishing valuable footholds in emerging countries like Kenya and Zambia. We are now seeing the fruits of these investments with meaningful growth in these countries, particularly with micro and FinTech lenders further validating our global IP strategy. Now shifting to leverage and liquidity. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.9 billion of debt, $596 million of cash on the balance sheet, and pro forma leverage of 3.9 times. We expect to delever to 3.8 times by the end of 2022. We also intend to use a portion of our cash to prepaid debt in the fourth quarter. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. All of the guidance provided reflects Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus. Starting with the fourth quarter, we expect about three points of headwind from FX on revenue and four points of headwind from FX unadjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate about a 19 point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $896 million and $916 million, or a 13% to 16% increase on an as reported basis and flat to down 3% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes an approximate four point headwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will grow 2% to 4% on an organic constant currency basis.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $318 million and $333 million, an increase of 13% to 18%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to fall in a range of down 30 to up 50 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and Argus relatively lower margins. On an organic basis, excluding the three acquisitions, we anticipate our margins to increase by more than 150 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.80 and $0.86, a range of down 2% to up 6% negatively impacted by the effect of rising rates and approximately 30% of our debt that is floating. For the full year, we expect FX to impact revenue by about two points. Based on this recent dollar strengthening at current rates, we expect FX to have a negative impact on revenues for the next several quarters. We also anticipate about 24 points of benefit from M&A. We expect revenue to be between $3.704 billion to $3.724 billion up 25% to 26%. Our guidance includes approximately four points headwind for mortgage for the full year. So excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis, we anticipate revenue will increase about 7%. For our business segments on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to grow low single digits, but up high single digits excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be down low single digits, but up low double-digits excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up mid single digits. We anticipate that International will grow in the mid teams on constant currency terms, and we expect consumer interactive to decline in the high single digits on an organic basis. Both International and consumer interactive are on change from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.343 billion and $1.358 billion up 16% to 17%. We expect a two point headwind from foreign exchange. Additionally, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 280 to 260 basis points this year, driven by the lower margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq and Argus. Anticipate the margin will decline about 25 basis points on an organic basis. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $3.63 and $3.69, up 6% to 7%. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22%, slightly lower than our previous guidance. Depreciation and amortization will still be approximately $520 million, and we still expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $210 million. Continue to anticipate net interest expense will be about $225 million for the full year. This implies our interest expense to be roughly $65 million in the fourth quarter. And as you think about interest expense modeling, roughly 68% of our debt is currently swapped from floating to fixed. We have 1.4 billion notional swaps that are expiring at the end of the year, which fixed the variable rates on that notion at 2.7%. We expect to renew that swap before the end of the year, but it is likely to come at a higher swap rate given higher and rising rates. As I noted, we will continue to focus on expected debt prepayment in the coming quarters, which will effectively reduce our floating rate exposure over time. Finally, we still expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% revenue. Looking ahead the 2023 as usual, we'll provide you with guidance when we report our full year results next February. However, I think it's valuable to summarize some important considerations as we head into next year assuming these macroeconomic challenges persist. First and most important, we expect to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth at an attractive margin. To that point right now, we believe that mortgage inquiry volumes will decline again in 2023 with comparisons easing as we go through the year. The next two points relate back to Chris's commentary. One, the consumer in the U.S. remains relatively healthy and that bodes well for our financial services vertical, excluding mortgage. Though, we are diligently watching for any material changes. And two, some of the headwinds we're experiencing in our emerging verticals are temporal and should resolve themselves next year. We continue to expect strong performance in our International business building on an impressive 2022. And in consumer interactive, we believe that business performance will improve as we lap the contract renegotiations and some of the headwinds in direct while also benefiting from the new business wins we've discussed. As Chris also mentioned, we're seeing a very nice new business pipeline develop across all three of our acquisitions. Specific to Neustar, we have a very successful cost reduction program that is running ahead of our $70 million expectation at this point, and we expect we'll continue to deliver meaningful savings next year. And finally, my current expectation is that free cash flow will be directed to debt prepayment, helping reduce our exposure to interest rate increases. At the same time, assuming we deliver more adjusted EBITDA dollars, that will help further reduce our leverage ratio. Now pivoting to some thoughts about a more severe downturn. On our last earnings call, I spent time detailing some puts and takes relative to how our business might respond in a recession. I won't comprehensively review that story today as you can revisit the transcript at your convenience. However, I do want to reiterate the conclusion of that discussion. First, in a somewhat normal recession, we still expect our business to deliver revenue growth, and we would prioritize protecting our margins without sacrificing important investments and our commitments to integrate our recent acquisitions. This is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership and innovation. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating our recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations, and we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns the trajectory of revenue growth in order to deliver strong margin performance. I want to wrap up with a slide we showed you at our Investor Day in March of this year. Despite some of the market cyclicality we're seeing and anticipating, we still expect to deliver against these targets in 2025. Clearly, we don't expect the growth to be linear, but our attractive end markets and geographic footprint, differentiated in complimentary solution offerings and innovation pipeline give us line of sight to fulfilling our long-term commitment. I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thanks Todd. So to conclude, TransUnion delivered another good quarter of growth at an attractive margin. We also continue to make meaningful progress integrating our recent acquisitions and clear top and bottom line benefits are emerging. We have appropriately recalibrated our guidance to reflect current market conditions. And while the broader environment remains uncertain, TransUnion continues to execute at a high level, giving us confidence that we can whether whatever economic uncertainty lies ahead, even as we continue to make growth oriented investments. And before I conclude my remarks, I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge yesterday's announcement by the Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Sandra Thompson, concerning evolutions in the mortgage underwriting space. We were pleased by Director Thompson's announcement to share the FHFA's perspective that safety and soundness and expanding home ownership are the twin objectives for any reform efforts. We're optimistic that the requirement of VantageScore 4.0 score use by mortgage lenders will responsibly and sustainably expand credit access for consumers and also in time increase competition and innovation in the space. We're also equally focused on the announcement that the FHFA and the GSEs will launch a multiyear program to adopt requirements that lenders use two, rather than three credit reports for mortgage originations. We anticipate that we will play a leading role engaging with the stakeholders across the mortgage industry in the coming years, especially the FHFA as we work on appropriate implementation timelines and details. And so taking together the adoption of VantageScore 4.0, and then the migration over time from a tri-merge to a bi-merge requirement will reshape the mortgage landscape and present new opportunities for TU to sell both existing solutions, but also encourage the development of new and novel customer data products. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, as always we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And operator, we can begin the Q&A now.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I understand your slide 17 is a no recession in kind of assumption in slide 18. Is what if a recession assumption? So I want to focus on slide 17. And the TransUnion team is suggesting that 2023 will have solid organic revenue growth, but below the long-term, 8% to 10% target. So, I just wanted to know, when you say solid organic revenue growth, does that mean mid single digits organic revenue growth? And what's your macro assumption kind of underlying that?\nTodd Cello: Hey, good morning Andrew, and thanks for the question. This is Todd. I'll take that. As far as slide 17 is concerned, really what we're trying to get across is that -- just our initial thinking as we're exiting 2022 and going into the New Year, as you can probably fully appreciate, we are not in a position at this point in time to provide guidance. Clearly, we're going to see how the macro environment plays out for the rest of the year and even into the New Year before we provide any guidance. So, as far as, to your question about, are we going to guide us? Are we talking about a specific percentage, a 7% to 8%? We didn't put that on the slide because, we're not certain right now as far as how things are going to play out. But what we felt was important was to give the market and our investors a perspective on just what it is that we're feeling right now. And based on the current trajectory that we are experiencing in the economy, we feel that we are going to deliver organic growth. That growth rate still to be determined, could potentially be in line with our long-term growth rate, but we don't know yet. As I'm sure many companies don't, and we provide the color just to give a directional sense as to what we're seeing. So, just to kind of go through that again, in mortgage we're expecting that to continue to decline next year. We just see no inflation pressures continuing to be very elevated. And as a result of that interest rates will respond accordingly. As it pertains to the rest of the U.S., our financial services business, I say arguably, in the third quarter still had a strong performance. The growth rates were still very good. They were lower than, clearly what we had outlined, but nevertheless, still strong performance and especially when you compare that to the growth rates that we lapped last year I think it was pretty strong quarter there. But we're cautiously watching the U.S. consumer to see -- how they, how they react to this. I'd say the emerging verticals, the growth rate that we experienced in the quarter being at about 1%. There's a lot of kind of -- as we say on the slide, idiosyncratic issues that are impacting that. And we fully expect that to normalize when we get into 2023. And I would just say that our International business continues to be very -- continues to be very strong, and resilient at this point. But again, we're watching more of the developed markets like Canada and the U.K. And then finally, I think the big positive and Chris highlighted this in his comments is that the acquisitions perform very well for us in the third quarter. Neustar was on our revenue expectations and the integration is well on track. And we've been able to secure the cost synergies that we committed to a year ago when we announced the deal, we're getting there. We're confident to achieve at least the $70 million that we communicated. Sontiq strong quarter, integration going well, and Argus as well. The business has rebounded nicely. So, we feel that the momentum even there on the M&A side is definitely in our favor as well.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay. Great. Thanks Todd.\nOperator: The next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. In terms of the -- as a follow up to the earlier question, in terms of the -- whether it's the 4Q outlook or 2023, can you just talk about the level of visibility or comfort that you have currently versus maybe under more normalized times? When I look back over the last two quarters, it seems it's been quite challenging to even predict the quarterly numbers. And so things seem to be changing faster than anticipated. Any color there.\nTodd Cello: Sure. Thanks for the question on that. And I think it's more of a question pertaining to our guidance for the fourth quarter. And clearly, we have revised down from where we were at just 90 days ago roughly in our July call. And I think it's just -- it's the read from our customers and what they're telling us right now. So, just to get into a little bit of the detail. If you look at the bridge that we provided where we showed the reduction we're showing in the U.S. markets ex-mortgage that we're going to be down about $33 million. Roughly half of that is coming from financial services, including consumer lending, card and auto. But even with us taking those numbers sound like I just said in my response to Andrew's question, we're still expecting good growth rates out of those lines of business. The remainder is just more about the other verticals in our emerging verticals like tenant, tenant screening, which Chris talked about in his prepared remarks, talked about the pressures that we're seeing there, but also just maybe a little bit slowing in the media as well as in the insurance spaces, but still growing, nevertheless. So, what we've done is we've taken our outlook based on the activity we're seeing from our customers, but also just in regards to what they're telling us as well, too. And that's the reason for the reduction that we took in our guide. But things are uncertain. And we told you that when we met with you in July, and we have a wider than normal range for our guidance in the fourth quarter similar to like what we had done in the third quarter. And you can see that we delivered in range in the third quarter. So, we feel that we've captured market sentiment as well as derisked the guidance by having a wider range.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. So, I would just add one small thing to that, which is you did -- you started by saying it's a more difficult environment to forecast, and we agree with that. And Todd take you through the mechanics of how we've tried to be prudent in our fourth quarter guidance and anticipate some of those trends. In circumstances like these, it's easy to focus on the negatives, the deceleration against prior year performance. Prior year performance, that was absolutely very high, by the way, we're reinforcing. But there are also some positives as you look forward into next year. One, mortgage will be less of a drag, if a drag at all, to be determined than it was -- this year, International will continue to be strong. We expect a material improvement in the performance of our direct consumer business. We think the tenant screening market will become unstuck. So, there are a variety of positives that will happen as the market works toward an equilibrium. And again, as I said, we're laser focused on what's going on in the market. We're going to use -- the fourth quarter will be instructional, and then we'll provide our guidance in the early part of next year and a more robust discussion around what we're anticipating.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yeah. Thanks. Chris, would love your perspective as competition could play out for share in a bi-merge world. What's the pitch for why TransUnion should be included as one of the two? I'd imagine the industry leading trended product is a big part of it, but just what else? And then, is this also a catalyst for bringing additional alternative data products into the mortgage underwriting process from your perspective? Thanks.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. Well, look, it's kind of early days based on the announcement that we just received yesterday. I think the win for consumers and the win for the mortgage industry and the economy is that we'll now be using a score that we know scores more consumers in the U.S. and scores them more accurately. So, it is a win for financial inclusion and mortgage origination generally. We also like the emphasis on safety and soundness by the FHFA and the GSEs. The two factors that go into that is one scoring accuracy, which I feel like they've addressed by requiring the VantageScore, but also just the volume and breadth of information. Now, they've indicated that they're going to suggest or recommend a change in the mortgage credit report market. I think we need time to better understand what exactly that means. The agency hasn't released its details nor an implementation plan. In an environment where there is more competition, be it around score or credit, we do have a great trended credit product. We are an industry neutral player and we've got a wide range of data. And I think this will, net-net, just set off a period of innovation that could be quite helpful to the space and the consumers and the bureaus alike. But I think it's a little early now given some of these uncertainties and unknowns to kind of declare what the future is going to look like.\nJeffrey Meuler: Fair enough. Appreciate your perspective. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Hey, Chris and Todd. With India now 5% of total revenues and U.S. mortgages basically expected to be less than 7%, maybe we can switch gears a little bit and talk about what's happening in India. Obviously, this March -- this quarter, you're seeing 39% constant currency growth. Could you just break that down a little bit in terms of how much of that is driven by market growth versus market share gains versus cross-selling additional products and services?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. Well, look, I -- we just got back from an extended trip in India where we spend time not only in Mumbai with our leading credit franchise, but also in Chennai and other parts where we've got a lot of our employees, our development talent and BPO as well. As always, it's a very invigorating experience to spend time in India, particularly with our business. India is very much emerging on the global stage economically, for sure and even politically. And you sense a tremendous optimism when you're over there. We have certainly benefited from the underlying -- the positive growth drivers in that market. Hundreds of millions of Indian citizens have entered the middle class. There's an equal tranches along the way. The government there is committed to aggressive economic growth by taking advantage of kind of the era of intellectual product and India's very kind of progressive approach to digitizing their economy. So, we're benefiting from market trends. We also think we have reinforced or gained share along the way. And we're also diversifying our product line. I mean we, of course, are bringing in the full complement of products around consumer credit and analytics, and we expect considerable growth through the broadening of the product line there. We're making a similar play in commercial where we've really improved the competitiveness of our commercial credit bureau. And we continue to innovate. We've launched a score that will help commercial lenders evaluate small to medium businesses, a very fast growing and dynamic segment of the Indian economy and also a suite of products for agricultural lending, which, again, is an underpenetrated part of the Indian market. So, the combination of natural market growth plus broadening our product line across segments and adjacencies, I think, really positions us for strong growth for years ahead in India.\nKelsey Zhu: Thanks. Really appreciate that. \nOperator: The next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the credit card and consumer lending piece of the business, because it feels like there can be quite a lot of volatility there. So, maybe help us think through as we look ahead to 2023, a potential recession, sort of what are the range of outcomes there? And what type of metrics should we be watching?\nChristopher Cartwright: Sure. Well, our financial services businesses breaks down into the four subsegments: cards, consumer loans, auto and of course, mortgage. Mortgage is far and away the most volatile component of that. Mortgage was a great counterbalance during the downturn related to COVID, and it more than doubled in a couple of years because of the lower interest rates. Now the rates have reversed themselves. It's being halved again. So that's where the real volatility is. Auto's growth currently is constrained. Demand far exceeds supply currently. We would expect supply conditions to improve over time. And so, we're expecting relative stability on the auto side. And look, credit cards and consumer loans, while the growth rate has declined, it's still growing nicely. And card originations are healthy. Although, card marketing activity has tapered somewhat. The same is true on consumer loans. And the FinTechs remains strong and fast growing and we expect them to grow throughout the cycle, because they are disrupting the space. They are in aggressive growth mode. They continue to market. They continue to have secure funding sources. And so, while I think we're entering a period of likely slower growth at least until we find an equilibrium with inflation and interest rates, we do expect the space, financial services that is to remain a positive grower.\nFaiza Alwy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Chris, maybe just a follow-up on that. Let's just say the macro is more just soft. Historically, how has credit card performed or held up? And maybe if you could just give us something similarly around Neustar well in that scenario.\nChristopher Cartwright: Well, let me handle Neustar. And then, Todd, the question was -- there is a slowdown scenario and then perhaps a scenario of deep recession, if you will. And we're not making a guess as to which one it is at this point, but Manav is trying to understand how far credit card can drop in a recession scenario and just given your experience, helping to manage the business through 2008. Any perspective you want to share?\nTodd Cello: Yeah. Sure. So, as far as -- I think what's important to -- when you think about TransUnion is to think about the breadth of offerings that we have for our customers. So, where credit card marketing could potentially slowdown in a recessionary environment, and that clearly would have an impact on our prescreen marketing jobs that we produce. We do have a whole host of services on a portfolio review basis, meaning how do we help our clients manage their existing book of business. And we find that incredibly beneficial during a downturn, maybe not completely countercyclical, but it definitely is an offsetting element of it, because our customers, first, they'll look at their existing book just to understand the risk that they potentially have, but they'll also look at it -- and how to manage lines of credit, but they'll also look at it as a way to cross-sell. So, if they have a certain subset of their portfolio that's performing well, they'll look for opportunities within their own portfolio to broaden their services. The most recent example of that is in the early days of the pandemic. All of our customers shifted like almost overnight from an acquisition perspective to more of a portfolio review. And our sales team was extremely proactive in bringing those offerings to the market. And that's an important point. I know you're asking about credit cards, but I want to go back to the question just in regards to the consumer lending and the FinTech space. Chris already said, we are continuing to see very healthy amounts of marketing for the same reason that I just talked about and learnt. Now don't forget that TransUnion has relationships with 24 of the top 25 FinTechs, and we have deep partnerships with them. So, when they're marketing -- if it does slowdown, we have that same set of portfolio of products that we're going to offer to them. So -- and the relationships that we have with these clients are outstanding. So, we fully believe that we'll be able to help them better manage their business in any [indiscernible].\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. And just on the card side, Manav, I would say that while we're definitely in a slowdown period. We are selling very effectively. 2021 was a record level of sales for us, and we're poised to exceed it materially in 2022 on the financial services side. So, what we're doing in the market is resonating and putting new customers and the like and expanding share within customers is somewhat of an offset as now to the downturn. You also asked about Neustar. I break that down [technical difficulty]. If you look back to the pandemic year of 2020, Neustar win by 1% across its three lines of business. Marketing was flat. And remember the second quarter was quite a shock to the system, and then we had a slow rebound in the third quarter, and we started to approach something like normalcy in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's a good test case for how the business would perform if it's really, really, really bad as it was in 2020. The other thing I'd just mention is that Neustar marketing solutions have value across the business cycle. The vast majority of it is subscription versus subscription like. And the components are cleansing data hygiene so that you're only mailing one-time or are gaining digitally one-time for a consumer, right? So you eliminate waste, extremely important in a downturn, as is the media mix that you're planning and the measurement of the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, if anything, those things become more important in a more constrained environment, right? Now 20% of the marketing portfolio is more volume influenced. That's the audience generation and utilization. We're already -- we've already seen that a bit on the Neustar side, and we've talked about that over the course of the year. On the TransUnion side of the house where we have -- also have similar data, but some unique things. We're growing pretty rapidly. And if you look at marketing together, and increasingly, we have to as we integrate, the marketing part of TransUnion is growing double-digits, right? So, that is encouraging. Anyway -- so that's what I can offer you on those two topics.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. You talked about some of the idiosyncratic, I guess, challenges or headwinds you're facing right now in your Emerging Verticals segment. And you help us understand kind of what's driving those. But I guess I'd love to kind of hear more about what gives you confidence in [technical difficulty] into next year. And a little bit more -- when should those things start to inflect and kind of how long it takes to work themselves out, that would be really helpful. Thanks.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. Heather, I'll start off and I'll focus on the first part of your question, because the timing of these things that may be a degree of precision that's just tough at this point. But look, the largest component of emerging verticals is the insurance business. And it grew mid single digits. That's off of a comp from a year ago period of 20% growth, right? And the main reason why it slowed from its typical high single, low double-digit pace is because of inflation impacting or increasing the cost of repairing and replacing damages, right? So, claims expenses on policies are up, and carriers need to charge more for those policies. But the mechanisms by which they can raise prices are complicated in the U.S. Insurance is a regulated product in all 50 jurisdictions, product-by-product. So, they are currently implementing the rate increase filings across their competitive landscape. It will take some time for those increases to be ratified. And once they are, they will resume new policy origination full force. And so, we expect that to recover. And we have seen this period in the insurance kind of business cycle multiple times before. The other unusual element is the degree of slowdown around tenant screening. And frankly, there's just -- there's kind of a boycott in the market. And you are starting to read about it in the mainstream press. Price increases on apartment rentals in the multifamily space, in particular, have been really considerable and compounding, and now tenants are just not able to or not willing to move. And whenever there's a supply/demand imbalance, it takes a little bit of time to work it out where we start transacting again. I'm confident we are going to find that equilibrium. We are going to start transacting again. And the one bright spot in new home construction, if you will, is multifamily rental units. It will take some time for that supply to come online, but that's going to be helpful in the intermediate term to increasing the transactional volume. Public sector is truly an anomaly. We had some big one-time work in the third quarter of last year, and we also had a new sale that pushed to the fourth quarter. And those two things led to a down quarter. We don't expect a down quarter in the fourth quarter and we expect this area to continue to grow nicely for us. In communications, look, we had two major communications clients. They're big fraud client users merge. And as they digested the merger, they've recalibrated their need for the product at a lower level. We maintain the exclusive supply relationship, but we've had to reduce our transaction volume that happens with M&A. The good news is they're still our client, but their dollar volume fell a bit. The last component is collections. Collections has been a very difficult area for many years here. I'm more encouraged about our ability to grow collections, because the amount of stimulus or support being provided by the government is kind of running its course. And deferral and moratoriums and the like on debt collection or evictions are ending. And so, in 2023, I think we're turning a page and entering a more normal environment where we're going to get some growth in the collections area. So that's the various puts and takes that made, I think, Q3 anomalous in our emerging markets. And hopefully, I help you understand it better.\nTodd Cello: And Chris, I would just add on to it. [Technical difficulty] year in 2023, our Neustar business will be considered organic.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah.\nTodd Cello: At that point in time and for the reasons Chris gave pertaining to marketing, I think it's also important to highlight the risk in the fraud business that we have now in conjunction with -- started bringing that together with the capabilities that TransUnion already had, but also the communications business as well. Those are two businesses that should perform relatively okay in a down environment, and that also should be a contributing factor to the growth rate for the year.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. That's a good add. So, my commentary was focused really on [technical difficulty] TransUnion and the Neustar stuff has been [technical difficulty], but those are solid growers. And as you saw in the third quarter, we had solid performance across Neustar portfolio [technical difficulty]. Next year that's going to average our performance overall.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Perfect. Thanks. Historically, Todd, you've had really a beat and raise strategy when providing guidance. And this quarter, it seemed like it's driven by a reduction in organic growth as opposed to FX and mortgage like last quarter. And I know at the beginning of the year, you talked about incorporating less conservatism into the guide. But just trying to get sort of an update on where we are now. Is this a conservative guide, a realistic guide? Is it -- there's so much uncertainty in the macro right now? So, I know you mentioned it's wider because of that. So, just wanted to get an update on that.\nTodd Cello: Sure, Toni. Be happy to. I think it's a fair question to get into. So, as I said earlier, the reduction that we took in the fourth quarter is really just a combination of what we're seeing on a daily basis with the work that our clients are giving us, but also more instructively, what our clients are telling us. And our U.S. business does a great job at working through our various advisory board. So, they hear directly from the buyers as to what they're expecting and what their sentiments are. So, we take those two factors together and that's, in essence, how the forecast comes together for us. I think that I'd say that all of our guidance has always been rooted in reality. So -- and that goes back to when we were in the beat and raise day. Just the macro has changed so significantly on us. If I were to think about two, three years ago, when we were beating and raising, we were in a very different macro environment where today, obviously, we're dealing with high inflation rising rates. We're all trying to gauge consumer sentiments and watching their savings rates and their spending patterns. So, we're trying to figure out all of that. And so, where we ended up with is the guide that we did based on all of those inputs. I'd love to tell you that it's conservative and that we got another beat and raise, but I don't have that assurance. And I think that's, again, like we said earlier, why we widened the range as well, too, which was something that we did in the third quarter, as I said earlier, that enabled us to deliver revenue in the range. And I think if you think about the third quarter, FX became a significant headwind. Something about $4 million of an impact of it. So just widening the range accounting for that. What we have all thought that the dollar would have strengthened as much as we did in the [technical difficulty], I think a lot of companies are talking about that.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. So, net-net, realistic guidance, perhaps a little additional downside sentiment in the quarter [technical difficulty] relative to the guidance, but we're dealing with the sea change in macroeconomic conditions and so less certain.\nToni Kaplan: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question on the International outlook, specifically as it relates to your considerations for 2023. Obviously, you expect another strong year. That seems to be a bit more optimistic than maybe the financial services business ex-mortgage. Can you just dive into that a little bit more? What gives you confidence in maybe the disparate growth assumptions for next year? Is it more about the economic backdrop in those regions? Is it new product development? Is it maybe some lag there in terms of how those economies are progressing relative to the U.S.? Any additional color on why it seems like International is you're going to be a bit more resilient or at least stronger next year than what you're expecting in the U.S. ex-mortgage? Thank you. \nChristopher Cartwright: Yeah. So, when we think about our International division in terms of emerging markets and developed markets as well, starting with the emerging, India, Latin America, South Africa and even across the Asia-Pacific portfolio, they are digesting -- well, first of all, the level of inflation increase is lower in those markets, and particularly India, in part because there wasn't the amount of stimulus injected into those economies, right? So, they're not suffering from higher inflation as a result of those actions. As a result, GDP growth and just vibrancy is higher there. India is fueled by all of the things I talked about; favorable demographics, great business and digitally friendly government posture. And then, we're diversifying our product lines. And so, we're enjoying rapid growth in new areas, and there's more to come. Latin America is a very similar story to India, but on a smaller scale population wise. South Africa, we've invested a lot in improving our effectiveness in that market. And I think it's starting to bear fruit. We're growing well in South Africa and very rapidly in the countries across the continent that we compete in. We've been winning new business nicely. And in Asia-Pacific, it's a similar story as well. Hong Kong is performing exceptionally well. The Philippines are back. There's also some element in our emerging markets of the rebound from the COVID chapter, right? And these economies, these countries emerged a little later from the pandemic than in the U.S. But overall, I just think it's a more favorable mix of growth drivers. Now in Canada and the U.K., in both of these markets, underlying is high single digit organic growth. It's tempered somewhat in each market. Canada had some one-time revenue that it had to lap. But in Canada, we continue to win new customers and that's positioning us well for next year. And in the U.K., the growth -- the headline growth number is lowered by the very large contract we had with the government over the year in that contract. But as the pandemic has eased, so the revenues associated with that contract. So, next year, we would expect, given all of this, continued strong growth in International. That's an important element of [technical difficulty] recently material TransUnion overall.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And we will wrap it up there. I think it's a great question to end on, actually. A very exciting story in International. I know it's a very busy earnings day as we're in the midst of the earnings season. So, we're going to give you guys a little bit of time as well as a little bit of time here. Thank you all for joining us today and we hope you have [technical difficulty]. Thank you\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christopher Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. I'll first discuss the economic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world and then provide an overview of our solid in range financial results for the third quarter. I'll also review the encouraging performance of our recent acquisitions and the strong progress we've made to deliver our targeted savings, revenue acceleration, and sharing of their market leading technologies across the enterprise. Todd will then take the reins and review in detail our third quarter results and our full year guidance. Thus far in 2022, consumer financial health has remained positive versus pre-pandemic conditions supporting growth across TransUnion, especially in our emerging markets. Consumer employment, income, spending, balance sheets and credit performance have been strong year-to-day. However, the dramatic increase in inflation globally, especially in our developed markets of the U.S., the U.K. and Canada, have begun to pressure household finances leading to a reduction in savings rates, increasing credit balances, and modestly higher credit delinquencies. As a result, businesses have adopted a more cautious outlook given rising market uncertainties. In the U.S., the U.K. and Canada year-to-date, soaring inflation and higher interest rates have primarily impacted below prime consumers. Emerging markets such as India and South Africa have digested higher inflation and other challenges and still delivered strong growth. We expect this positive performance to continue in the foreseeable future. In the U.S., higher inflation and interest rates have negatively impacted several of our businesses. Increased borrowing costs due to higher rates has decimated mortgage refinanced volumes and slowed new purchases due to an imbalance between historically high home prices and dramatically decreased affordability. And as we discussed last quarter, a shortage of multifamily housing along with higher home ownership costs has caused rental rates to skyrocket and move volumes to decline precipitously negatively impacting our tenant screening business. And although performance in our credit card and consumer lending verticals remain strong, lenders have reduced new customer acquisition in response to growing pressure on household finances and prioritize customer retention and portfolio risk assessment. Growth in the auto market also remains positive, albeit constrained by the well publicized supply chain challenges. And our large bank customers during their recent earnings calls indicated that while the U.S. consumer remains strong, they are preparing their balance sheets for the material economic headwinds they anticipate in 2023. Higher inflation has similarly dampened marketing activity in the insurance industry with carriers prioritizing rate increases over customer acquisition due to rising repair and replacement costs. Given the complexity insurers face obtaining rate increase approvals for the policies they offer in each state in which they operate, it will take some time before they secure the necessary price increases to resume their full marketing activity. We believe that carriers will succeed in obtaining higher coverage rates, and that once they do our insurance vertical will return to its typical high single digit to low double-digit growth rate as carriers resume marketing and consumer shop for the best coverage and price. And finally, activity remained brisk for our marketing services products in the quarter. Although, we anticipate that as economic uncertainty grows, brand owners, media companies and ad agencies will reduce volumes in certain end markets with the greatest risk coming in 2023. And now turning to our third quarter performance. We posted solid results within our guidance range despite increasingly difficult conditions due to the economic pressures I previously discussed. Our strength in the quarter came from several verticals in the U.S. and our International segment overall. U.S. financial services grew 9%, excluding mortgage on top of healthy 31% growth in the year ago quarter. Our media vertical grew double-digits and insurance also posted mid single digit growth, despite the carrier marketing slowdown. And International grew by 16% on a constant currency basis, with five of our six regions growing double-digits led by 39% growth in India, 24% growth in Asia-Pacific, and 18% growth in Africa. We also delivered adjusted EBITDA margins at the high end of our range, reflecting our high flow through margins, cost savings from the Neustar acquisition and prudent expense management overall. And as I will discuss in a moment, our acquisitions performed ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we continue to build revenue momentum and achieve our cost synergies. Given the increasingly challenging market conditions, we have reduced our fourth quarter and full year guidance to reflect the impact of higher inflation across the markets we serve. We've also broadened our guidance range, given the economic uncertainties. First, FX headwinds worsened in the quarter and we now estimate an incremental $12 million reduction in the fourth quarter as a result. We expect the unusually strong U.S. dollar to persist throughout 2023 and temper the impact of the strong performance of our International segment. Second, for the fourth quarter, we reduced U.S. mortgage revenues by a further $7 million, still within our prior range of 30% to 35% down, but now trending to the lower end of the range. Third, we reduced revenue expectations across the non-mortgage U.S. markets portfolio by $33 million across the base of approximately $2.1 billion due to softening market conditions. And finally, I want to emphasize that we did not reduce our outlook for International, given the strong performance year-to-date and continuing positive conditions in our emerging markets. We continue to monitor our performance closely in our 30-plus non-U.S. markets and our management teams continue to perform well despite higher inflation and interest rates, and even rolling electrical blackouts in South Africa. We also maintain our estimates in consumer interactive as it remains on track to achieve the targets we outline in the last quarter. But now turning to our three acquisitions. We've made substantial progress integrating them into TransUnion this year. Each acquisition is on track against our business cases and the expectations we set on prior calls. Importantly, we believe our results thus far and the market feedback we've received proves the rationales for the deals and the power of combining them in a TransUnion. Starting with Neustar, revenue grew mid single digits in the corner, in line with our full year expectations across marketing, fraud and communications. In our increasingly integrated TransUnion and Neustar marketing solutions grew high single digits year-to-date. As we continue to execute against our growth pipeline, we announced meaningful new marketing sales during the quarter to iHeartRADIO, Stirista, and InfoSum, as well as a partnership with Snowflake. Despite industry caution about future advertising levels, we see strong interest in the full family of Neustar marketing solutions, which provide benefits throughout market cycles. In a tighter advertising environment, marketers seek to optimize their spending and demonstrate the impact of their campaigns with reliable quantitative measures. With the decline in digital identifiers, marketing platform providers also need to prove the impact of advertising within their walls. Neustar is well-positioned to provide these objective metrics on marketing -- on the marketing performance of these sites. In communications, we signed new business with LiveVox and Transaction Network Services during the quarter. We also continue to see meaningful growth from our innovative family of Trusted Call Solutions, which include branded call display, and caller name optimization. Both help businesses authoritatively identify themselves and reestablish trust in phone-based outreach to consumers, as 88% of all business calls go unanswered due to the proliferation of robo calling, scam calls and blocked or unknown numbers. Companies across a wide spectrum of markets, including financial services, insurance collections, healthcare and utilities use Trusted Call Solutions to double or even triple call pickup rates, sales and conversion rates. We have almost a thousand customers using this solution and we're added to the T-Mobile network last year in the AT&T network this year. At this stage, we estimate that we've tapped under 10% of the potential U.S. market sending us up for significant future growth. Going forward, we expect that our growth will accelerate through successful cross-selling between Neustar and TransUnion. We continue to sign new insurance collections and financial services accounts for Trusted Call Solutions and converted several material opportunities in quarter and are building our sales pipeline for next year. We also continue to successfully integrate TransUnion superior data assets into Neustar state-of-the-art data management platform, OneID, into realize cost savings and performance improvements. Our combined data assets have increased our phone coverage by 15%, email coverage by 10%, and improved the robust linking and matching capabilities across our non-credit solutions. And as part of our plan cost synergies, we expect to close seven data centers this year, reducing Neustar's physical footprint by over 90%. We've also migrated almost 90% of their products in data management services to a new lower cost public cloud provider. To wrap up, Neustar's adjusted EBITDA margins margin was about 29% in the third quarter, driven by revenue growth and our cost reduction initiatives. We expect the full year margin to also be 26%, up 500 basis points from 2021. We also have line of sight to achieving our commitment of 70 million-plus in cost savings through integrating Neustar, which we expect will provide a meaningful offset to potential margin compression during an economic slowdown or a full blown recession. Now turning to Sontiq. Revenue grew in the mid teens, with a low thirties margin in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong traction with insurance customers both domestically and abroad, with more than 40% of newly identified opportunities coming internationally. We also have a growing pipeline of opportunities in financial services. And as we mentioned last quarter in consumer interactive, we can now win business. We would not have been previously able to through TransUnion and Sontiq combined strength. This combination has resulted in an eight figure win for our indirect business that we expect to monetize in 2023. Finally, Argus revenue grew 4% in the quarter at a margin of 19%. For the full year, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits, with the 20% margin, or 34% excluding integration costs. We've already seen strong levels of customer interest, both from consortium members and non-members interested in joining and finding new ways to use the Argus data and insights, revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TransUnion's digital platforms, as well as infusing our thought leadership will be key to realizing higher sales levels. That wraps up my update on our market backdrop, third quarter performance and the integration of our three acquisitions. Now, Todd will walk you through our third quarter and full year 2022 guidance. Todd? Thanks Todd. So to conclude, TransUnion delivered another good quarter of growth at an attractive margin. We also continue to make meaningful progress integrating our recent acquisitions and clear top and bottom line benefits are emerging. We have appropriately recalibrated our guidance to reflect current market conditions. And while the broader environment remains uncertain, TransUnion continues to execute at a high level, giving us confidence that we can whether whatever economic uncertainty lies ahead, even as we continue to make growth oriented investments. And before I conclude my remarks, I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge yesterday's announcement by the Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Sandra Thompson, concerning evolutions in the mortgage underwriting space. We were pleased by Director Thompson's announcement to share the FHFA's perspective that safety and soundness and expanding home ownership are the twin objectives for any reform efforts. We're optimistic that the requirement of VantageScore 4.0 score use by mortgage lenders will responsibly and sustainably expand credit access for consumers and also in time increase competition and innovation in the space. We're also equally focused on the announcement that the FHFA and the GSEs will launch a multiyear program to adopt requirements that lenders use two, rather than three credit reports for mortgage originations. We anticipate that we will play a leading role engaging with the stakeholders across the mortgage industry in the coming years, especially the FHFA as we work on appropriate implementation timelines and details. And so taking together the adoption of VantageScore 4.0, and then the migration over time from a tri-merge to a bi-merge requirement will reshape the mortgage landscape and present new opportunities for TU to sell both existing solutions, but also encourage the development of new and novel customer data products. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Aaron. Yeah. So, I would just add one small thing to that, which is you did -- you started by saying it's a more difficult environment to forecast, and we agree with that. And Todd take you through the mechanics of how we've tried to be prudent in our fourth quarter guidance and anticipate some of those trends. In circumstances like these, it's easy to focus on the negatives, the deceleration against prior year performance. Prior year performance, that was absolutely very high, by the way, we're reinforcing. But there are also some positives as you look forward into next year. One, mortgage will be less of a drag, if a drag at all, to be determined than it was -- this year, International will continue to be strong. We expect a material improvement in the performance of our direct consumer business. We think the tenant screening market will become unstuck. So, there are a variety of positives that will happen as the market works toward an equilibrium. And again, as I said, we're laser focused on what's going on in the market. We're going to use -- the fourth quarter will be instructional, and then we'll provide our guidance in the early part of next year and a more robust discussion around what we're anticipating. Yeah. Well, look, it's kind of early days based on the announcement that we just received yesterday. I think the win for consumers and the win for the mortgage industry and the economy is that we'll now be using a score that we know scores more consumers in the U.S. and scores them more accurately. So, it is a win for financial inclusion and mortgage origination generally. We also like the emphasis on safety and soundness by the FHFA and the GSEs. The two factors that go into that is one scoring accuracy, which I feel like they've addressed by requiring the VantageScore, but also just the volume and breadth of information. Now, they've indicated that they're going to suggest or recommend a change in the mortgage credit report market. I think we need time to better understand what exactly that means. The agency hasn't released its details nor an implementation plan. In an environment where there is more competition, be it around score or credit, we do have a great trended credit product. We are an industry neutral player and we've got a wide range of data. And I think this will, net-net, just set off a period of innovation that could be quite helpful to the space and the consumers and the bureaus alike. But I think it's a little early now given some of these uncertainties and unknowns to kind of declare what the future is going to look like. Yeah. Well, look, I -- we just got back from an extended trip in India where we spend time not only in Mumbai with our leading credit franchise, but also in Chennai and other parts where we've got a lot of our employees, our development talent and BPO as well. As always, it's a very invigorating experience to spend time in India, particularly with our business. India is very much emerging on the global stage economically, for sure and even politically. And you sense a tremendous optimism when you're over there. We have certainly benefited from the underlying -- the positive growth drivers in that market. Hundreds of millions of Indian citizens have entered the middle class. There's an equal tranches along the way. The government there is committed to aggressive economic growth by taking advantage of kind of the era of intellectual product and India's very kind of progressive approach to digitizing their economy. So, we're benefiting from market trends. We also think we have reinforced or gained share along the way. And we're also diversifying our product line. I mean we, of course, are bringing in the full complement of products around consumer credit and analytics, and we expect considerable growth through the broadening of the product line there. We're making a similar play in commercial where we've really improved the competitiveness of our commercial credit bureau. And we continue to innovate. We've launched a score that will help commercial lenders evaluate small to medium businesses, a very fast growing and dynamic segment of the Indian economy and also a suite of products for agricultural lending, which, again, is an underpenetrated part of the Indian market. So, the combination of natural market growth plus broadening our product line across segments and adjacencies, I think, really positions us for strong growth for years ahead in India. Sure. Well, our financial services businesses breaks down into the four subsegments: cards, consumer loans, auto and of course, mortgage. Mortgage is far and away the most volatile component of that. Mortgage was a great counterbalance during the downturn related to COVID, and it more than doubled in a couple of years because of the lower interest rates. Now the rates have reversed themselves. It's being halved again. So that's where the real volatility is. Auto's growth currently is constrained. Demand far exceeds supply currently. We would expect supply conditions to improve over time. And so, we're expecting relative stability on the auto side. And look, credit cards and consumer loans, while the growth rate has declined, it's still growing nicely. And card originations are healthy. Although, card marketing activity has tapered somewhat. The same is true on consumer loans. And the FinTechs remains strong and fast growing and we expect them to grow throughout the cycle, because they are disrupting the space. They are in aggressive growth mode. They continue to market. They continue to have secure funding sources. And so, while I think we're entering a period of likely slower growth at least until we find an equilibrium with inflation and interest rates, we do expect the space, financial services that is to remain a positive grower. Well, let me handle Neustar. And then, Todd, the question was -- there is a slowdown scenario and then perhaps a scenario of deep recession, if you will. And we're not making a guess as to which one it is at this point, but Manav is trying to understand how far credit card can drop in a recession scenario and just given your experience, helping to manage the business through 2008. Any perspective you want to share? Yeah. And just on the card side, Manav, I would say that while we're definitely in a slowdown period. We are selling very effectively. 2021 was a record level of sales for us, and we're poised to exceed it materially in 2022 on the financial services side. So, what we're doing in the market is resonating and putting new customers and the like and expanding share within customers is somewhat of an offset as now to the downturn. You also asked about Neustar. I break that down [technical difficulty]. If you look back to the pandemic year of 2020, Neustar win by 1% across its three lines of business. Marketing was flat. And remember the second quarter was quite a shock to the system, and then we had a slow rebound in the third quarter, and we started to approach something like normalcy in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's a good test case for how the business would perform if it's really, really, really bad as it was in 2020. The other thing I'd just mention is that Neustar marketing solutions have value across the business cycle. The vast majority of it is subscription versus subscription like. And the components are cleansing data hygiene so that you're only mailing one-time or are gaining digitally one-time for a consumer, right? So you eliminate waste, extremely important in a downturn, as is the media mix that you're planning and the measurement of the effectiveness of your marketing efforts, if anything, those things become more important in a more constrained environment, right? Now 20% of the marketing portfolio is more volume influenced. That's the audience generation and utilization. We're already -- we've already seen that a bit on the Neustar side, and we've talked about that over the course of the year. On the TransUnion side of the house where we have -- also have similar data, but some unique things. We're growing pretty rapidly. And if you look at marketing together, and increasingly, we have to as we integrate, the marketing part of TransUnion is growing double-digits, right? So, that is encouraging. Anyway -- so that's what I can offer you on those two topics. Yeah. Heather, I'll start off and I'll focus on the first part of your question, because the timing of these things that may be a degree of precision that's just tough at this point. But look, the largest component of emerging verticals is the insurance business. And it grew mid single digits. That's off of a comp from a year ago period of 20% growth, right? And the main reason why it slowed from its typical high single, low double-digit pace is because of inflation impacting or increasing the cost of repairing and replacing damages, right? So, claims expenses on policies are up, and carriers need to charge more for those policies. But the mechanisms by which they can raise prices are complicated in the U.S. Insurance is a regulated product in all 50 jurisdictions, product-by-product. So, they are currently implementing the rate increase filings across their competitive landscape. It will take some time for those increases to be ratified. And once they are, they will resume new policy origination full force. And so, we expect that to recover. And we have seen this period in the insurance kind of business cycle multiple times before. The other unusual element is the degree of slowdown around tenant screening. And frankly, there's just -- there's kind of a boycott in the market. And you are starting to read about it in the mainstream press. Price increases on apartment rentals in the multifamily space, in particular, have been really considerable and compounding, and now tenants are just not able to or not willing to move. And whenever there's a supply/demand imbalance, it takes a little bit of time to work it out where we start transacting again. I'm confident we are going to find that equilibrium. We are going to start transacting again. And the one bright spot in new home construction, if you will, is multifamily rental units. It will take some time for that supply to come online, but that's going to be helpful in the intermediate term to increasing the transactional volume. Public sector is truly an anomaly. We had some big one-time work in the third quarter of last year, and we also had a new sale that pushed to the fourth quarter. And those two things led to a down quarter. We don't expect a down quarter in the fourth quarter and we expect this area to continue to grow nicely for us. In communications, look, we had two major communications clients. They're big fraud client users merge. And as they digested the merger, they've recalibrated their need for the product at a lower level. We maintain the exclusive supply relationship, but we've had to reduce our transaction volume that happens with M&A. The good news is they're still our client, but their dollar volume fell a bit. The last component is collections. Collections has been a very difficult area for many years here. I'm more encouraged about our ability to grow collections, because the amount of stimulus or support being provided by the government is kind of running its course. And deferral and moratoriums and the like on debt collection or evictions are ending. And so, in 2023, I think we're turning a page and entering a more normal environment where we're going to get some growth in the collections area. So that's the various puts and takes that made, I think, Q3 anomalous in our emerging markets. And hopefully, I help you understand it better. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good add. So, my commentary was focused really on [technical difficulty] TransUnion and the Neustar stuff has been [technical difficulty], but those are solid growers. And as you saw in the third quarter, we had solid performance across Neustar portfolio [technical difficulty]. Next year that's going to average our performance overall. Yeah. So, net-net, realistic guidance, perhaps a little additional downside sentiment in the quarter [technical difficulty] relative to the guidance, but we're dealing with the sea change in macroeconomic conditions and so less certain. Yeah. So, when we think about our International division in terms of emerging markets and developed markets as well, starting with the emerging, India, Latin America, South Africa and even across the Asia-Pacific portfolio, they are digesting -- well, first of all, the level of inflation increase is lower in those markets, and particularly India, in part because there wasn't the amount of stimulus injected into those economies, right? So, they're not suffering from higher inflation as a result of those actions. As a result, GDP growth and just vibrancy is higher there. India is fueled by all of the things I talked about; favorable demographics, great business and digitally friendly government posture. And then, we're diversifying our product lines. And so, we're enjoying rapid growth in new areas, and there's more to come. Latin America is a very similar story to India, but on a smaller scale population wise. South Africa, we've invested a lot in improving our effectiveness in that market. And I think it's starting to bear fruit. We're growing well in South Africa and very rapidly in the countries across the continent that we compete in. We've been winning new business nicely. And in Asia-Pacific, it's a similar story as well. Hong Kong is performing exceptionally well. The Philippines are back. There's also some element in our emerging markets of the rebound from the COVID chapter, right? And these economies, these countries emerged a little later from the pandemic than in the U.S. But overall, I just think it's a more favorable mix of growth drivers. Now in Canada and the U.K., in both of these markets, underlying is high single digit organic growth. It's tempered somewhat in each market. Canada had some one-time revenue that it had to lap. But in Canada, we continue to win new customers and that's positioning us well for next year. And in the U.K., the growth -- the headline growth number is lowered by the very large contract we had with the government over the year in that contract. But as the pandemic has eased, so the revenues associated with that contract. So, next year, we would expect, given all of this, continued strong growth in International. That's an important element of [technical difficulty] recently material TransUnion overall."

            "content": "Thanks Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 26% on a reported and 29% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 27 points to revenue and organic constant currency growth was 1%. Our business grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2021 and 2022. On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 7.5% of our revenue, and we expect that to fall to below 7% for the full year.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 13% on a reported and 15% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, down 430 basis points compared to the year ago quarter, driven primarily by Neustar's lower margin profile. Excluding the Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus acquisitions, the margin would've been 38.6%, down about 200 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 2% driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense. Now looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. market's revenue was up 38% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic revenue declined 2%, what was up 5% excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 18% on an as reported and declined 9% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 610 basis points, but would've been down 300 basis points, excluding the Neustar and Argus acquisitions. Diving into the results by vertical, please note that to date we have included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial services revenue grew 5% as reported and was down 4%, excluding Argus. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 9%, despite 31% growth in the third quarter of 2021, implying a 20% two-year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continues to be strong as high levels of activity persisted throughout the quarter, leading to 10% growth on top of almost 60% in the year ago quarter. While lower marketing activity reveals some softness emerging and below prime credit tiers, we are seeing FinTech lenders recalibrate their activity from customer acquisition to retention. We are also seeing incremental activity around debt consolidation, which had slowed considerably in 2020 and 2021 when consumer balance sheets reached their peak. At the same time, we continue to see growth from our strong BNPL position. Similarly, our credit card business had another good quarter, growing 9% after growth of nearly 30% in the year ago quarter. Issuers continued to fight for top of wallet position driving all channel marketing spend, as well as incremental use of alternative data in more sophisticated tools for pre-qualification and origination. While we haven't seen pullback in this activity yet, we are taking a cautious stance regarding fourth quarter activity. Our auto business delivered high single digit growth in the quarter as new business wins and on trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing helped offset lingering inventory issues for new and used vehicles. While demand remains relatively strong, we are beginning to see some softening caused by consumer affordability challenges driven by elevated vehicle prices and interest rates. To this point, the average new vehicle price in the U.S. is expected to rise to about $45,000 this year, a staggering increase of $10,000 over the past two years. For mortgage, rates have continued to rise with the average 30-year fixed rate mortgage up more than a point from the end of the second quarter and more than double what it was a year ago. This is substantially affected the total inquiry market, especially refinances. For the full year, we continue to expect the inquiry market to be down 40% to 45% and our revenue to fall 30% to 35%. We designed our late July outlook to be conservative and to anticipate further headwinds, including higher rates and inflation without much if any reduction in home prices. Backdrop has largely played out as we expected, and therefore we are not altering our full year outlook. As a reminder, we expect our business to perform better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases. Increased demand for targeted marketing solutions as the market tightens and increased interest in home equity lending products like HELOCs as a result of substantial home equity increases. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 91% on a reported basis and 1% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. Insurance delivered another good quarter with mid single digit growth, despite the slowdown in marketing, Chris described and building on a very strong year ago quarter when revenue was up more than 20%. We continue to see strength from our innovative solutions in commercial and life applications, as well as DriverRisk in our traditional private auto market. As Chris mentioned, in addition to these organic opportunities, our recent acquisitions are driving significant incremental growth opportunities. Our public sector vertical decline in the quarter due to the timing of several deals. We remain confident that this business will return the growth in the fourth quarter. Tenant and employment screening grew slightly as a result continued softness in the tenant market driven by fewer renters moving as inventory levels have tightened and rental rates have risen sharply. Employment screening, a smaller portion of this vertical continues to deliver attractive growth. Though, we've seen signs of softness as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring. Our media vertical grew double-digits again in the quarter, and we continue to sign or expand contracts with leading social platforms and media companies that serve a broad range of categories. Consumer interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, increased 9% on a reported basis and declined 9% organically due to decreases in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5%, but down 6% excluding Sontiq. Similar to the second quarter, moderating consumer demand for paid credit related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels and challenging multiyear comparisons to exceptionally strong performance in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021, adversely impacted revenue. This is largely a result of a marketplace shift towards freemium offerings for credit monitoring. Partially offsetting this is continued strength in identity protection, an area where our Sontiq acquisition enhances our capabilities. On the indirect side, the restructuring of one of our key partnerships last year and some non-recurring breach revenue have created an unfavorable year-over-year comparison. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 16% with five of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA for International increased 18% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 4%. Excluding the revenue related to the one time contracts including with the U.K. government, we would've grown about 9% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. Notably, higher inflation and political transition have weighed on customer activity and confidence. However, offsetting these forces, we are seeing an acceleration in TrueVision, our trended credit offering in the U.K., along with strength in direct to consumer as three of the four largest lenders now use our CreditView platform, and we're also seeing increased traction in our insurance vertical. Our Canadian business grew 10% in the third quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. While we see macro indicators softening a bit, our core business in the third quarter remains strong as we continue to garner new business ranging from large banks to one of the largest BNPL players. We expect these moves, once fully executed in 2023, will position us as the leader in the Canadian financial service market and the BNPL sector. Also driving growth, we continue to benefit from customers ordering incremental batch, data and analytics to recalibrate their post-COVID models in order to be recession ready. In India, we grew 39% reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation, and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. As a result, we benefit from a third consumer lending and credit card issuance, along with the continued rise of FinTech and BNPL players, all markets where we hold very strong share positions. In Latin America, revenue was up 13% with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in many of our key markets. This strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, ongoing new business wins, shared shifts in financial services, particularly with FinTechs and neobanks and continued uptake of CreditVision, and fraud solutions.  In Asia-Pacific, we grew 24% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by CreditVision's growth, and new business with FinTech players. We expect revenue from the Philippines to double for the full year and to exceed pre-COVID levels as the economy has now fully reemerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory. Finally, Africa increased 18% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region, despite a challenging environment that includes rolling electrical blackouts in consecutive quarters of contracting real GDP in our largest market, South Africa. Notably, we won meaningful new business and secured important contract renewals in South Africa. Outside of South Africa, we have spent years establishing valuable footholds in emerging countries like Kenya and Zambia. We are now seeing the fruits of these investments with meaningful growth in these countries, particularly with micro and FinTech lenders further validating our global IP strategy. Now shifting to leverage and liquidity. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.9 billion of debt, $596 million of cash on the balance sheet, and pro forma leverage of 3.9 times. We expect to delever to 3.8 times by the end of 2022. We also intend to use a portion of our cash to prepaid debt in the fourth quarter. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. All of the guidance provided reflects Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus. Starting with the fourth quarter, we expect about three points of headwind from FX on revenue and four points of headwind from FX unadjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate about a 19 point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq, and Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $896 million and $916 million, or a 13% to 16% increase on an as reported basis and flat to down 3% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes an approximate four point headwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will grow 2% to 4% on an organic constant currency basis.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $318 million and $333 million, an increase of 13% to 18%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to fall in a range of down 30 to up 50 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and Argus relatively lower margins. On an organic basis, excluding the three acquisitions, we anticipate our margins to increase by more than 150 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.80 and $0.86, a range of down 2% to up 6% negatively impacted by the effect of rising rates and approximately 30% of our debt that is floating. For the full year, we expect FX to impact revenue by about two points. Based on this recent dollar strengthening at current rates, we expect FX to have a negative impact on revenues for the next several quarters. We also anticipate about 24 points of benefit from M&A. We expect revenue to be between $3.704 billion to $3.724 billion up 25% to 26%. Our guidance includes approximately four points headwind for mortgage for the full year. So excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis, we anticipate revenue will increase about 7%. For our business segments on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to grow low single digits, but up high single digits excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be down low single digits, but up low double-digits excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up mid single digits. We anticipate that International will grow in the mid teams on constant currency terms, and we expect consumer interactive to decline in the high single digits on an organic basis. Both International and consumer interactive are on change from our previous guidance. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.343 billion and $1.358 billion up 16% to 17%. We expect a two point headwind from foreign exchange. Additionally, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 280 to 260 basis points this year, driven by the lower margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq and Argus. Anticipate the margin will decline about 25 basis points on an organic basis. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $3.63 and $3.69, up 6% to 7%. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022 at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22%, slightly lower than our previous guidance. Depreciation and amortization will still be approximately $520 million, and we still expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $210 million. Continue to anticipate net interest expense will be about $225 million for the full year. This implies our interest expense to be roughly $65 million in the fourth quarter. And as you think about interest expense modeling, roughly 68% of our debt is currently swapped from floating to fixed. We have 1.4 billion notional swaps that are expiring at the end of the year, which fixed the variable rates on that notion at 2.7%. We expect to renew that swap before the end of the year, but it is likely to come at a higher swap rate given higher and rising rates. As I noted, we will continue to focus on expected debt prepayment in the coming quarters, which will effectively reduce our floating rate exposure over time. Finally, we still expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% revenue. Looking ahead the 2023 as usual, we'll provide you with guidance when we report our full year results next February. However, I think it's valuable to summarize some important considerations as we head into next year assuming these macroeconomic challenges persist. First and most important, we expect to deliver organic constant currency revenue growth at an attractive margin. To that point right now, we believe that mortgage inquiry volumes will decline again in 2023 with comparisons easing as we go through the year. The next two points relate back to Chris's commentary. One, the consumer in the U.S. remains relatively healthy and that bodes well for our financial services vertical, excluding mortgage. Though, we are diligently watching for any material changes. And two, some of the headwinds we're experiencing in our emerging verticals are temporal and should resolve themselves next year. We continue to expect strong performance in our International business building on an impressive 2022. And in consumer interactive, we believe that business performance will improve as we lap the contract renegotiations and some of the headwinds in direct while also benefiting from the new business wins we've discussed. As Chris also mentioned, we're seeing a very nice new business pipeline develop across all three of our acquisitions. Specific to Neustar, we have a very successful cost reduction program that is running ahead of our $70 million expectation at this point, and we expect we'll continue to deliver meaningful savings next year. And finally, my current expectation is that free cash flow will be directed to debt prepayment, helping reduce our exposure to interest rate increases. At the same time, assuming we deliver more adjusted EBITDA dollars, that will help further reduce our leverage ratio. Now pivoting to some thoughts about a more severe downturn. On our last earnings call, I spent time detailing some puts and takes relative to how our business might respond in a recession. I won't comprehensively review that story today as you can revisit the transcript at your convenience. However, I do want to reiterate the conclusion of that discussion. First, in a somewhat normal recession, we still expect our business to deliver revenue growth, and we would prioritize protecting our margins without sacrificing important investments and our commitments to integrate our recent acquisitions. This is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership and innovation. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating our recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations, and we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns the trajectory of revenue growth in order to deliver strong margin performance. I want to wrap up with a slide we showed you at our Investor Day in March of this year. Despite some of the market cyclicality we're seeing and anticipating, we still expect to deliver against these targets in 2025. Clearly, we don't expect the growth to be linear, but our attractive end markets and geographic footprint, differentiated in complimentary solution offerings and innovation pipeline give us line of sight to fulfilling our long-term commitment. I'll turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Hey, good morning Andrew, and thanks for the question. This is Todd. I'll take that. As far as slide 17 is concerned, really what we're trying to get across is that -- just our initial thinking as we're exiting 2022 and going into the New Year, as you can probably fully appreciate, we are not in a position at this point in time to provide guidance. Clearly, we're going to see how the macro environment plays out for the rest of the year and even into the New Year before we provide any guidance. So, as far as, to your question about, are we going to guide us? Are we talking about a specific percentage, a 7% to 8%? We didn't put that on the slide because, we're not certain right now as far as how things are going to play out. But what we felt was important was to give the market and our investors a perspective on just what it is that we're feeling right now. And based on the current trajectory that we are experiencing in the economy, we feel that we are going to deliver organic growth. That growth rate still to be determined, could potentially be in line with our long-term growth rate, but we don't know yet. As I'm sure many companies don't, and we provide the color just to give a directional sense as to what we're seeing. So, just to kind of go through that again, in mortgage we're expecting that to continue to decline next year. We just see no inflation pressures continuing to be very elevated. And as a result of that interest rates will respond accordingly. As it pertains to the rest of the U.S., our financial services business, I say arguably, in the third quarter still had a strong performance. The growth rates were still very good. They were lower than, clearly what we had outlined, but nevertheless, still strong performance and especially when you compare that to the growth rates that we lapped last year I think it was pretty strong quarter there. But we're cautiously watching the U.S. consumer to see -- how they, how they react to this. I'd say the emerging verticals, the growth rate that we experienced in the quarter being at about 1%. There's a lot of kind of -- as we say on the slide, idiosyncratic issues that are impacting that. And we fully expect that to normalize when we get into 2023. And I would just say that our International business continues to be very -- continues to be very strong, and resilient at this point. But again, we're watching more of the developed markets like Canada and the U.K. And then finally, I think the big positive and Chris highlighted this in his comments is that the acquisitions perform very well for us in the third quarter. Neustar was on our revenue expectations and the integration is well on track. And we've been able to secure the cost synergies that we committed to a year ago when we announced the deal, we're getting there. We're confident to achieve at least the $70 million that we communicated. Sontiq strong quarter, integration going well, and Argus as well. The business has rebounded nicely. So, we feel that the momentum even there on the M&A side is definitely in our favor as well. Sure. Thanks for the question on that. And I think it's more of a question pertaining to our guidance for the fourth quarter. And clearly, we have revised down from where we were at just 90 days ago roughly in our July call. And I think it's just -- it's the read from our customers and what they're telling us right now. So, just to get into a little bit of the detail. If you look at the bridge that we provided where we showed the reduction we're showing in the U.S. markets ex-mortgage that we're going to be down about $33 million. Roughly half of that is coming from financial services, including consumer lending, card and auto. But even with us taking those numbers sound like I just said in my response to Andrew's question, we're still expecting good growth rates out of those lines of business. The remainder is just more about the other verticals in our emerging verticals like tenant, tenant screening, which Chris talked about in his prepared remarks, talked about the pressures that we're seeing there, but also just maybe a little bit slowing in the media as well as in the insurance spaces, but still growing, nevertheless. So, what we've done is we've taken our outlook based on the activity we're seeing from our customers, but also just in regards to what they're telling us as well, too. And that's the reason for the reduction that we took in our guide. But things are uncertain. And we told you that when we met with you in July, and we have a wider than normal range for our guidance in the fourth quarter similar to like what we had done in the third quarter. And you can see that we delivered in range in the third quarter. So, we feel that we've captured market sentiment as well as derisked the guidance by having a wider range. Yeah. Sure. So, as far as -- I think what's important to -- when you think about TransUnion is to think about the breadth of offerings that we have for our customers. So, where credit card marketing could potentially slowdown in a recessionary environment, and that clearly would have an impact on our prescreen marketing jobs that we produce. We do have a whole host of services on a portfolio review basis, meaning how do we help our clients manage their existing book of business. And we find that incredibly beneficial during a downturn, maybe not completely countercyclical, but it definitely is an offsetting element of it, because our customers, first, they'll look at their existing book just to understand the risk that they potentially have, but they'll also look at it -- and how to manage lines of credit, but they'll also look at it as a way to cross-sell. So, if they have a certain subset of their portfolio that's performing well, they'll look for opportunities within their own portfolio to broaden their services. The most recent example of that is in the early days of the pandemic. All of our customers shifted like almost overnight from an acquisition perspective to more of a portfolio review. And our sales team was extremely proactive in bringing those offerings to the market. And that's an important point. I know you're asking about credit cards, but I want to go back to the question just in regards to the consumer lending and the FinTech space. Chris already said, we are continuing to see very healthy amounts of marketing for the same reason that I just talked about and learnt. Now don't forget that TransUnion has relationships with 24 of the top 25 FinTechs, and we have deep partnerships with them. So, when they're marketing -- if it does slowdown, we have that same set of portfolio of products that we're going to offer to them. So -- and the relationships that we have with these clients are outstanding. So, we fully believe that we'll be able to help them better manage their business in any [indiscernible]. And Chris, I would just add on to it. [Technical difficulty] year in 2023, our Neustar business will be considered organic. At that point in time and for the reasons Chris gave pertaining to marketing, I think it's also important to highlight the risk in the fraud business that we have now in conjunction with -- started bringing that together with the capabilities that TransUnion already had, but also the communications business as well. Those are two businesses that should perform relatively okay in a down environment, and that also should be a contributing factor to the growth rate for the year. Sure, Toni. Be happy to. I think it's a fair question to get into. So, as I said earlier, the reduction that we took in the fourth quarter is really just a combination of what we're seeing on a daily basis with the work that our clients are giving us, but also more instructively, what our clients are telling us. And our U.S. business does a great job at working through our various advisory board. So, they hear directly from the buyers as to what they're expecting and what their sentiments are. So, we take those two factors together and that's, in essence, how the forecast comes together for us. I think that I'd say that all of our guidance has always been rooted in reality. So -- and that goes back to when we were in the beat and raise day. Just the macro has changed so significantly on us. If I were to think about two, three years ago, when we were beating and raising, we were in a very different macro environment where today, obviously, we're dealing with high inflation rising rates. We're all trying to gauge consumer sentiments and watching their savings rates and their spending patterns. So, we're trying to figure out all of that. And so, where we ended up with is the guide that we did based on all of those inputs. I'd love to tell you that it's conservative and that we got another beat and raise, but I don't have that assurance. And I think that's, again, like we said earlier, why we widened the range as well, too, which was something that we did in the third quarter, as I said earlier, that enabled us to deliver revenue in the range. And I think if you think about the third quarter, FX became a significant headwind. Something about $4 million of an impact of it. So just widening the range accounting for that. What we have all thought that the dollar would have strengthened as much as we did in the [technical difficulty], I think a lot of companies are talking about that."

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations Web site this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our Web site. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me now turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. I'll begin with an overview of our financial results along with commentary on the economic conditions in our markets around the globe. I also would like to share highlights on the performance of our acquisitions and the progress we've made to integrate them and realize their full potential. Todd will then review in detail our second quarter results, our revised full year guidance and the changes to our business over recent years that should improve its performance during economic downturns.  Now throughout the first half of this year, economic conditions have been positive across our portfolio. Consumer employment, incomes, balance sheets, spending, savings rates and credit performance have been strong in most of the markets that we serve globally. We expect this favorable environment to continue over the balance of the year. That said, there are macroeconomic concerns emerging globally that could pressure consumer spending and growth over the intermediate term.  Materially higher interest rates and inflation worsened by supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainties could negatively affect economic conditions in 2023. These factors are more visible today in our developed markets such as the U.S., Canada and the UK. We will continue to watch the economic factors and overall consumer health across our global portfolio and react appropriately to changing conditions.  Now we also believe that we're well positioned to withstand an economic downturn due to our increased diversification across geographies, vertical markets, and solutions. Demand should remain strong during the slowdown across our emerging markets, where economic growth is inherently higher and credit utilization is expanding in the developing middle classes.  Also, verticals such as insurance, telecom, collections, and professional services, legal and law enforcement in the public sector run either neutral to or counter to economic cycles. And many of our solutions should perform well during slowdowns, including credit portfolio management, fraud mitigation, investigative solutions, performance analytics, and others. Todd will supply further perspective on our portfolio resiliency later in this call.  Now as you can see from our earnings release, we posted strong results for the second quarter and reissued solid guidance for the full year based on the strength of our core business and the positive contributions of our recent acquisitions. In the second quarter, TransUnion's organic constant currency revenue growth was 5% overall and 9% excluding U.S. mortgage revenues.  U.S. markets grew 13%, excluding mortgage. International grew 15% and consumer interactive declined 9% due to a series of market and TransUnion specific challenges, which I will discuss below. All results again are on an organic constant currency basis. In the U.S. markets in the second quarter, financial services, excluding mortgage, grew a robust 18% on the strength of consumer lending, which grew 29%, card and banking which grew 17% and auto, which managed to grow 5% despite inventory shortages.  Also, our insurance, media and public sector verticals grew by double digits organically. Our international segment grew 15% on an organic constant currency basis behind surging growth in our emerging markets of India, LatAm, APAC and Africa, and attractive growth in Canada and the UK after adjusting for nonrecurring revenues from the prior year. Also, sales momentum is accelerating across our international markets, as shown by increased pipelines and win rates that should propel growth throughout the second half of the year and beyond.  Now, our consumer segment declined 9% in the quarter due to a confluence of factors. The direct business declined materially in the quarter against the challenging comparisons of low double digit growth in the prior year. Also, we observed a slowdown in demand for paid credit services across the industry in the first half, especially compared to the higher growth of freemium offerings. TransUnion today has a small freemium service, and this represents an opportunity for our future growth.  Our indirect business also slowed, although not as much as direct, due to the industry-wide slowdown we observed. Indirect results also were affected by several contract restructurings last year, as we secured longer-term commitments for increased volumes. We expect to grow through this revenue compression over the course of this year. Encouragingly, sales of identity protection and breach services are exceeding expectations.  We secured multiple new material deals in the quarter, which would not have been possible prior to the acquisition of Sontiq. We have therefore shifted more of our consumer advertising spend to identity protection services given their strong performance. We expect that it will take several quarters to work through the current challenges in our consumer business related to contract restructurings and optimal product and marketing strategies.  And now turning to our revised full year guidance for 2022, we have reduced enterprise organic growth expectations, excluding U.S. mortgage, from 11% to 9.5% at the guidance midpoints. As the organic growth bridge shows, our revised guidance reflects adjustments in several factors, including the shortfall in second quarter results, a lower mortgage forecast given the rapid increase in rates and falling volumes, modestly lower growth in U.S. markets, excluding mortgage, as we reduce our forecast and financial services to the mid teens versus our earlier guide of approximately 20%.  The near-term retrenchment and consumer interactive as we adjust our marketing strategies absorb compression from restructurings and accelerate our sales of identity and breach services. And finally, foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Now overall, our revenue guidance for 2022 is still very compelling on the strength of rebounding economic activity from pandemic re-openings, positive consumer financial health, TransUnion's attractive market positions and our strong execution of our growth playbook. And in addition to strong organic revenue growth, we expect to deliver on organic adjusted EBITDA margin of about 40%.  Now turning to our three acquisitions, we made substantial progress integrating them into TransUnion over the first half of this year. Each of the acquisitions is performing in line with our acquisition cases, and the expectations we communicated previously. Importantly, the feedback and results in our early days of owning these assets are proving the rationales for their acquisition and the power of combining them into TransUnion. In the quarter, Neustar revenues grew mid single digits as we expected against a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2021, where growth surged over the pandemic lockdown in 2020. We now expect revenue growth for the full year in the mid single digits based on the implementation of record sales wins from last year, which included a Fortune 10 enterprise and accelerating adoption of branded and trusted call solutions in the communications vertical. Now this is tempered somewhat by market volume uncertainty and the timing of new customer onboarding.  The business delivered 24% adjusted EBITDA margin due to the revenue fall through and ahead of target execution of our cost reduction programs. We are confident that we will migrate Neustar's technology assets to a new cloud provider with more favorable rates by the end of this year and close eight data centers as well.  Additionally, we are realizing the cost synergies that we expected through combining our general and administrative functions. Given our progress achieving our cost reduction goals, we expect to reach a 26% adjusted EBITDA margin by year end. And importantly, we will keep or accelerate our investment in areas that drive revenue growth and product innovation, which are proving to be considerable.  Now market feedback has been positive on the benefits of combining TransUnion and Neustar's credit marketing and fraud prevention capabilities. Therefore, we have accelerated the integration of our marketing and fraud solutions and key functions such as analytics, technology, and sales. A top priority is to incorporate TransUnion's troves of data into Neustar's OneID platform to enhance its effectiveness. The bulk of this program will be completed by the end of this year.  We also are integrating our joint audience data and functionality, including commerce signals data from Argus into a single platform and creating common identity capabilities to support TransUnion solutions enterprise wide. In this quarter, we launched an innovative marketing cleanroom that integrates client and TU data in a single compliant and privacy-enabled environment to enhance audience building, performance analytics, and collaboration generally. This cleanroom solution will be offered directly to customers and through most of the major marketing technology platform providers.  Within our newly integrated fraud business, we are executing a unified product strategy that integrates our various knowledge based device, behavioral and telephonic solutions into a common interface with a single orchestration layer on a common analytic platform. We expect a beta version of this next generation solution to be available early next year. Finally, our efforts to cross sell this expanded suite of solutions are building momentum as we experienced growing pipelines with a strong level of conversion. Across all solutions cross selling, we have more than 150 deals in various stages of our sales pipeline, including about half in the later stages. And in the first half of 2022, our increasingly integrated marketing solutions grew double digits.  Now turning to Sontiq, it generated almost 24 million in revenue in the second quarter, down slightly versus expectations as it compared to our quarter last year with revenues from a large breach. We have fully integrated the sale of credit access and monitoring with identity protection and breach remediation, and build a robust pipeline with significant new sales, including a major competitive takeaway that would not have been possible without Sontiq solutions. We expect that our increased level of new sales will result in accelerated growth starting in 2023.  Overall, Sontiq's revenues for the full year are trending slightly ahead of plan and our cost integration efforts are continuing to pace. We expect mid teens revenue growth this year and almost a 40% margin, excluding integration costs. And I'll conclude my deal updates with the acquisition of the businesses that were previously part of the Verisk Financial Services group.  As a reminder, there are six businesses in this portfolio and we've decided to keep Argus insights and Commerce Signals and to divest the remaining companies due to a lack of strategic fit with TransUnion. The retained businesses generated revenue of about 95 million in 2021. We have moved the other companies to discontinued operations and are currently marketing them to prospective buyers. Thus far, we have received robust interest and we'll keep you apprised as the sale process develops. Now in the quarter, we realized revenue from Argus and Commerce Signals of 22 million, up 4% and at a margin of 20% or 25%, excluding the integration costs. We've already seen strong levels of customer interest in finding new ways to use the Argus data and insights, which have led to many requests for joint discovery engagements. As we integrate Argus over the year, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits with a 31% margin, excluding integration costs.  Next year, our plan is for growth to increase to the high single digits and then reach low double digits in 2024 with the margin expanding in these years, as we trend toward our enterprise goal of a 40% margin in 2026. Now revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TransUnion's digital platforms as well as using our thought leadership will be key to realizing these higher sales levels.  And before I turn the time over to Todd, I want to take a moment to welcome two new Board members to TransUnion, Hamidou Dia and Ravi Kumar. Hamidou is the Vice President and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at Google Cloud, where he leads the global solution engineering organization. His expertise in both cloud architecture and digital transformation will guide us as we continue to build out our state-of-the-art technology infrastructure.  Ravi is the President of Infosys, a global IT consulting and services company, where he leads the Infosys Global Services Organization across all industry segments. He brings extensive experience in reimagining and reinventing technology services that will help shape the solutions and products we develop. That wraps my update on our market backdrop, second quarter performance and the integration of our recent acquisitions.  I'll now turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our second quarter financial results and our third quarter and full year guidance. So, Todd, over to you. \nTodd Cello: Okay. Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 30% on a reported and 32% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 27 points to revenue and organic constant currency growth was 5%.  Our business grew 9% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2021 and 2022. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 9% of our revenue and we expect that to fall below 7% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.9%, down 360 basis points compared to the year ago quarter driven primarily by the lower margin profile from Neustar. Excluding the Neustar, Sontiq and Argus actions, the margin would have been 40.2%, down about 30 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 11%, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense.  Now looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 44% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic growth was 5% or 13% excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 25% on an as reported and 3% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 560 basis points, but would have only been down 60 basis points, excluding the Neustar and Argus acquisitions.  Diving into the results by vertical, please note that at this time we've included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. So starting with financial services, revenue grew 11% as reported and 3%, excluding Argus. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 18%.  Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continues to be very strong as historically high levels of marketing activity persisted throughout the second quarter. At this time, we don't have any indication that these lenders intend to pull back on their activity or that there is any appreciable diminishment of available investor capital. Similarly, our credit card business also had another strong quarter as issuers continued to fight for top of wallet position, driving marketing spend as well as incremental use of alternative data and more sophisticated tools for origination. Again, we have no indication this heightened activity level is slowing. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well publicized inventory issues for new and used vehicles even as consumer demand remains high. New vehicle sales expectations for 2022 recently fell by roughly 1 million vehicles. This will place additional pressure on our business in the second half of the year.  For mortgage, rates have continued to rise, substantially impacting the total inquiry market, especially refinancing. The first half of the year, inquiries declined almost 25%. For the full year, we expect the inquiry market to be down 40% to 45% and our revenue to fall 30% to 35%.  We expect our business to perform better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases, increased demand for targeted marketing solutions to help lenders attract customers as the market tightens, and increased interest in HELOC products as consumers have seen substantial increases in their home equity.  Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 98% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the revenue associated with Neustar as every vertical grew in the quarter. Insurance delivered another quarter of double digit growth on the strength of innovative solutions like DriverRisk and our traditional passenger auto market, and increasingly so in commercial and life applications. In addition to these organic opportunities, our recent acquisitions are driving significant incremental growth opportunities.  Public Sector delivered another good quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. Tenant and employment screening grew despite a softening tenant market in which fewer renters are moving and inventory levels have tightened to 98% occupancy, up from a more normal 91% level earlier this year. Employment screening remained solid. Our media vertical was up strong double digits in the quarter and we continue to sign meaningful multiyear contracts for identity resolution and other services that are embedded in our customers workflows. We won a large contract with FreeWheel, a tech arm of Comcast and a leading provider of video and sort of ad serving technologies.  We also expanded our relationship adding services via a new contract with one of the largest terrestrial radio and digital audio companies. As Chris mentioned, we are increasingly able to go to market with the combined capabilities of TransUnion and Neustar.  Consumer interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, increased 8% on a reported basis and declined 9% organically due to decreases in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5%. A few factors influenced this quarter's results. Overall, revenue was adversely impacted by moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, and challenging multiyear comparisons to exceptionally strong performance in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021. This is largely a result of a marketplace shift towards freemium offerings for credit monitoring.  Partially offsetting this is continued strength in identity protection area where the Sontiq acquisition brings enhanced capabilities. And on the indirect side, the restructuring of one of our key partnerships last year and some nonrecurring breach revenue have created an unfavorable year-over-year comparison. These factors are offsetting the benefits of a number of new and expanded contract wins. And we recently signed two new significant partnerships that we can't name yet that we expect to begin to fully monetize in 2023.  For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 15% as the underlying market improved, and most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 19% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 3%. Excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts, including with the UK government, our UK business would have grown about 8% in the quarter as our core financial services business continues to show solid mid single digit growth.  From a macro standpoint, the combination of political turmoil, the Russian conflict in Ukraine, and rising inflation and slow GDP growth is creating a uniquely challenging economic environment. That said, we continue to expect large banks to remain focused on issuing credit as rising rates improve their margins.  We also see continued activity in unsecured lending, particularly credit cards and personal loans. While we are seeing a steadily weaker mortgage market offset this activity, the impact is different than what we have experienced in the U.S. The UK mortgage market didn't reach the same historically high levels, and therefore has less room to compress. And unsurprisingly, while auto demand remains strong, supply side issues have depressed the UK market that had impacted a slightly reduced growth expectation for 2022.  Our Canadian business grew 1% in the second quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. This was partially offset by a comparison to a significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter, which I have mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the nonrecurring breach business, revenue would have grown 6%. This breach comparison moderates, starting in the third quarter. While we see macro indicators softening a bit, our core business in the second quarter remains strong for two reasons. First, we have several large customers purchasing significant amounts of data to shift or expand their business with TransUnion. We expect to monetize these new contracts in early 2023. Second, many customers are recalibrating their lending models with TransUnion data to anticipate potential further economic softness.  In India, we grew 51% reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation, the benefits of our diversified portfolio, and an easier year-over-year comparison, driven by a second wave of COVID in the year ago quarter. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. As a result, we benefit from a resurgent in consumer lending and credit card issuance along with the continued rise of fintech and BNPL players, all markets where we hold very strong share positions.  In Latin America, revenue was up 14% with broad based growth across our markets, including double digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. The strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, ongoing new business wins, share shifts in financial services, particularly with fintechs and Neo-banks and continued uptake of credit vision and fraud solutions.  In Asia Pacific, we grew 22% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by credit visions growth and new business with fintech players, along with continued recovery in the Philippines, which had been under lockdown longer than any of our other markets.  And finally, Africa increased 12% based on the strength of our insurance and retail businesses, as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market of South Africa. Across the region, we continue to see adoption of credit vision, true validate and our commercial credit solutions.  We ended the quarter with roughly $6 billion of debt, $522 million of cash on the balance sheet, and pro forma leverage of 4.0x. We continue to expect to delever the 3.7x by the end of 2022. Here I'll remind you that we expect to use proceeds from the sale of the non-core businesses we acquired from Verisk for general corporate purposes, including debt prepayments. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to quickly comment on free cash flow. You will notice on our cash flow statement that cash from operations for the six months of the year was a net use of cash. This is primarily due to the $355 million tax payment we made in April related to the gain on the sale of the healthcare business as well as higher interest expense and increased usage of net working capital, primarily related to higher incentive compensation. Also, we used $508 million of cash on hand to fund the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services.  So that brings us to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. All of the guidance provided reflects Neustar, Sontiq and the businesses we acquired from Verisk. Though for the latter, only Argus and a related business called Commerce Signals are included as we are treating the non-core businesses as discontinued and intend to divest them.  Starting with the third quarter, we expect about 2 points of headwind from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate about a 27 point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. We expect revenue to come in between 935 million and 955 million or a 26% to 28% increase on an as reported basis and a 2% to 3% increase on an organic constant currency basis.  Our revenue guidance includes an approximate 5 point headwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will grow 7% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $334 million and $348 million, an increase of 11% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 490 to 415 basis points primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and the businesses we acquired from Verisk's relatively lower margins.  On an organic basis, excluding the three acquisitions, margins are expected to decrease approximately 120 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.89 and $0.95, a range of down 3% to up 4%. The primary reason for a sequential slowdown in adjusted diluted EPS performance is the impact of rising rates on the approximately 30% of our debt that is floating.  For the full year, we expect FX to impact revenue by about 1 point. We also expect about 24 points of benefit from M&A. We expect revenue to be between $3.748 billion to $3.798 billion, up 27% to 28%. Guidance includes 5 points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis, revenue is expected to increase 9% to 10%.  For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to be mid single digits, but up low double digits, excluding mortgage. Financial services are also expected to be up low single digits but about mid teens, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up high single digits. We anticipate that international will grow low teens in constant currency terms and we expect consumer interactive to decline high single digits on an organic basis.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.362 billion and $1.399 billion, up 18% to 21%. Additionally, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 270 to 220 basis points this year, driven by the lower margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq and Argus. We anticipate the margin will expand about 20 basis points on an organic basis. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $3.70 and $3.85, up 7% to 12%.  And to help you complete your modeling of 2022, at this time, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $520 million. And we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $210 million, down from $220 million due to lower than anticipated depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions.  We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $225 million, up from $220 million due to higher LIBOR and expectations of future LIBOR increases, as implied by the forward curve. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to still come in at about 8% of revenue.  As Chris discussed, there is a level of uncertainty about market conditions for the remainder of 2022 and 2023, with many economists calling for some type of recession over the next 18 months. To help you put this in context for us, I'd like to walk you through a high level view of our business and how we would expect various parts to behave in a recession.  Before I do that, I want to lead with the conclusion. In a somewhat normal recession, we expect our total business to still deliver revenue growth. And we would place great emphasis on protecting our margins without sacrificing important investments and our commitments to integrate our recent acquisitions.  So let's start with financial services, which currently represents a much smaller portion of our much larger company than in 2008. And revenue was less than $1 billion and about 40% was tied to U.S. financial services. Today, we're just under $4 billion with only 30% tied to U.S. financial services.  Importantly, we have a more diversified product offering then in 2008, highlighted by significantly more fraud, collections, alternative data and analytic solutions. All of these are likely to be a cyclical or even countercyclical. In total, they represent more than 10% of our financial services vertical.  Additionally, even in our credit-oriented solutions, in tougher economic times, customers often shift their spending from origination-related activity to portfolio review activity. We'll talk about capabilities in this space over the last several years, further bolstered by our acquisition of Argus.  Beyond that, as we lap the massive decline in mortgage activity, a recession would likely result in lower interest rates, lower home prices, and potentially some level of rebound in both purchase and refi activity. We would also expect some level of buoyancy and consumer lending from debt consolidation and short-term lending activity, hard as consumers cope with financial challenges through additional revolving lines of credit.  Turning to international, we believe there are unique dynamics in each market that will largely behave independently from the U.S. in a moderate recessionary environment. As we're already seeing, we may face some headwinds in our developed markets while emerging markets appear to be more able and used to coping with volatile economic situations. In consumer interactive, we would expect headwinds to largely persist as consumers scrutinize their spending and as lenders reduce marketing with lead generators.  I'll close out this review with some comments on our recent acquisitions. Starting with Neustar, we expect both the communications and fraud businesses to be largely unaffected in a downturn. Marketing business is roughly 80% subscription revenue and helps customers more efficiently resolve consumer identities as well as execute and measure marketing campaigns, something that we believe will retain its value throughout the cycle. Notably, the new start marketing business only declined 1% in 2020, despite a sharp reduction in marketing spending that year. Sontiq should also hold up relatively well as 75% of their revenue is B2B2C, largely sold through benefits brokers and insurance companies. And Argus would continue to provide significant value across the cycle based on unique portfolio analytics to card issuers. So net-net, we believe that our portfolio would weather a downturn well on a relative basis and still be capable of generating revenue growth at attractive margins.  This is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations. And like we did in the second quarter of this year, we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns with the trajectory of revenue growth in order to deliver strong margin performance.  I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. To conclude, TransUnion delivered another good quarter and we're set up for a strong full year with 9% to 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding mortgage, and with an organic EBITDA margin of about 40%. And we continue to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions and to find additional confirmation of the investment thesis for each deal.  Now, let me turn the time back over to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. And that concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. Now operator, we can begin with the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. It's Andrew. I wanted to ask you a question about Slide 6, which is the current '22 guide. If you could, give us more color about the 25 million bar, which is the organic revenue growth reduction for second half of the year as it refers to U.S. markets ex-mortgage, like give us a sense, does this include an assumption about a slowing consumer lending environment or any vertical within emerging verticals that have had a kind of tempered expectation for the second half?\nTodd Cello: Hi. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I'm going to give you a response and Chris will add on. And I think it's an important one to hit off from the onset this morning. So I think what is probably most instructive to think about that $25 million ex-mortgage is just simply the growth rates that we had anticipated in our financial services business for consumer lending and for card and banking, we expected to be higher than what I would consider to be already really strong growth rates. And consumer lending, as Chris already said, we grew 29% and card and banking we were 17%. Our original guide contemplated something on consumer lending greater than 30% and for card and banking, obviously, then plus 20%. So when we set the guide in April, the signal that we were getting from the business at that point in time is that things were -- things were going to continue to be very, very strong for us in the quarter. So with that being said, that feeds off [ph] financial services. And if you go to other parts of the business, auto also is a challenge for us. I think that's pretty well documented, just due to the vehicle shortage. But nevertheless, we still were able to grow that business about 5% in the quarter. So, overall, really good. But another part of the non-financial services that I'd call out would be our tenant screening business. And in essence, what we're seeing are consumers that are staying put and they're not moving. So when that move of activity dwindles, that means less activity for TransUnion on our screening product.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And just to provide some further context, starting with the tenant screening, we still had strong growth in that vertical. It's just as interest rates increase and as home prices increase, a lot of consumers get priced out of the purchase market. They look to the rental market. That demand has led to a spike in rent prices which leads to consumers getting priced out of that. So as a result, move velocity decreases and our volume decreases. But again, I think the broader context here is really important. When we guided 20%, that reflected significant outperformance relative to the market. Now that we're guiding in the mid teens, that still reflects significant outperformance in the market. So, look, it's unfortunate that we dropped the guide a little bit in core U.S. markets, but we do feel very strong about how we're competing in the market. We continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with those clients. And again, as I said, I think we're doing very well relatively.\nAndrew Steinerman: Well said. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I'll tackle I guess the CIP. So you've previously talked about the tough comps in the direct or paid business and you've told us about the contract restructurings in the past. So I guess I'm trying to understand like what's worse, did the attrition rate pick up? Is it the attraction of new consumers? And if you could just help us understand what worsened? And then on the indirect channel, how much of that is paid or you're seeing the weakness versus other parts, including the ad supported freemium partners?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Look, I'll break it down for you, Jeff. Look, we expected some softness this year as we guided. We came in the second quarter a little bit softer. That said, going back to the basics and the dynamics, our consumer business is 40% direct, 60% indirect. On the direct side, going back for more than a year, we have been growing low teens, sometimes mid teens. What we experienced this quarter, though, and really in the first half of the year, was just diminished performance in our acquisition efforts as we look across the industry and we've got a good industry perspective, because we've got relationships with all the players, we see an industry-wide slowdown in demand for paid credit subscriptions and a strong shift to the freemium model. So that drove the reduction in the direct performance. And we're recalibrating our marketing efforts to compensate for that. We will also place a greater emphasis on our own freemium offerings. On the indirect side, again, yes, we had some contract restructurings that are going to cause revenue compression over the course of this year, but the trade off was extending the duration and winning higher volume commitments over time. So we would expect that to return to growth after we lap this year of compression. In addition to that and particularly with the addition of Sontiq now, we have had some really good new sales. We've really boosted our ability to compete for breach and identity with that addition. And we're bringing on a couple of major partners that reflect our competitiveness. And the sales pipeline and the closes have never been bigger. So the combination on the indirect side of lapping the price compression from contract restructuring and the sales pipeline and the new wins and their ramp, I think that positions us well for '23. And on the direct side, we'll have to continue to work on our marketing strategies and turn that around in subsequent quarters as well.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. In terms of I guess your customers and consumer, there's a lot of questions out there in terms of the macro and what you're seeing and Walmart reporting this morning and having a little bit more cautious view of the consumer. I'm curious if you're starting to see any signs of a downturn. Any caution on the lending side, any caution on the demand side in terms of credit, and just kind of what you're looking for, or what you would be looking for that signals a potential downturn? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure, Heather. Like all of you, we're looking at a lot of data. We're looking at overall market data in the countries in which we compete, we're looking at consumer health, and we're looking at current demand across our various lines of business. Obviously, we're concerned by rising inflation. And we know over time, it's going to sap consumer discretionary spending and it could challenge credit performance in certain categories. We have been clear, though, that we haven't seen that materialize in our financials thus far, although it's certainly present in our developed markets. We see it in the U.S., we see it particularly in the UK, and there's been a diminishment in consumer spending in the UK recently, and some of that in Canada. So clearly historic cloud's [ph] out and that's kind of where you said the economic environment is less certain in 2023. But currently, if you look at our lenders, marketing activity remains strong. The fintechs are particularly aggressive in client acquisition and they have got adequate funding to continue to originate. Card volume is really strong. And again, as we pointed out, despite the diminishment in auto supply, we still managed to grow 5%. Now, of course, we have tempered mortgage expectations. We've reduced our inquiry expectations down 40% to 45% for the year translating in revenue fall off in the low 30s. And again, we're doing our best to estimate that and we're facing an industry increase coming up. But overall, marketing and origination volumes remained strong, delinquencies remain quite modest. And so the consumer is healthy. But again, we can't ignore the impact of higher rates and inflation and what that might bring over time.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on Neustar, good momentum there and you talked about new wins as well. But one of the key concerns that we hear is all about ad spending slowing down as well as some of the challenges which are faced by the social media companies. I was wondering if you can talk about the resiliency of Neustar and the visibility that you have for Neustar to deliver mid single digit for this year, but also momentum going into 2023. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, thanks for your question, Ashish. And look, obviously, we've watched the performance of the major ad tech players and we've seen a drop in their revenue trajectories and their equity values and the like. And certainly some of that reflects diminished levels of advertising. It's hard to separate, though, from the impact that certain privacy measures like the elimination of IDFA and the diminishment of third party cookies is having on their ability to target consumers and to articulate their performance. And so that's a structural shift that's happening in their side of the business. Drawing a distinction to train Neustar and our marketing capabilities as we've explained before, we resolve identity based on a broad range of factors, of which those mobile ad IDs and identifiers are just one of a range. And we have a very high proportion of our identity resolved based on first party data relationships, which are not diminishing, right? So I feel like we're fairly well protected against that structural performance decline. Now looking at Neustar this year and in the next, I think let's start with '21 performance. '21 was a very strong year for Neustar. It grew 8% plus and it reflected both their strongest year of new sales in their history, and it was really across their several product lines, but also a surge in the volumes that reflected just the economic re-openings and a rebound in activity and marketing, and also in call center and just economic engagement broadly. So we built our projections off of that volume foundation. What we're seeing across our communications business and a bit in the marketing as well is somewhat of a diminishment of volume as we're not getting the same bounce coming out of the pandemic re-openings as we did last year, but it is being largely offset by ramping revenue from the sales success that we had last year. And that's why we're comfortable guiding in the mid single digits. And again, we're trying to be prudent here in our guidance in the early days of our ownership, as we really get to understand the factors that drive volume across these three business lines. We're also really pleased with the sales pipeline that we've developed in '22 and the close rates. And our goal for the year is to equal or exceed last year's record level of sales. And I believe that we can do it. We don't guide across pipelines, but things are looking quite solid. The second half of the year is important for us in Neustar though because we have to onboard a lot of the clients that we won last year. One of those clients, I said a top 10 Fortune enterprise, it's really one of the largest companies in the world. They bought the entire suite of Neustar marketing solutions, just reinforcing the value and the interconnection between these products. And we're spending a lot of time onboarding that, and they're going to be a major source of new revenue for us going forward. So it's just an example of kind of the intensive heads down, new win onboarding that's taking place this year that in my opinion ultimately reflects the health of the business. We're competing well. We're winning. We're gaining share. And look, the volumes are going to be -- we're going to have to see what they're going to be over the course of these first couple of years and just the uncertainties in the market going into 2023.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. This is sort of been asked in a couple of different ways so far, but I just want to make sure that I'm understanding the characterization of what's going on with the U.S. business basically. So it sounds like you're seeing still some strong lending in the market. A number of the verticals are still sort of hanging in there. But it is a little bit slower now versus previously and slower than what your initial expectations were. And it sounds like from your comments, things are still strong, but maybe just a little bit slower. And just want to understand if I'm -- confirm that I'm understanding that correctly. I think a few other companies that have reported basically said they haven't really been seeing a slowdown at this point. So just want to understand what's maybe different here versus what others have been talking about? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I think what I would say is, look, some of your characterization, I do agree with, and we have reduced our growth expectations for U.S. markets for the year. If you focus on the financial services component, we had an ambitious guide around 20%. It was founded in the trajectory of the business at the time. Now we're guiding into the mid teens range, if you will. Some of that diminishment is mortgage, which I think everybody's familiar with. And the other parts of it reflect not growing as fast as the exceptionally strong growth that we experienced -- that we projected. But Toni, what I want to be clear is if you compare the growth rates that we outlined our guide, it was materially higher than the market and our performance thus far as well as our guide for the full year reflects material outperformance. So we are really positive on the business and very positive on the guide. And at this point, we haven't seen any diminishment in lender performance or consumer strength, right? So I want to be really clear on that. The other part is the emerging markets business, which is an increasing portion we're forecasting roughly 8% growth organic over the course of the year. We have many components that are growing double digits by insurance and media and tenant and employment screening, the whole diversified markets portfolio in public sector. So while the guide is down a bit, growing low double digits is terrific. And I think you can -- if you just step back and look at this in the broad, you can only characterize our U.S. market's performance as exceptionally strong.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to talk about emerging markets. It sounds like you're expecting those countries to be pretty resilient, and just wanted more color around that. And I'm curious if it's -- are you expecting sort of the macro situation in those markets to remain resilient, or do you think that your products and if your idiosyncratic drivers in those markets that should continue to grow to the extent there is sort of disappointing macro activity?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. So, look, our international division is performing exceptionally well, mid teens organic, and within that the emerging components really, really strong growth. What I need to point out, though, is, well, first of all, overall, and certainly in the international portfolio, there is some increased challenge in forecasting results, because we have got to -- we're modeling the degree of rebound due to pandemic re-openings. In emerging markets, the shutdowns were particularly severe a year ago in India and in the Philippines and in Hong Kong. Those economies are considerably more open. It's not wide open right now, and so economic activity is returning to a more normal level. And the normal level is higher inherent economic growth than the developed markets. So GDP growth, you would expect just to be higher, and that's true even during a downturn. On top of that, you've got rising middle classes that are expanding their use of traditional credit. And so you've got the additional growth element there. So that's why we believe our emerging markets structurally will produce higher growth. Now in the quarter, India grew 51%. I would not advise you to update the CAGR for India to 51%. But it is going to remain a dramatic grower as is most of our emerging portfolio. And we look at our international business, in particular our emerging markets, and our core U.S. market's B2B business as key pillars of our outperformance.\nFaiza Alwy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weber: Hi. Thanks and good morning. I just wanted to go back to the margin performance in the quarter, which was very good, and your comment about cost management and the synergy initiatives? Is the cost management -- are you proactively reducing costs here ahead of what you see as a slowdown, or are all of those costs adjustments just related to the acquisitions? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Well, look, a good portion of it relates to the execution of our cost programs for the acquisitions. And you guys will recall that with the Neustar acquisition in particular, they were executing a pretty dramatic cost restructuring on the technology side, which consisted of changing cloud providers and also shuttering a lot of the data centers as a result. And we have been able to confirm that we can deliver all of those savings and we are well down the path toward executing that over the course of the year. The other component was the natural synergies that we would expect in general administrative expenses as we combined Neustar into TransUnion. Those are proceeding ahead of plan and that's one of the reasons why our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year are going to be at 26% on that deal. So we're very pleased about the progress and driving the EBITDA from our acquisitions and we're confident that we can deliver on that dimension. Now in the broad though, of course, we are looking at our overall spending, as most companies are doing, and we're prioritizing where we invest. However, we're remaining highly investment focused. The way to get shareholder value out of these deals and out of the transformational efforts that we've got on operations and technology and around our centers of excellence is through execution. We got to get the work done to deliver the economic benefit. And I feel like we're tracking extremely well. Now, of course, we're going to be smart on where we travel, where we entertain, where we add incremental heads, et cetera. But again, we are leaning in to acquisition integration, product innovation, and business restructuring.\nSeth Weber: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So I guess I just wanted to follow up on, it sounded like in April when you had those expectations of greater than 30% for consumer lending, 20% for card and banking, et cetera, I guess perhaps that turned out to be too optimistic. So just to get a gauge of what you're assuming for this year, could you just let us know what those revise assumptions in those two categories, and I think you call out auto and tenant as the other areas of slowdown?\nChris Cartwright: Well, Manav, we provided the detailed breakdown in Q2, because it demonstrates the strength of our performance in financial services. We've [indiscernible] an overall guide for U.S. markets for the year. We haven't broken it down though. But I think independent of the breakdown you should assume that growth is going to continue to be very strong in those categories over the course of '22. Now we're trying to be conservative in our mortgage forecast. As you can see, we are probably at the top of the market in reducing the inquiry volume that we expect in the revenue flow through. So we really tried to derisk on the mortgage side. But as you know, Manav, that's tricky business and we're facing another three quarter point increase. We'll have to see how the market reacts. But we've tried to model that and model it to the conservative side.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know it's a smaller piece of the business, but I wanted to ask another question on consumer interactive and specifically as it relates to the freemium shift. What do you think is driving that? Is it economic conditions at the lower end of the consumer market? Is it enhanced marketing from other players in that space that it sounds like you're kind of planning to catch up on or something more structural, just wondering if you have any thoughts on what's driving?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Well, I should emphasize that a big portion of our revenues from this division comes from supporting freemium players to the indirect. That's been our largest avenue of participation. And some of those agreements have been restructured to offer some, let's say, relief in the near term in exchange for duration and volume increases over time. So we're going to continue to benefit from freemium because we have kind of a supportive industry neutral relationship, if you will. And that has been a unique attribute of TransUnion for a long time. We also have our own freemium offering. It's relatively modest. And as we reformulate our marketing strategies based on our current rate of customer needs, we're probably going to increase the emphasis there. Now does this suggest some economic distress? I don't know. I wouldn't put my finger on that. I think it probably just reflects the prevalence of freemium offering, the wide availability and the need to kind of embrace that model where the basic credit report will be free, but then there's the opportunity to sell value-added services like identity protection and scores, and of course lead generation to lenders as upside.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And that's going to bring us to the end of the call this morning. We know it's an extraordinarily busy morning with Moody's, MSCI, Fiserv also all reporting among others in this space. So thank you very much for taking the time with us, and we look forward to speaking with many of you over the course of the quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 30% on a reported and 32% on a constant currency basis. Neustar, Sontiq and Argus added about 27 points to revenue and organic constant currency growth was 5%.  Our business grew 9% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2021 and 2022. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 9% of our revenue and we expect that to fall below 7% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% on a reported and 20% on a constant currency basis.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.9%, down 360 basis points compared to the year ago quarter driven primarily by the lower margin profile from Neustar. Excluding the Neustar, Sontiq and Argus actions, the margin would have been 40.2%, down about 30 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter. Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 11%, driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense.  Now looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 44% compared to the year ago quarter. Organic growth was 5% or 13% excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets increased 25% on an as reported and 3% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 560 basis points, but would have only been down 60 basis points, excluding the Neustar and Argus acquisitions.  Diving into the results by vertical, please note that at this time we've included Neustar's financial results within emerging verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. So starting with financial services, revenue grew 11% as reported and 3%, excluding Argus. Excluding mortgage, organic constant currency revenue growth was 18%.  Looking at the individual end markets, consumer lending continues to be very strong as historically high levels of marketing activity persisted throughout the second quarter. At this time, we don't have any indication that these lenders intend to pull back on their activity or that there is any appreciable diminishment of available investor capital. Similarly, our credit card business also had another strong quarter as issuers continued to fight for top of wallet position, driving marketing spend as well as incremental use of alternative data and more sophisticated tools for origination. Again, we have no indication this heightened activity level is slowing. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well publicized inventory issues for new and used vehicles even as consumer demand remains high. New vehicle sales expectations for 2022 recently fell by roughly 1 million vehicles. This will place additional pressure on our business in the second half of the year.  For mortgage, rates have continued to rise, substantially impacting the total inquiry market, especially refinancing. The first half of the year, inquiries declined almost 25%. For the full year, we expect the inquiry market to be down 40% to 45% and our revenue to fall 30% to 35%.  We expect our business to perform better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases, increased demand for targeted marketing solutions to help lenders attract customers as the market tightens, and increased interest in HELOC products as consumers have seen substantial increases in their home equity.  Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 98% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the revenue associated with Neustar as every vertical grew in the quarter. Insurance delivered another quarter of double digit growth on the strength of innovative solutions like DriverRisk and our traditional passenger auto market, and increasingly so in commercial and life applications. In addition to these organic opportunities, our recent acquisitions are driving significant incremental growth opportunities.  Public Sector delivered another good quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. Tenant and employment screening grew despite a softening tenant market in which fewer renters are moving and inventory levels have tightened to 98% occupancy, up from a more normal 91% level earlier this year. Employment screening remained solid. Our media vertical was up strong double digits in the quarter and we continue to sign meaningful multiyear contracts for identity resolution and other services that are embedded in our customers workflows. We won a large contract with FreeWheel, a tech arm of Comcast and a leading provider of video and sort of ad serving technologies.  We also expanded our relationship adding services via a new contract with one of the largest terrestrial radio and digital audio companies. As Chris mentioned, we are increasingly able to go to market with the combined capabilities of TransUnion and Neustar.  Consumer interactive revenue, which includes Sontiq, increased 8% on a reported basis and declined 9% organically due to decreases in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 5%. A few factors influenced this quarter's results. Overall, revenue was adversely impacted by moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, and challenging multiyear comparisons to exceptionally strong performance in the direct channel in both 2020 and 2021. This is largely a result of a marketplace shift towards freemium offerings for credit monitoring.  Partially offsetting this is continued strength in identity protection area where the Sontiq acquisition brings enhanced capabilities. And on the indirect side, the restructuring of one of our key partnerships last year and some nonrecurring breach revenue have created an unfavorable year-over-year comparison. These factors are offsetting the benefits of a number of new and expanded contract wins. And we recently signed two new significant partnerships that we can't name yet that we expect to begin to fully monetize in 2023.  For my comments about international, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 15% as the underlying market improved, and most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for international increased 19% as a result of our strong revenue growth. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue increased 3%. Excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts, including with the UK government, our UK business would have grown about 8% in the quarter as our core financial services business continues to show solid mid single digit growth.  From a macro standpoint, the combination of political turmoil, the Russian conflict in Ukraine, and rising inflation and slow GDP growth is creating a uniquely challenging economic environment. That said, we continue to expect large banks to remain focused on issuing credit as rising rates improve their margins.  We also see continued activity in unsecured lending, particularly credit cards and personal loans. While we are seeing a steadily weaker mortgage market offset this activity, the impact is different than what we have experienced in the U.S. The UK mortgage market didn't reach the same historically high levels, and therefore has less room to compress. And unsurprisingly, while auto demand remains strong, supply side issues have depressed the UK market that had impacted a slightly reduced growth expectation for 2022.  Our Canadian business grew 1% in the second quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio. This was partially offset by a comparison to a significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter, which I have mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the nonrecurring breach business, revenue would have grown 6%. This breach comparison moderates, starting in the third quarter. While we see macro indicators softening a bit, our core business in the second quarter remains strong for two reasons. First, we have several large customers purchasing significant amounts of data to shift or expand their business with TransUnion. We expect to monetize these new contracts in early 2023. Second, many customers are recalibrating their lending models with TransUnion data to anticipate potential further economic softness.  In India, we grew 51% reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation, the benefits of our diversified portfolio, and an easier year-over-year comparison, driven by a second wave of COVID in the year ago quarter. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. As a result, we benefit from a resurgent in consumer lending and credit card issuance along with the continued rise of fintech and BNPL players, all markets where we hold very strong share positions.  In Latin America, revenue was up 14% with broad based growth across our markets, including double digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. The strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, ongoing new business wins, share shifts in financial services, particularly with fintechs and Neo-banks and continued uptake of credit vision and fraud solutions.  In Asia Pacific, we grew 22% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by credit visions growth and new business with fintech players, along with continued recovery in the Philippines, which had been under lockdown longer than any of our other markets.  And finally, Africa increased 12% based on the strength of our insurance and retail businesses, as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market of South Africa. Across the region, we continue to see adoption of credit vision, true validate and our commercial credit solutions.  We ended the quarter with roughly $6 billion of debt, $522 million of cash on the balance sheet, and pro forma leverage of 4.0x. We continue to expect to delever the 3.7x by the end of 2022. Here I'll remind you that we expect to use proceeds from the sale of the non-core businesses we acquired from Verisk for general corporate purposes, including debt prepayments. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to quickly comment on free cash flow. You will notice on our cash flow statement that cash from operations for the six months of the year was a net use of cash. This is primarily due to the $355 million tax payment we made in April related to the gain on the sale of the healthcare business as well as higher interest expense and increased usage of net working capital, primarily related to higher incentive compensation. Also, we used $508 million of cash on hand to fund the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services.  So that brings us to our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. All of the guidance provided reflects Neustar, Sontiq and the businesses we acquired from Verisk. Though for the latter, only Argus and a related business called Commerce Signals are included as we are treating the non-core businesses as discontinued and intend to divest them.  Starting with the third quarter, we expect about 2 points of headwind from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate about a 27 point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. We expect revenue to come in between 935 million and 955 million or a 26% to 28% increase on an as reported basis and a 2% to 3% increase on an organic constant currency basis.  Our revenue guidance includes an approximate 5 point headwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will grow 7% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $334 million and $348 million, an increase of 11% to 15%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 490 to 415 basis points primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and the businesses we acquired from Verisk's relatively lower margins.  On an organic basis, excluding the three acquisitions, margins are expected to decrease approximately 120 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.89 and $0.95, a range of down 3% to up 4%. The primary reason for a sequential slowdown in adjusted diluted EPS performance is the impact of rising rates on the approximately 30% of our debt that is floating.  For the full year, we expect FX to impact revenue by about 1 point. We also expect about 24 points of benefit from M&A. We expect revenue to be between $3.748 billion to $3.798 billion, up 27% to 28%. Guidance includes 5 points of headwind for mortgage for the full year. So excluding mortgage, on an organic constant currency basis, revenue is expected to increase 9% to 10%.  For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. markets to be mid single digits, but up low double digits, excluding mortgage. Financial services are also expected to be up low single digits but about mid teens, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up high single digits. We anticipate that international will grow low teens in constant currency terms and we expect consumer interactive to decline high single digits on an organic basis.  We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.362 billion and $1.399 billion, up 18% to 21%. Additionally, we expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 270 to 220 basis points this year, driven by the lower margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq and Argus. We anticipate the margin will expand about 20 basis points on an organic basis. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year to be between $3.70 and $3.85, up 7% to 12%.  And to help you complete your modeling of 2022, at this time, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization will be approximately $520 million. And we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $210 million, down from $220 million due to lower than anticipated depreciation and amortization from recent acquisitions.  We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $225 million, up from $220 million due to higher LIBOR and expectations of future LIBOR increases, as implied by the forward curve. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to still come in at about 8% of revenue.  As Chris discussed, there is a level of uncertainty about market conditions for the remainder of 2022 and 2023, with many economists calling for some type of recession over the next 18 months. To help you put this in context for us, I'd like to walk you through a high level view of our business and how we would expect various parts to behave in a recession.  Before I do that, I want to lead with the conclusion. In a somewhat normal recession, we expect our total business to still deliver revenue growth. And we would place great emphasis on protecting our margins without sacrificing important investments and our commitments to integrate our recent acquisitions.  So let's start with financial services, which currently represents a much smaller portion of our much larger company than in 2008. And revenue was less than $1 billion and about 40% was tied to U.S. financial services. Today, we're just under $4 billion with only 30% tied to U.S. financial services.  Importantly, we have a more diversified product offering then in 2008, highlighted by significantly more fraud, collections, alternative data and analytic solutions. All of these are likely to be a cyclical or even countercyclical. In total, they represent more than 10% of our financial services vertical.  Additionally, even in our credit-oriented solutions, in tougher economic times, customers often shift their spending from origination-related activity to portfolio review activity. We'll talk about capabilities in this space over the last several years, further bolstered by our acquisition of Argus.  Beyond that, as we lap the massive decline in mortgage activity, a recession would likely result in lower interest rates, lower home prices, and potentially some level of rebound in both purchase and refi activity. We would also expect some level of buoyancy and consumer lending from debt consolidation and short-term lending activity, hard as consumers cope with financial challenges through additional revolving lines of credit.  Turning to international, we believe there are unique dynamics in each market that will largely behave independently from the U.S. in a moderate recessionary environment. As we're already seeing, we may face some headwinds in our developed markets while emerging markets appear to be more able and used to coping with volatile economic situations. In consumer interactive, we would expect headwinds to largely persist as consumers scrutinize their spending and as lenders reduce marketing with lead generators.  I'll close out this review with some comments on our recent acquisitions. Starting with Neustar, we expect both the communications and fraud businesses to be largely unaffected in a downturn. Marketing business is roughly 80% subscription revenue and helps customers more efficiently resolve consumer identities as well as execute and measure marketing campaigns, something that we believe will retain its value throughout the cycle. Notably, the new start marketing business only declined 1% in 2020, despite a sharp reduction in marketing spending that year. Sontiq should also hold up relatively well as 75% of their revenue is B2B2C, largely sold through benefits brokers and insurance companies. And Argus would continue to provide significant value across the cycle based on unique portfolio analytics to card issuers. So net-net, we believe that our portfolio would weather a downturn well on a relative basis and still be capable of generating revenue growth at attractive margins.  This is possible because of our expansive diversified portfolio of relevant solutions and our deep partnerships built on thought leadership. In a downturn, we would keep our focus on integrating recent strategic acquisitions to ensure they deliver against our long-term expectations. And like we did in the second quarter of this year, we would manage our cost structure to ensure it aligns with the trajectory of revenue growth in order to deliver strong margin performance.  I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Hi. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I'm going to give you a response and Chris will add on. And I think it's an important one to hit off from the onset this morning. So I think what is probably most instructive to think about that $25 million ex-mortgage is just simply the growth rates that we had anticipated in our financial services business for consumer lending and for card and banking, we expected to be higher than what I would consider to be already really strong growth rates. And consumer lending, as Chris already said, we grew 29% and card and banking we were 17%. Our original guide contemplated something on consumer lending greater than 30% and for card and banking, obviously, then plus 20%. So when we set the guide in April, the signal that we were getting from the business at that point in time is that things were -- things were going to continue to be very, very strong for us in the quarter. So with that being said, that feeds off [ph] financial services. And if you go to other parts of the business, auto also is a challenge for us. I think that's pretty well documented, just due to the vehicle shortage. But nevertheless, we still were able to grow that business about 5% in the quarter. So, overall, really good. But another part of the non-financial services that I'd call out would be our tenant screening business. And in essence, what we're seeing are consumers that are staying put and they're not moving. So when that move of activity dwindles, that means less activity for TransUnion on our screening product."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. I'll begin with an overview of our financial results along with commentary on the economic conditions in our markets around the globe. I also would like to share highlights on the performance of our acquisitions and the progress we've made to integrate them and realize their full potential. Todd will then review in detail our second quarter results, our revised full year guidance and the changes to our business over recent years that should improve its performance during economic downturns.  Now throughout the first half of this year, economic conditions have been positive across our portfolio. Consumer employment, incomes, balance sheets, spending, savings rates and credit performance have been strong in most of the markets that we serve globally. We expect this favorable environment to continue over the balance of the year. That said, there are macroeconomic concerns emerging globally that could pressure consumer spending and growth over the intermediate term.  Materially higher interest rates and inflation worsened by supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainties could negatively affect economic conditions in 2023. These factors are more visible today in our developed markets such as the U.S., Canada and the UK. We will continue to watch the economic factors and overall consumer health across our global portfolio and react appropriately to changing conditions.  Now we also believe that we're well positioned to withstand an economic downturn due to our increased diversification across geographies, vertical markets, and solutions. Demand should remain strong during the slowdown across our emerging markets, where economic growth is inherently higher and credit utilization is expanding in the developing middle classes.  Also, verticals such as insurance, telecom, collections, and professional services, legal and law enforcement in the public sector run either neutral to or counter to economic cycles. And many of our solutions should perform well during slowdowns, including credit portfolio management, fraud mitigation, investigative solutions, performance analytics, and others. Todd will supply further perspective on our portfolio resiliency later in this call.  Now as you can see from our earnings release, we posted strong results for the second quarter and reissued solid guidance for the full year based on the strength of our core business and the positive contributions of our recent acquisitions. In the second quarter, TransUnion's organic constant currency revenue growth was 5% overall and 9% excluding U.S. mortgage revenues.  U.S. markets grew 13%, excluding mortgage. International grew 15% and consumer interactive declined 9% due to a series of market and TransUnion specific challenges, which I will discuss below. All results again are on an organic constant currency basis. In the U.S. markets in the second quarter, financial services, excluding mortgage, grew a robust 18% on the strength of consumer lending, which grew 29%, card and banking which grew 17% and auto, which managed to grow 5% despite inventory shortages.  Also, our insurance, media and public sector verticals grew by double digits organically. Our international segment grew 15% on an organic constant currency basis behind surging growth in our emerging markets of India, LatAm, APAC and Africa, and attractive growth in Canada and the UK after adjusting for nonrecurring revenues from the prior year. Also, sales momentum is accelerating across our international markets, as shown by increased pipelines and win rates that should propel growth throughout the second half of the year and beyond.  Now, our consumer segment declined 9% in the quarter due to a confluence of factors. The direct business declined materially in the quarter against the challenging comparisons of low double digit growth in the prior year. Also, we observed a slowdown in demand for paid credit services across the industry in the first half, especially compared to the higher growth of freemium offerings. TransUnion today has a small freemium service, and this represents an opportunity for our future growth.  Our indirect business also slowed, although not as much as direct, due to the industry-wide slowdown we observed. Indirect results also were affected by several contract restructurings last year, as we secured longer-term commitments for increased volumes. We expect to grow through this revenue compression over the course of this year. Encouragingly, sales of identity protection and breach services are exceeding expectations.  We secured multiple new material deals in the quarter, which would not have been possible prior to the acquisition of Sontiq. We have therefore shifted more of our consumer advertising spend to identity protection services given their strong performance. We expect that it will take several quarters to work through the current challenges in our consumer business related to contract restructurings and optimal product and marketing strategies.  And now turning to our revised full year guidance for 2022, we have reduced enterprise organic growth expectations, excluding U.S. mortgage, from 11% to 9.5% at the guidance midpoints. As the organic growth bridge shows, our revised guidance reflects adjustments in several factors, including the shortfall in second quarter results, a lower mortgage forecast given the rapid increase in rates and falling volumes, modestly lower growth in U.S. markets, excluding mortgage, as we reduce our forecast and financial services to the mid teens versus our earlier guide of approximately 20%.  The near-term retrenchment and consumer interactive as we adjust our marketing strategies absorb compression from restructurings and accelerate our sales of identity and breach services. And finally, foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar. Now overall, our revenue guidance for 2022 is still very compelling on the strength of rebounding economic activity from pandemic re-openings, positive consumer financial health, TransUnion's attractive market positions and our strong execution of our growth playbook. And in addition to strong organic revenue growth, we expect to deliver on organic adjusted EBITDA margin of about 40%.  Now turning to our three acquisitions, we made substantial progress integrating them into TransUnion over the first half of this year. Each of the acquisitions is performing in line with our acquisition cases, and the expectations we communicated previously. Importantly, the feedback and results in our early days of owning these assets are proving the rationales for their acquisition and the power of combining them into TransUnion. In the quarter, Neustar revenues grew mid single digits as we expected against a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2021, where growth surged over the pandemic lockdown in 2020. We now expect revenue growth for the full year in the mid single digits based on the implementation of record sales wins from last year, which included a Fortune 10 enterprise and accelerating adoption of branded and trusted call solutions in the communications vertical. Now this is tempered somewhat by market volume uncertainty and the timing of new customer onboarding.  The business delivered 24% adjusted EBITDA margin due to the revenue fall through and ahead of target execution of our cost reduction programs. We are confident that we will migrate Neustar's technology assets to a new cloud provider with more favorable rates by the end of this year and close eight data centers as well.  Additionally, we are realizing the cost synergies that we expected through combining our general and administrative functions. Given our progress achieving our cost reduction goals, we expect to reach a 26% adjusted EBITDA margin by year end. And importantly, we will keep or accelerate our investment in areas that drive revenue growth and product innovation, which are proving to be considerable.  Now market feedback has been positive on the benefits of combining TransUnion and Neustar's credit marketing and fraud prevention capabilities. Therefore, we have accelerated the integration of our marketing and fraud solutions and key functions such as analytics, technology, and sales. A top priority is to incorporate TransUnion's troves of data into Neustar's OneID platform to enhance its effectiveness. The bulk of this program will be completed by the end of this year.  We also are integrating our joint audience data and functionality, including commerce signals data from Argus into a single platform and creating common identity capabilities to support TransUnion solutions enterprise wide. In this quarter, we launched an innovative marketing cleanroom that integrates client and TU data in a single compliant and privacy-enabled environment to enhance audience building, performance analytics, and collaboration generally. This cleanroom solution will be offered directly to customers and through most of the major marketing technology platform providers.  Within our newly integrated fraud business, we are executing a unified product strategy that integrates our various knowledge based device, behavioral and telephonic solutions into a common interface with a single orchestration layer on a common analytic platform. We expect a beta version of this next generation solution to be available early next year. Finally, our efforts to cross sell this expanded suite of solutions are building momentum as we experienced growing pipelines with a strong level of conversion. Across all solutions cross selling, we have more than 150 deals in various stages of our sales pipeline, including about half in the later stages. And in the first half of 2022, our increasingly integrated marketing solutions grew double digits.  Now turning to Sontiq, it generated almost 24 million in revenue in the second quarter, down slightly versus expectations as it compared to our quarter last year with revenues from a large breach. We have fully integrated the sale of credit access and monitoring with identity protection and breach remediation, and build a robust pipeline with significant new sales, including a major competitive takeaway that would not have been possible without Sontiq solutions. We expect that our increased level of new sales will result in accelerated growth starting in 2023.  Overall, Sontiq's revenues for the full year are trending slightly ahead of plan and our cost integration efforts are continuing to pace. We expect mid teens revenue growth this year and almost a 40% margin, excluding integration costs. And I'll conclude my deal updates with the acquisition of the businesses that were previously part of the Verisk Financial Services group.  As a reminder, there are six businesses in this portfolio and we've decided to keep Argus insights and Commerce Signals and to divest the remaining companies due to a lack of strategic fit with TransUnion. The retained businesses generated revenue of about 95 million in 2021. We have moved the other companies to discontinued operations and are currently marketing them to prospective buyers. Thus far, we have received robust interest and we'll keep you apprised as the sale process develops. Now in the quarter, we realized revenue from Argus and Commerce Signals of 22 million, up 4% and at a margin of 20% or 25%, excluding the integration costs. We've already seen strong levels of customer interest in finding new ways to use the Argus data and insights, which have led to many requests for joint discovery engagements. As we integrate Argus over the year, we expect revenue growth in the low single digits with a 31% margin, excluding integration costs.  Next year, our plan is for growth to increase to the high single digits and then reach low double digits in 2024 with the margin expanding in these years, as we trend toward our enterprise goal of a 40% margin in 2026. Now revitalizing the delivery of Argus data on TransUnion's digital platforms as well as using our thought leadership will be key to realizing these higher sales levels.  And before I turn the time over to Todd, I want to take a moment to welcome two new Board members to TransUnion, Hamidou Dia and Ravi Kumar. Hamidou is the Vice President and Global Head of Solutions Engineering at Google Cloud, where he leads the global solution engineering organization. His expertise in both cloud architecture and digital transformation will guide us as we continue to build out our state-of-the-art technology infrastructure.  Ravi is the President of Infosys, a global IT consulting and services company, where he leads the Infosys Global Services Organization across all industry segments. He brings extensive experience in reimagining and reinventing technology services that will help shape the solutions and products we develop. That wraps my update on our market backdrop, second quarter performance and the integration of our recent acquisitions.  I'll now turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our second quarter financial results and our third quarter and full year guidance. So, Todd, over to you. Thank you, Todd. To conclude, TransUnion delivered another good quarter and we're set up for a strong full year with 9% to 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding mortgage, and with an organic EBITDA margin of about 40%. And we continue to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions and to find additional confirmation of the investment thesis for each deal.  Now, let me turn the time back over to Aaron. Yes. And just to provide some further context, starting with the tenant screening, we still had strong growth in that vertical. It's just as interest rates increase and as home prices increase, a lot of consumers get priced out of the purchase market. They look to the rental market. That demand has led to a spike in rent prices which leads to consumers getting priced out of that. So as a result, move velocity decreases and our volume decreases. But again, I think the broader context here is really important. When we guided 20%, that reflected significant outperformance relative to the market. Now that we're guiding in the mid teens, that still reflects significant outperformance in the market. So, look, it's unfortunate that we dropped the guide a little bit in core U.S. markets, but we do feel very strong about how we're competing in the market. We continue to broaden and deepen our relationships with those clients. And again, as I said, I think we're doing very well relatively. Yes. Look, I'll break it down for you, Jeff. Look, we expected some softness this year as we guided. We came in the second quarter a little bit softer. That said, going back to the basics and the dynamics, our consumer business is 40% direct, 60% indirect. On the direct side, going back for more than a year, we have been growing low teens, sometimes mid teens. What we experienced this quarter, though, and really in the first half of the year, was just diminished performance in our acquisition efforts as we look across the industry and we've got a good industry perspective, because we've got relationships with all the players, we see an industry-wide slowdown in demand for paid credit subscriptions and a strong shift to the freemium model. So that drove the reduction in the direct performance. And we're recalibrating our marketing efforts to compensate for that. We will also place a greater emphasis on our own freemium offerings. On the indirect side, again, yes, we had some contract restructurings that are going to cause revenue compression over the course of this year, but the trade off was extending the duration and winning higher volume commitments over time. So we would expect that to return to growth after we lap this year of compression. In addition to that and particularly with the addition of Sontiq now, we have had some really good new sales. We've really boosted our ability to compete for breach and identity with that addition. And we're bringing on a couple of major partners that reflect our competitiveness. And the sales pipeline and the closes have never been bigger. So the combination on the indirect side of lapping the price compression from contract restructuring and the sales pipeline and the new wins and their ramp, I think that positions us well for '23. And on the direct side, we'll have to continue to work on our marketing strategies and turn that around in subsequent quarters as well. Yes, sure, Heather. Like all of you, we're looking at a lot of data. We're looking at overall market data in the countries in which we compete, we're looking at consumer health, and we're looking at current demand across our various lines of business. Obviously, we're concerned by rising inflation. And we know over time, it's going to sap consumer discretionary spending and it could challenge credit performance in certain categories. We have been clear, though, that we haven't seen that materialize in our financials thus far, although it's certainly present in our developed markets. We see it in the U.S., we see it particularly in the UK, and there's been a diminishment in consumer spending in the UK recently, and some of that in Canada. So clearly historic cloud's [ph] out and that's kind of where you said the economic environment is less certain in 2023. But currently, if you look at our lenders, marketing activity remains strong. The fintechs are particularly aggressive in client acquisition and they have got adequate funding to continue to originate. Card volume is really strong. And again, as we pointed out, despite the diminishment in auto supply, we still managed to grow 5%. Now, of course, we have tempered mortgage expectations. We've reduced our inquiry expectations down 40% to 45% for the year translating in revenue fall off in the low 30s. And again, we're doing our best to estimate that and we're facing an industry increase coming up. But overall, marketing and origination volumes remained strong, delinquencies remain quite modest. And so the consumer is healthy. But again, we can't ignore the impact of higher rates and inflation and what that might bring over time. Yes, thanks for your question, Ashish. And look, obviously, we've watched the performance of the major ad tech players and we've seen a drop in their revenue trajectories and their equity values and the like. And certainly some of that reflects diminished levels of advertising. It's hard to separate, though, from the impact that certain privacy measures like the elimination of IDFA and the diminishment of third party cookies is having on their ability to target consumers and to articulate their performance. And so that's a structural shift that's happening in their side of the business. Drawing a distinction to train Neustar and our marketing capabilities as we've explained before, we resolve identity based on a broad range of factors, of which those mobile ad IDs and identifiers are just one of a range. And we have a very high proportion of our identity resolved based on first party data relationships, which are not diminishing, right? So I feel like we're fairly well protected against that structural performance decline. Now looking at Neustar this year and in the next, I think let's start with '21 performance. '21 was a very strong year for Neustar. It grew 8% plus and it reflected both their strongest year of new sales in their history, and it was really across their several product lines, but also a surge in the volumes that reflected just the economic re-openings and a rebound in activity and marketing, and also in call center and just economic engagement broadly. So we built our projections off of that volume foundation. What we're seeing across our communications business and a bit in the marketing as well is somewhat of a diminishment of volume as we're not getting the same bounce coming out of the pandemic re-openings as we did last year, but it is being largely offset by ramping revenue from the sales success that we had last year. And that's why we're comfortable guiding in the mid single digits. And again, we're trying to be prudent here in our guidance in the early days of our ownership, as we really get to understand the factors that drive volume across these three business lines. We're also really pleased with the sales pipeline that we've developed in '22 and the close rates. And our goal for the year is to equal or exceed last year's record level of sales. And I believe that we can do it. We don't guide across pipelines, but things are looking quite solid. The second half of the year is important for us in Neustar though because we have to onboard a lot of the clients that we won last year. One of those clients, I said a top 10 Fortune enterprise, it's really one of the largest companies in the world. They bought the entire suite of Neustar marketing solutions, just reinforcing the value and the interconnection between these products. And we're spending a lot of time onboarding that, and they're going to be a major source of new revenue for us going forward. So it's just an example of kind of the intensive heads down, new win onboarding that's taking place this year that in my opinion ultimately reflects the health of the business. We're competing well. We're winning. We're gaining share. And look, the volumes are going to be -- we're going to have to see what they're going to be over the course of these first couple of years and just the uncertainties in the market going into 2023. Yes, I think what I would say is, look, some of your characterization, I do agree with, and we have reduced our growth expectations for U.S. markets for the year. If you focus on the financial services component, we had an ambitious guide around 20%. It was founded in the trajectory of the business at the time. Now we're guiding into the mid teens range, if you will. Some of that diminishment is mortgage, which I think everybody's familiar with. And the other parts of it reflect not growing as fast as the exceptionally strong growth that we experienced -- that we projected. But Toni, what I want to be clear is if you compare the growth rates that we outlined our guide, it was materially higher than the market and our performance thus far as well as our guide for the full year reflects material outperformance. So we are really positive on the business and very positive on the guide. And at this point, we haven't seen any diminishment in lender performance or consumer strength, right? So I want to be really clear on that. The other part is the emerging markets business, which is an increasing portion we're forecasting roughly 8% growth organic over the course of the year. We have many components that are growing double digits by insurance and media and tenant and employment screening, the whole diversified markets portfolio in public sector. So while the guide is down a bit, growing low double digits is terrific. And I think you can -- if you just step back and look at this in the broad, you can only characterize our U.S. market's performance as exceptionally strong. Yes. So, look, our international division is performing exceptionally well, mid teens organic, and within that the emerging components really, really strong growth. What I need to point out, though, is, well, first of all, overall, and certainly in the international portfolio, there is some increased challenge in forecasting results, because we have got to -- we're modeling the degree of rebound due to pandemic re-openings. In emerging markets, the shutdowns were particularly severe a year ago in India and in the Philippines and in Hong Kong. Those economies are considerably more open. It's not wide open right now, and so economic activity is returning to a more normal level. And the normal level is higher inherent economic growth than the developed markets. So GDP growth, you would expect just to be higher, and that's true even during a downturn. On top of that, you've got rising middle classes that are expanding their use of traditional credit. And so you've got the additional growth element there. So that's why we believe our emerging markets structurally will produce higher growth. Now in the quarter, India grew 51%. I would not advise you to update the CAGR for India to 51%. But it is going to remain a dramatic grower as is most of our emerging portfolio. And we look at our international business, in particular our emerging markets, and our core U.S. market's B2B business as key pillars of our outperformance. Yes. Well, look, a good portion of it relates to the execution of our cost programs for the acquisitions. And you guys will recall that with the Neustar acquisition in particular, they were executing a pretty dramatic cost restructuring on the technology side, which consisted of changing cloud providers and also shuttering a lot of the data centers as a result. And we have been able to confirm that we can deliver all of those savings and we are well down the path toward executing that over the course of the year. The other component was the natural synergies that we would expect in general administrative expenses as we combined Neustar into TransUnion. Those are proceeding ahead of plan and that's one of the reasons why our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year are going to be at 26% on that deal. So we're very pleased about the progress and driving the EBITDA from our acquisitions and we're confident that we can deliver on that dimension. Now in the broad though, of course, we are looking at our overall spending, as most companies are doing, and we're prioritizing where we invest. However, we're remaining highly investment focused. The way to get shareholder value out of these deals and out of the transformational efforts that we've got on operations and technology and around our centers of excellence is through execution. We got to get the work done to deliver the economic benefit. And I feel like we're tracking extremely well. Now, of course, we're going to be smart on where we travel, where we entertain, where we add incremental heads, et cetera. But again, we are leaning in to acquisition integration, product innovation, and business restructuring. Well, Manav, we provided the detailed breakdown in Q2, because it demonstrates the strength of our performance in financial services. We've [indiscernible] an overall guide for U.S. markets for the year. We haven't broken it down though. But I think independent of the breakdown you should assume that growth is going to continue to be very strong in those categories over the course of '22. Now we're trying to be conservative in our mortgage forecast. As you can see, we are probably at the top of the market in reducing the inquiry volume that we expect in the revenue flow through. So we really tried to derisk on the mortgage side. But as you know, Manav, that's tricky business and we're facing another three quarter point increase. We'll have to see how the market reacts. But we've tried to model that and model it to the conservative side. Yes. Well, I should emphasize that a big portion of our revenues from this division comes from supporting freemium players to the indirect. That's been our largest avenue of participation. And some of those agreements have been restructured to offer some, let's say, relief in the near term in exchange for duration and volume increases over time. So we're going to continue to benefit from freemium because we have kind of a supportive industry neutral relationship, if you will. And that has been a unique attribute of TransUnion for a long time. We also have our own freemium offering. It's relatively modest. And as we reformulate our marketing strategies based on our current rate of customer needs, we're probably going to increase the emphasis there. Now does this suggest some economic distress? I don't know. I wouldn't put my finger on that. I think it probably just reflects the prevalence of freemium offering, the wide availability and the need to kind of embrace that model where the basic credit report will be free, but then there's the opportunity to sell value-added services like identity protection and scores, and of course lead generation to lenders as upside."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. That done, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome. To start, let me outline the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll discuss the mostly positive macro conditions that support our attractive full year guidance despite inflationary headwinds, then I'll review our strong first quarter performance, which has been driven by favorable macro conditions and the resurgence of our growth-oriented portfolio post pandemic, the cumulative benefit of the strong sales performance over the pandemic and our successful innovations over time. I'm pleased to report that our outperformance year-to-date and confidence in the remainder of the year allow us to raise revenue and EBITDA guidance for the full year, and I'll provide an update on the impactful acquisitions that we've closed over the past 4 months. For Neustar and Sontiq in particular, we've experienced early successes in going to market together, with really encouraging interest from customers across a wide variety of end markets. And then I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first quarter results in detail, along with second quarter and full year guidance for 2022. Now as I mentioned previously, we expect market conditions in 2022 to support our strong organic revenue guidance, along with the post-pandemic resurgence in our growth-oriented portfolio, especially in consumer lending, U.S. emerging verticals and the international markets. While a lot of the focus today is justifiably on rising inflation and the long-term impacts of this, I want to remind you that the U.S. consumer remains in a strong position with respect to credit markets. Household debt levels relative to income remain low by historical standards. Average credit card balances are well below prepandemic levels, and delinquency rates for most loans are near record low levels. Additionally, the unemployment rate in March fell to 3.6%, and wages grew by 5.6%. Despite increasing inflation, consumers remain well positioned to drive the economy. We heard as much from many large financial institutions this quarter who provided positive and pragmatic guidance during the recent earnings, noting the current strength in loan growth, spending activity and credit performance, but also acknowledging the potential uncertainty ahead. We continue to diligently monitor consumer health, particularly lower income households that have less ability to absorb rising costs. As the Fed seeks to curb inflation, rising interest rates have become an important corollary discussion. As such, I'll end this section by addressing the impact that interest rates have on our various lines of business. While rates certainly have an impact on the lending market, the overall health of the consumer, which I've just described, has greater influence on borrowing behavior and rates in most cases. Mortgage refinance represents the one part of the lending market almost entirely driven by interest rates. The simple math dictates whether or not it makes sense for a consumer to refinance a mortgage. And unsurprisingly, rates have some impact on purchase originations, though consumers don't shop based solely on rates. They shop based on a monthly payment where rates are one part of the calculation, along with the purchase price, the down payment and the long terms. For auto and card lending, rates have a very modest impact given the balances the average American carries. For instance, for every 0.25-point increase in rates, that translates into an increase in the monthly payment on the average card balance by only $1. So we tend to see far less impact from rising rates for these loan products. Now shifting to our first quarter. We posted strong results that exceeded our guidance, with broad-based growth across our businesses as our regions and verticals benefited from positive momentum buoyed by the healthy consumer as well as business wins and ongoing innovations. As Todd will discuss in detail, our first quarter outperformance and an improved view of our nonmortgage business for the remainder of the year has allowed us to raise our full year guidance. We did that while also embedding a more aggressive assumption around mortgage declines, implying broad and significant acceleration in our nonmortgage business. We continue to drive above-market performance by executing our growth playbook that focuses on repeatable, differentiated go-to-market approaches, industry-leading innovation and complementary expansion into adjacent markets. Our extension into high-growth and complementary credit fraud and marketing solutions continues to resonate with customers across our business while providing valuable diversification in our portfolio. In U.S. markets, we delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth, excluding mortgage, with strong performance in Financial Services, Insurance and Media. This highlights our very strong position in fintech and other fast-growing market segments. Internationally, we experienced robust growth in India, Latin America and Asia Pacific, where we have leadership positions in these markets, and they have strong underlying growth trends. Todd will provide more details about the performance of each of these businesses shortly. And let me wrap up with a short summary on our ESG efforts. We recently published our 2021 diversity report, which highlights steady improvement in the diversification of our workforce across underrepresented groups. And last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which provides a broad picture of the progress we made last year, including issuing baseline carbon emissions data, setting a net-zero emissions goal, improving workforce diversity, further enhancing our cybersecurity and data privacy oversight, along with many other achievements. I hope you'll all take time to read these meaningful updates. Now I want to use the remainder of my time to share with you the performance of the 3 acquisitions that we've closed over the past 4 months. But before I do that, I want to highlight that the current market backdrop that I described a few minutes ago really accentuates the value of our recent acquisitions, particularly with Neustar and Verisk Financial Services. Now both of these can help lenders find attractive segments within the market and drive timely insights via the changing landscape. Now starting with Neustar. The acquisition substantially strengthens our identity resolution capability for a variety of online applications. Neustar provides real-time identity resolution through its OneID platform, powering solutions that currently serves 3 attractive markets: marketing, cloud mitigation and communications. In the first quarter, Neustar generated $150 million of revenue, up 9% in total, with another quarter of double-digit growth in marketing and at a margin of nearly 25%. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress integrating Neustar and have received some really encouraging feedback from the market and gained valuable learnings from customers that support the long-term growth thesis. Internally, we've completed our organizational design efforts quickly in order to provide clarity and ensure retention of critical employees. This has helped us retain nearly 100% of the top talent that we've identified thus far. I want to note the very high-caliber workforce that we've acquired with Neustar, and we benefit from quickly and efficiently expanding our talent in critical areas like technology, data science, product development and many others. In the current competitive environment, adding so many high-quality employees would have been extremely difficult. We've also brought together critical functions to fully benefit from our increased scale and capabilities. For instance, by standing up data and analytics as its own organization under the leadership of Venkat Achanta, we brought further clarity and purpose through a critical area of our business. Now Venkat has extensive experience in data and analytics, and most notably drove the development of Neustar's impressive OneID platform. Our internal teams have already benefited from collaborating with each other as part of one newly formed org and setting the stage to better leverage the powerful assets and capabilities of both companies. Now speaking of OneID. Through the integration process, we've learned the platform performs even better than we understood during our diligence, particularly the system's ability to rapidly ingest, index and tag data to prepare it for analytic and solution development and deployment is more advanced than we understood. This increases our ability to utilize data assets and put them into production rapidly. From a commercial standpoint, we've begun to integrate our sales teams, including extensive training to drive cross-selling activities across customers and solution types. Now let me share some of the early views and successes from the field. The more substantial and differentiated marketing solutions from Neustar, combined with our TruAudience offerings, have already opened the door to opportunities in our fast-growing Media vertical. Our teams have taken a coordinated approach to actively pursuing these opportunities and have early traction with key clients. In Financial Services, we secured our first cross-sell contract of Neustar solutions to a mid-tier lender, and we've had extremely high interest levels as we continue to meet with other customers. In the Insurance markets, Neustar currently provides its sophisticated solutions to 3 of the top underwriters in the U.S. Our combined teams recently met with one of the largest insurers and heard how impactful Neustar's marketing solutions have been for that customer as they spend billions of dollars on marketing each year, and they indicated that their return on their marketing investment has improved significantly as a result of the Neustar optimization solution. And given that TransUnion currently has relationships with 19 of the 20 -- the top 20 largest insurers in the U.S. and an array of other players, we think there's a sizable opportunity to bring the same type of marketing capabilities to the rest of our client base who also spend considerably on marketing and are consistently looking for ways to drive better returns. And in third-party collections, we signed our first cross-sell contract with an existing TransUnion customer who will now use Neustar's phone-based intelligence to identify the best time to call individuals to improve their hit rate on outbound collections calls. The now integrated sales team has attended major trade collection shows recently and discussed similar solutions with the almost 50 existing TransUnion new clients. And let me end by reminding you about the financial expectations for this business. In 2022, we expect Neustar to deliver another year of high single-digit organic revenue growth driven by strong performance in marketing and fraud. We expect the business to deliver low double-digit revenue growth beginning in '23 and beyond, and we're expecting roughly $160 million of adjusted EBITDA in '22, which would imply a 25% margin. Now supporting the improvement in 2022 and our path to deliver 40% margins by 2025, we have a clear line of sight to at least $70 million in cost synergies and have become increasingly confident as we've progressed through the integration process. In part, Neustar has begun its cost reduction program before we acquired them, and that included activities like consolidating 8 data centers and 2 colocation sites. At the same time, we are benefiting from working together. For instance, we're leveraging data sets across organizations to reduce costs related to the name, address, phone and e-mail data that we collect by millions of dollars. And we've also begun to consolidate office locations in Chicago and London, which will both happen this year. Now turning to Sontiq, which provides an entry point into the fast-growing ID protection market that's been driven by rapid e-commerce evolution. In this environment, consumers have heightened awareness of and a concern about the risks of identity theft. Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market, fueling strong long-term growth. In the first quarter, Sontiq generated roughly $23 million in revenue, up approximately 13%, at a margin of roughly 33%, which was slightly depressed by integration costs. Also during the quarter, we began our integration activities and have seen meaningful opportunities materialize. Our teams are fully leveraging our global capabilities in areas such as operations and solutions, and expanding their go-to-market collaboration between our Consumer Interactive teams and their U.S. Market counterparts, especially in Financial Services and Insurance, but also across our international teams as well. For instance, we've positioned ourselves to bid on a sizable nonfinancial services contract in the identity protection space based on the addition of Sontiq's expansive solution suite, which we believe will be the first of many such opportunities. We're also off to an encouraging start selling Sontiq solutions to our network of insurance underwriters. Insurance represents about a quarter of Sontiq's revenue today, and we see a clear path to expand that position on the strength of our relationships in the space. We've identified similar opportunities across our U.S. Markets portfolio. Notably, in Financial Services, our customers are showing a strong interest in Sontiq's capabilities. And based on the existing momentum in the business and the ongoing integration, Sontiq is currently trending ahead of the plan, and we expect mid-teens revenue growth for 2022, excluding integration costs, at a nearly 40% margin. Now let me wrap up with the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services. We completed the transaction on April 8 and have decided to retain Argus and Commerce Signals, a marketing business, and to classify the remainder of the portfolio as discontinued operations with an intention to sell these assets. As a reminder, the business in total generated $143 million of revenue in 2021, with about $95 million coming from Argus and Commerce Signals. The decision to divest the noncore assets will focus our energy on enhancing the core Argus asset while also allowing the other business to benefit from new ownership. Argus brings differentiated card and deposit transaction data as well as the IP to link the personalized transaction data across sources to create a consumer level full wallet view. With this, we'll be able to deliver enhanced insight to action to measurable outcomes for Argus' consortium members. Argus increases TransUnion's thought leadership and insights, helping our customers develop more refined strategies to target profitable consumers or to identify sophisticated patterns of card fraud. We can help our customers take action on those insights with TransUnion solutions, whether they are traditional credit-based or noncredit-based through our Neustar capability. And we'll be able to do this through a unified platform powered by Prama and OneID. And we're happy to report that we're getting very positive feedback from the existing consortium members about our ownership and their desire for enhanced insights delivered using a modern technology-enabled platform. We've also heard from lenders who have not participated in the consortium, and many have expressed interest in joining in order to benefit from Argus' powerful data and insights. As we integrate Argus in 2022, we anticipate growth in the low single digits, though at a temporarily depressed margin as we absorb the necessary integration costs. In '23, we expect growth to improve to high single digits and then reach low double digits in 2024, with the margins expanding over this period as we trend toward our goal of 40% margins in 2026. Now that wraps up my update on our market backdrop, the first quarter performance and the integration of these 3 key acquisitions. Now I'll turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our first quarter financial results, our second quarter guidance and the full year guide as well. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone this morning. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 32% on a reported and constant currency basis. Neustar and Sontiq added about 25 points to revenue, and organic constant currency growth was 8%. Excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2021 and 2022, our business grew 13% on an organic constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 10% of our revenue, and that is expected to fall to 7% for full year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% on a reported and 21% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, down 340 basis points compared with the year ago quarter driven primarily by the lower margin profile of Neustar. Excluding both the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, the margin would have been 38.8%. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 11% driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Now looking at segment financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Markets revenue was up 42% compared to the year ago quarter. The Neustar acquisition had about 35 points of impact on revenue growth. Organic growth was 7% or 15%, excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Markets increased 23% on an as reported and 2% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 580 basis points, with 380 basis points of the decline due to the acquisition of Neustar. Diving into the results by vertical. Please note that at this time, we have included Neustar's financial results within Emerging Verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial Services revenue grew 5% and was up 21%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets. Consumer lending continues to be very strong, with considerable investor demand focused on thoughtful expansion, particularly as loan consolidation and personal loans for large purchases have become more mainstream. Our BNPL position also continues to grow on the strength of the market and share gains. Based on our discussions with many of the largest BNPL lenders, we are also confident that during 2022, we will enable them to furnish data. This will enrich our credit data for all lenders while promoting greater financial inclusion as consumers who utilize BNPL loans will get credit, no pun intended, for their activity. We also had another strong quarter in our credit card business as issuers pursued incremental share of wallet, continuing a trend of historically strong origination and marketing activity. We anticipate further good growth in 2022 as issuers remain focused on customer acquisition and portfolio review. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well-publicized inventory issues for new and used cars even as consumer demand remains high. We're seeing traction with Auto Payment Shopper, a digital retailing platform that satisfies consumer desire for end-to-end online auto shopping. We're also seeing greater interest in CreditVision Link to better assess consumers and drive greater financial inclusion by utilizing powerful alternative data. And for mortgage, rates have moved to their highest level since 2018, which considerably shrinks the potential refinancing pool. On the purchase side, consumer demand remained solid but continues to be constrained by limited inventory, particularly in highly desirable locations and rising rates. At this time, we expect our mortgage business revenue to decline about 25% for full year 2022. We expect the mortgage market as measured by inquiries to be down 30%. We expect our business to perform slightly better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases that partially offset the volume declines. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 104% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. Our Media vertical continues to deliver very strong double-digit growth and was up about 50% organically in the quarter as we signed new accounts and expanded existing relationships with a large media agency and several very large media companies focused on video and streaming platforms. The TruAudience marketplace, which was built from the TruOptik acquisition, continues to deliver substantial growth. Notably, these acquisitions don't reflect any of the anticipated upside from incorporating highly differentiated Neustar marketing capabilities, which we believe can drive further upside in the future. Insurance also delivered double-digit growth on the strength of key innovative solutions like DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, TLO-based investigative tools, continued traction in digital marketing enabled by the TruAudience platform and expanding opportunities in both the commercial and life markets. Public Sector delivered another good quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. Tenant and employment screening remains strong as employment screening has accelerated with increased employment levels and tenant screening continues to perform well, though with moderation as movement has slowed due to the soaring rental prices and extended eviction moratoriums. Consumer Interactive, which includes Sontiq, revenue increased 15% on a reported basis and declined 3% organically as we were down in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. Revenue was impacted by moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, particularly with changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID. We expect this broad market theme to persist and for the segment revenue to be down slightly more in the second quarter than in the first quarter. This trend further strengthens the case or expanding into the identity protection market via the Sontiq acquisition as those subscriptions are more durable over time and are often provided to consumers by employers, insurers and others. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 18% as we saw underlying market improvement in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for International increased 18% as a result of the strong revenue growth. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 15%. We continue to benefit from a meaningful onetime government contract. Excluding that revenue, our U.K. business would have grown about 3% in the quarter as the mortgage and auto markets have been under pressure due to increasing rates and inventory constraints. This 3% growth rate was also impacted by comparability with some onetime revenue seen in Q1 2021, so underlying performance was high single digits. Also recall that the benefits of the government contract started in Q2 2021 and ramped through Q1 2022, so we expect reported growth to be impacted as we lap the contract starting next quarter. Most importantly, we expect underlying growth to remain healthy. So moving back to the quarterly performance in the U.K., we continue to see solid performance across our lending solutions, most notably in the fast-growing BNPL space. In fact, in February, we became the first U.K. bureau able to accept BNPL data into our credit files. Working closely with prominent BNPL providers, we can now incorporate this data into credit reports to support consumers that are using this type of point-of-sale finance while also ensuring lenders have a comprehensive picture of a borrower's financial position. We also continue to see strength in our gaming and gambling vertical, which is benefiting from our ability to employ open banking solutions to help online and physical casinos better determine a participant's capacity to bet. This solution helps the operator and the bettor set appropriate limits and is highly encouraged by regulators. Our Canadian business grew 1% in the first quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio partially offset by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter, which I have mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the nonrecurring breach business, revenue would have grown 4%. We expect to see a similar breach impact in the second quarter and a less significant effect in the second half of the year. We continue to see strength across the business with improving demand and growing pipelines from both traditional and nontraditional lenders, setting us up well for stronger growth in the coming quarters. In India, we grew 37%, reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. This is helping to drive an expected GDP of 7%, along with 9% growth in the credit market in 2022, fueled by a resurgence in consumer lending and credit card issuance, along with the continued rise of fintech and BNPL players. We have outstanding positions across the entire lending spectrum, including with these players, allowing us to capture this meaningful market growth while also outperforming the underlying market. This outperformance is driven by our innovative approach to the market, strong relationships and continued diversification into the fast-growing businesses like commercial credit and direct-to-consumer. In Latin America, revenue was up 17%, with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This very strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, along with ongoing new business wins and share shifts in Financial Services, and particularly with fintechs and neobanks, and continued strong uptake of CreditVision and fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 25% driven by continued good performance in Hong Kong and the start of recovery in the Philippines, which had been under lockdown longer than any of our other markets. Finally, Africa increased 9% on the continued strength of our Insurance and retail businesses as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market, South Africa. We also continue to see additional adoption of CreditVision, TruValidate and our commercial credit solutions. We ended the quarter with roughly $6 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and pro forma leverage of 3.5x. Since quarter end, we have deployed $515 million of cash for the purchase of Verisk Financial Services and associated fees and also paid roughly $355 million in taxes associated with the sale of Healthcare. Factoring these payments, cash on the balance sheet would be closer to $400 million, in line with our more typical cash balances. Adding Verisk Financial Services to the equation but excluding those businesses classified as discontinued operations, we expect our pro forma leverage ratio to be approximately 3.9x in the second quarter as a result of deploying the cash held for taxes and purchasing Verisk Financial Services. However, we expect to delever to 3.6x by the end of 2022. We expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the noncore Verisk Financial Services business for general corporate purposes. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to quickly comment on free cash flow. You will notice our cash flow statement that first quarter 2022 cash from operations was lower than last year. This was primarily due to higher interest expense and increased usage of net working capital primarily related to higher incentive compensation. That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. All the guidance provided reflects the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services, though, notably, only Argus and related business called Commerce Signals as we are treating the noncore businesses as discontinued and intend to divest on. As a reminder, for 2021, Argus revenue was $95 million of the reported $143 million for Verisk Financial Services. The prorated amount contemplated in our 2022 guidance is $68 million based on the April 8 closing date. Starting on with the second quarter. We expect 1 point of headwind from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And for revenue, we anticipate a 27-point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. Revenue is expected to come in between $958 million and $968 million or a 32% to 33% increase on an as reported basis and 6% to 7% on an organic constant currency basis. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximately 4.5-point headwind from mortgage, meaning that the remainder of our business will grow 10.5% to 11.5% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $347 million to $353 million, an increase of 17% to 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 440 to 400 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and Verisk Financial Services' relatively lower margins. On an organic basis, excluding the 3 acquisitions, margins are expected to decrease approximately 50 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.96 and $0.99, an increase of 8% to 11%. And for the full year, we expect immaterial FX impact to revenue, and we also expect about 24 points of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.85 billion to $3.9 billion, up 30% to 32%. Our guidance includes 4 points of headwinds from mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis is expected to increase 10% to 12%, a 100 basis point increase over the guidance that we provided during our February earnings call driven by the first quarter outperformance and our improving full year outlook. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. Markets to be up mid-single digits, but up mid-teens, excluding mortgage. Financial Services is also expected to be up mid-single digits, but about 20% excluding mortgage. We expect Emerging Verticals to be up low double digits. We anticipate that International will grow low teens in constant currency terms, a slight increase over the previous guidance of low double digits, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits on an organic basis as a result of challenging prior year comparison. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.405 billion and $1.44 billion, up 21% to 24%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 260 to 220 basis points this year driven by the lower-margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq. Compared to prior guidance, the slightly greater margin decline is a result of adding the Argus business at a lower margin that is further compressed by integration costs. Without the Argus addition, margin would remain in the same range we provided previously, 36.9% to 37.4%. We also continue to expect the margin to expand about 40 basis points on an organic basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year is expected to be between $3.84 and $3.98, up 11% to 16%. The modest change in the top end of the range is most significantly a result of higher interest expense from rising LIBOR rates. A slight increase in our expected tax rate also impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share. Without these headwinds, adjusted earnings -- adjusted diluted earnings per share would be about $0.07 per share higher due to our increased adjusted EBITDA expectations. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022, at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, up slightly from 22.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million, and the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, is expected to be about $220 million, up from $215 million. We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $220 million, up from $205 million due to higher LIBOR and expectations of future LIBOR increases as implied by the forward curve. As a reminder, about 68% of our debt is fixed using hedge instruments, and 32% is floating. Let me spend a moment to recap our hedging philosophy. We want to ensure we leave sufficient room to prepay debt, which would lower leverage, decrease interest expense and therefore increase cash flow for other strategic purposes. We also want to avoid the potential of being overhedged, which would place TransUnion at speculative hedging position. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thanks, Todd. Well, to conclude, TransUnion delivered another strong quarter while also quickly integrating strategic acquisitions that further position us for long-term differentiated growth. We raised our guidance despite meaningfully de-risking our outlook with more aggressive expectations for mortgage declines. This reflects the strength and diversity of our portfolio. We expect another very good year in 2022 driven by the continuation of constructive market conditions and the execution of our growth playbook.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And that concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]. And now we'll be glad to take those questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. I wanted to ask about margin expansion after '22, and I know that was highlighted at -- to be 100 basis points per your Analyst Day. But I'm still reminded today that margins will be down this year due to acquisitions, and I did like Slide 16 where you show operating margins to be up 40 basis points this year on an organic basis. I'm just asking the basic question. How could we be assured that margins will expand in years ahead past '22, including potential acquisitions?\nTodd Cello: Andrew, this is Todd. I'll take that question. So as it pertains to our confidence in being able to expand margins beyond 2022, I think it's instructive is just to remember the growth drivers that we anticipate. First, we expect to continue to deliver very strong organic revenue growth, which has a very significant flow-through to the bottom line. So think about just the leading innovation that TransUnion has in many product categories. We're going to continue to deliver, and that will also -- that will bolster the bottom line. In addition to that, you have to then shift to the inorganic piece. So starting first just with the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and now the recently-closed Verisk Financial Services acquisitions. Neustar and Verisk Financial Services currently carry a significantly lower margin profile than TransUnion, where Sontiq primarily does have a margin similar to TransUnion's, but right now, it's being weighed down by normal integration costs to make Sontiq part of the business as it continues to grow. But if you go back to Neustar, and as Chris talked about in his remarks, the business generated a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. And we -- as that business continues to grow, which it did grow 9% in the quarter and we're expecting it to grow high single digits, there's a nice flow-through there, but don't forget also about the cost synergies that we committed to, which are $70 million, which we believe by the end of 2023, we will secure roughly about 80% or so of those synergies. So the team has been working very hard, as again Chris talked about, in being able to integrate the organization but also to find those cost savings. So we feel very confident about being able to deliver on that piece. And then Verisk Financial Services, which, as you've seen this morning, we have put in -- because of close on April 8, we put into our guide the businesses of Argus and Commerce Signals. And we will be divesting the remainder of the businesses. Right now, again, similar to Sontiq, those businesses are turning a lower margin, and it's primarily this year due to the integration expenses that I think you'd expect us to have to incur to make that business part of TransUnion. But again, importantly, again, as the future outlook for that business, as we begin to rank -- as it begins to be part of TransUnion and we're able to change the way we go to market with Argus as well as the way we deliver the product, that will have a significant impact on the profitability, and then the integration costs will eventually go away as well.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. And so, Andrew, those are all the right details. And we have a lot of confidence that we're going to deliver the margins that we've outlined. We reconfirmed full year guide. You can see improving margins in the core. With regard to Neustar, we're ahead of the initial guide that we provided when we acquired the business. So we've got a lot of confidence that we're executing in a way that will deliver the margins we've guided to.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: I want to acknowledge the good revenue performance before asking another margin question. But on Argus onboarding at a lower margin, I think you're implying that you're onboarding it at a lower margin than you previously expected, so would love some detail on that. Is it that the integration cost on the lower acquired EBITDA base because of the planned divestitures has that dilutive effect? Is there anything on how much you're planning to invest behind it or if the margins on the retained business were lower? Just any aspects like that, and then just any comment on the Q1 margin. I know that you had previously said that you took some of the conservatism out of your old guidance methodology with this guidance. But normally, when we see revenue upside, it comes with pretty good incremental margins. So any comment on Q1 margins?\nTodd Cello: Jeff, I'll take that one. And I think I'm hearing kind of a couple of different questions in there. I think you're asking, first, just about what happened with Argus and the expectations on margin, but then also you're asking about Q1. So why don't -- let me start with Q1 first and tell you just where we came in with margins. And so clearly, you can see that we did have a strong revenue performance, as you already indicated. We were $7 million higher than the high end of our guide on revenue, but adjusted EBITDA of $334 million was mid-range on the guide that we provided back in February. The drivers really kind of fall into 3 buckets for us, the first just simply being product mix. And with the increase in revenue, costs go up, but also that mix of revenue, there's some variable costs that drive that. So that's number one component. The second component primarily relates to compensation-related increases that we had within the quarter. I think there's some incentive comp. There's also some items that were just simply timing-related that we will capture later in the year. And then the third category was just the remediation efforts that we took pertaining to the data incident in South Africa. But I think what's most important to take away from the materials today is that, yes, margin was lower in Q1, but what we've committed to for the full year is to get the margin back to 37.4% before the Verisk Financial Services acquisition is included. So we're -- yes, Q1, expenses were a little bit higher, but we have -- we've managed that, within the updated guidance we've given, to be able to stay flat. If I flip over to your question pertaining to the Argus margin, lots of moving pieces. So I know most of the participants on this call are familiar with Verisk Financial Services and the financial profile, but -- and that's obviously everybody's starting point. But with us making the decision to hold the Argus and Commerce Signals only in -- to divest the other 4 businesses, there's a lot that move within those numbers. So that's kind of one thing. The second thing then, it is the M&A integration expense. We are not adding back, for our non-GAAP metrics, anything pertaining to the integration for Verisk Financial Services. We are for Neustar, right, just simply because of the time and the materiality. So -- and add Sontiq as well, too, just to clarify what we're doing. So Verisk gets burdened, and our integration efforts for Verisk, I'd say they're very aggressive. So meaning that there's a significant amount of spend that's contemplated in 2022 for that business.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. And just to be clear, we're right on track with Verisk, right? This is exactly what we expected, right? And it is our typical approach to not add back. We just made an exception with Neustar because of the size of the deal.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I wanted to ask a question with regards to the consumer and how you're thinking about the macro environment. And appreciate your call -- sorry, your color at the start of the call. But you talked about staying close to the lower-income consumer and watching them. Can you just talk about how your business is exposed to that consumer in particular and what you're seeing right now?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Sure. I'm happy to start this. Well, look, as we all know, the consumer in the U.S. overall, whether it be high income or lower income, is in very good shape. From a balance sheet perspective, consumers and households have delevered over the course of the pandemic. And at the lower end of the income spectrum, they were primary beneficiaries of that. There was a lot of forbearance of loan repayment during the pandemic as well as infusions of income from various government sources, right? On top of that, the employment market's incredibly robust. We're at 3.2% unemployment. There's almost 5 million jobs in the U.S. that are unfilled currently. Wages are increasing, ending in an abundance of employment opportunities. So we believe, and if you follow the banks as they reported their results earlier this season, they believe that the consumer is pretty well positioned. Now of course, there is the intermediate concern about rising inflation and the impact on consumers, particularly lower-income consumers, but there are offsetting factors like rising household income, high employment and relatively low credit card balances and leverage in general. So consumers have the ability to earn more and continue to consume, and there's still a lot of pent-up consumption coming out of the pandemic period, and they have the ability also to increase their leverage, right? So there's really a mix of issues that we think shades to the positive for 2022.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with RBC.\nAshish Sabadra: I just wanted to focus on the fintech and BNPL. You obviously talked about the strength there in the U.S. but also the international markets. I was just wondering, in your conversations with the fintech, have you -- have they indicated any kind of slowdown in demand or marketing activity, particularly going into the back half of the year? And also maybe just to tag onto that, you talked a lot about the Neustar and the cross-selling. Can you also talk about any traction of Neustar with your fintech customers as well?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. I'd be happy to. So the short answer to your question is no, the fintechs don't believe there's going to be any slowdown. And if you look at our results in the U.S. where we grew over 20% in Financial Services in the first quarter, a lot of that is resurgence among fintech and disproportionate contribution from the BNPL sector where we also have nice share. But overall, the consumer is strong, and lending is increasing. And we're very optimistic about our Financial Services performance for the full year, independent of the deflation we've got in the mortgage market because of rising interest rates. And again, what I would remind you of, and we commented on this earlier in the pandemic, but our portfolio is largely growth-oriented. And we are attacking and taking share in many of the markets in which we compete. We've got a disproportionate share of the emerging fintech and BNPL markets. We've got an international portfolio that skews toward higher-growth economies with emerging middle classes and increasing borrowing rates. And then if you look in the U.S., the emerging markets division, we have kind of attacker positions in insurance, in public sector, in the investigative solutions realm. And we think as the economy has now firmly emerged from the pandemic period, we're going to return to that growthful trajectory that we've demonstrated through the years.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe I was just wondering if you could talk about the Neustar traction in the fintech side, if you don't mind.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Well, look, Neustar services some of those companies today. With the partnership now with TransUnion, there's an enormous opportunity to cross-sell back and forth. Not just Neustar coming into fintech, but truly, the cross-sell potential is very exciting. Having spent a good deal of time both in Neustar and in Sontiq, I think our investment thesis about the power of the cross-sell, about the complement between the 2 services, has been completely confirmed. And I'm really excited to just focus on integration execution and delivering some good results in the coming quarters.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Wanted to ask about the ex-mortgage organic growth increase for the year. So you raised it by about 100 basis points. Could you just give some additional color on the main drivers there leading to sort of better expectation than what you were previously thinking of? Maybe just talk about sort of the -- which verticals are performing better than you originally thought. And maybe also if you think about Financial Services, you're expecting 20% ex-mortgage organic for the year. You have some difficult comps coming up next quarter, particularly. Just talk about the confidence in sort of what's changed and the ease of hitting those numbers.\nTodd Cello: Toni, this is Todd. I'll take your question, which is an important one for us to go through with you. So let me start first with Financial Services and just the confidence that we have in the updated guide on an organic basis ex the mortgage impact. So within there, first, this goes back to the previous question. The fintechs continue to be very strong for us. And in particular, just to highlight a little bit more on what Chris just said, we have seen some very strong marketing activity from the fintechs. So that -- the position that TransUnion has built in that space over the last several years is significantly benefiting us not only in the first quarter but also in our expectations for Q2 through Q4. In addition, smaller, but the BNPL players as I highlighted in my remarks at the beginning, they continue to be strong, and they're growing, and we're benefiting from that in the U.S., but we're also benefiting from -- in our International operations as well, as I said earlier. Also within Financial Services, again, on the customer acquisition side, the credit card marketers that we have stronger positions with, we find them to be significantly more aggressive on the marketing side. So that's definitely another driver for us and gives us the confidence there in Financial Services. The shift out of Financial Services, and think about the other areas that are driving growth for us, in the Emerging Verticals, Insurance, as I'm sure everyone can appreciate, that's a big vertical for TransUnion, and it continues to grow at a double-digit pace. The team just continues to drive innovation into the customer base to solve very sophisticated customer needs. So that's a big part of it. The Media vertical, we grew significantly based on the acquisitions that we had made back in 2020 to build out our capabilities. So not only is that business performing well, but then you couple that with Neustar and the marketing business there, that grew 10% or greater than 10% in the quarter. We feel really good about the position that we have built, in particular, in Media. And then the International portfolio is also where we have just a significant amount of conviction. And I think what I would highlight of most importance is where that growth is coming from. And it's coming predominantly from more emerging economies like India, Latin America, Asia Pacific. And even our African business posted very strong results, and we're expecting that to continue. So that's the -- that's what gives us the conviction in the overall guidance.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. The good news is it's very broad-based at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Just like you guys gave us kind of the mix and assumptions on the mortgage side, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how that would look if you looked at card and auto as well. And maybe just at a high level, too, I was hoping those 2 verticals specifically, like where are they versus pre-COVID levels today?\nChristopher Cartwright: Look, it's all about pre-COVID levels. And if you look at the piece parts of our Financial Services business, and again, U.S. focused here, very strong on consumer lending, which is a very material part of that group. Card, strong activity as well, and auto holding up well despite the frequently discussed supply chain issues. So again, overall, with the exception of mortgage, which we've all talked a lot about and understand what's going on there, performance is strong in Financial Services.\nManav Patnaik: I mean just curious, any sense of the assumptions you've made on those 2 categories for the year, just kind of like how you laid it out for mortgage?\nTodd Cello: Yes. Manav, I don't think we would have anything more to say than what I had said earlier. So I could reiterate that, I mean, it's -- in the card space, we continue to just see very aggressive marketing with the customers that we have strong relationships with. That's a meaningful driver for us there. And then in the auto space, what we're experiencing, and I said this earlier, just is there's demand, but the inventory issues that are holding things back. So we're still able to grow in that space. And a lot of it is, again, like what I highlighted is just the innovation that we brought to the market that we're able to differentiate ourselves as the sale of cars goes more digital today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: I just wanted to ask if you could expand on the addition of buy now, pay later data to consumer credit profiles. Just kind of interested in how much demand you're seeing from your client base for that information specifically. And any sense for where your BNPL data set sits relative to your competitors in terms of size and breadth and that sort of thing?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Sure. So let me just talk more generally about this. I mean it's an emerging area, and the industry is figuring out the best way to account for BNPL activity on the credit bureau files. Each of us have an approach to doing it. TransUnion is accumulating that information from our providers, and we're going to put it on a partition spot on the credit file as it is today, and our clients will have the ability if they choose to incorporate that data that signal into their lending models. It's important to note, though, that BNPL activity is different from a traditional credit trade line. These are fairly small dollar purchases, and they need to be consolidated in order -- they would need to be consolidated in order to appear as a trade line on the credit report. Now we can currently do that through partnership, but the industry is still working out the best way to accommodate it. I can't really comment on the relative size of the data that we're accumulating versus our competitors. I guess what I will say is that we feel like we compete very well in fintech, and BNPL is no different. So I imagine the size of our data repository is going to be attractive when lenders are ready to incorporate that signal. But you have to be judicious because the data is different than traditional trade lines, you can't just plug that into conventional credit models without kind of disrupting the results, right? So we think accumulating the data and creating data attributes based on it, that our clients can then incorporate it into their origination models and their marketing propensity models and the like. We think that's a very sound way to go about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: This is Mario Cortellacci on for Hamzah. I guess prior to the big 3 acquisitions you made, you commented on how much your portfolio is levered to the credit cycle. Could you just update us on your thoughts there? And then obviously, several times throughout the call, you mentioned how bullish you guys are on the consumer and the health of the consumer. I think you also commented a little about consumer -- about what your customer comments were, specifically from banks, but maybe you could also comment on what you're hearing from your customers internationally on the credit cycle.\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. So what I would say is in recent years, because of our innovation and our expansion into adjacencies and also just adding new capabilities, we've diversified our total revenues away considerably from direct correlation to origination activities. And that's the expansion into fraud mitigation services, analytic services, consumer -- direct-to-consumer and credit enablement as well as marketing, where we made substantial investments. The recent 3 acquisitions that you outlined, that just continues the diversification, but also, we're adding highly complementary capabilities to the mix. So TransUnion's portfolio today relative to where we were 5 years ago, certainly 10 years ago, during the last major downturn, it's been more than 10 years now, we're considerably more diversified, plus the international markets form a significant proportion of total revenues, and those have been very fast-growing and resilient in all circumstances except this recent pandemic, right? So we feel more diverse and pretty positive.\nMario Cortellacci: And on the customer comments just internationally on the credit cycle. \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. The customer commentary that I'm referring to, it's the way the banks were guiding the market during their recent earnings calls, right, in consumer lending, in particular, the health of the consumer is a strong area that they were citing, right? So I think our guide and our experience -- frankly, the numbers that we've delivered are consistent with that positive outlook. And I think it's much the same internationally. I mean we had a really strong performance in India, which has rebounded from a very difficult time with the pandemic and across Latin America and our businesses in Asia. The Philippines had some of the most severe lockdown that's reemerging. Our direct-to-consumer business in Hong Kong has also reestablished itself. So really looking around the portfolio globally, there's a lot of bright spots.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Chris, you talked a little bit about OneID platform being more powerful than initially anticipated. [Indiscernible] this ingest and tag data faster. Can you talk a little bit about how this being better than you expected, how should we think about this manifesting in terms of commercial potential? Should we see faster new product innovation? Is there a better ability to cross-sell? Can you just go through some specifics on how this being more powerful helps the company going forward on like a practical, on the ground level?\nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Good question. So obviously, the speed at which you can ingest data and your ability to fuse that data with other related elements and incorporate it into your data graphs and all of that, that reduces or rather it accelerates the product development cycle, speeds it up, helps you to get to market faster, helps you do more powerful kind of product engineering. So I see that as a benefit. But in addition, we have many compliance and regulatory demands to meet globally. And Neustar has a great ability to tag the data based on its source and permissible uses and the like, which will make it easier for us to comply with a continuously expanding realm of legislative and regulatory scrutiny if you look across the global markets in which we compete. Yes. And there's just a lot of intelligence that we can incorporate in that core OneID platform that we can kind of access centrally in a greater scale and make changes more quickly in the central repository that then flow out to all of the connected product offering, the product offering that we will connect increasingly over time as we integrate this business.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: You're seeing more potential commercially from what you saw beforehand. So we should think about that in terms of the context of the ability to come out with more innovation now.\nChristopher Cartwright: Well, look, I think we're going to quickly integrate TU's, and in many cases, TU's superior data sources into the OneID platform. I think much of that will occur over the course of this year, which is very quick. I can't tell you whether it's faster than it was previously. We always were very positive on the platform. But we're going to quickly integrate our best-in-class data interrelated with the data elements within the OneID platform, and that will improve the ability to resolve identity, and those benefits will flow through to all of the products that have created the OneID platform in terms of improving match rate, right? So look, I wouldn't push it too much further and say, oh, we're raising our growth expectations across the different products. Just think of it as an additional reason to feel confident in the numbers that we provided TheStreet and in the -- just in the inherent value of the technology that we acquired with Neustar.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Aaron Hoffman for any closing remarks.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We're going to wrap it up here. I know it's a busy day of earnings as usual, so we'll make sure everybody has time to transition over to other calls as we need to. So we hope you have a great day. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christopher Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Aaron, and let me add my welcome. To start, let me outline the agenda for this morning's call. First, I'll discuss the mostly positive macro conditions that support our attractive full year guidance despite inflationary headwinds, then I'll review our strong first quarter performance, which has been driven by favorable macro conditions and the resurgence of our growth-oriented portfolio post pandemic, the cumulative benefit of the strong sales performance over the pandemic and our successful innovations over time. I'm pleased to report that our outperformance year-to-date and confidence in the remainder of the year allow us to raise revenue and EBITDA guidance for the full year, and I'll provide an update on the impactful acquisitions that we've closed over the past 4 months. For Neustar and Sontiq in particular, we've experienced early successes in going to market together, with really encouraging interest from customers across a wide variety of end markets. And then I'll pass the baton to Todd to discuss our first quarter results in detail, along with second quarter and full year guidance for 2022. Now as I mentioned previously, we expect market conditions in 2022 to support our strong organic revenue guidance, along with the post-pandemic resurgence in our growth-oriented portfolio, especially in consumer lending, U.S. emerging verticals and the international markets. While a lot of the focus today is justifiably on rising inflation and the long-term impacts of this, I want to remind you that the U.S. consumer remains in a strong position with respect to credit markets. Household debt levels relative to income remain low by historical standards. Average credit card balances are well below prepandemic levels, and delinquency rates for most loans are near record low levels. Additionally, the unemployment rate in March fell to 3.6%, and wages grew by 5.6%. Despite increasing inflation, consumers remain well positioned to drive the economy. We heard as much from many large financial institutions this quarter who provided positive and pragmatic guidance during the recent earnings, noting the current strength in loan growth, spending activity and credit performance, but also acknowledging the potential uncertainty ahead. We continue to diligently monitor consumer health, particularly lower income households that have less ability to absorb rising costs. As the Fed seeks to curb inflation, rising interest rates have become an important corollary discussion. As such, I'll end this section by addressing the impact that interest rates have on our various lines of business. While rates certainly have an impact on the lending market, the overall health of the consumer, which I've just described, has greater influence on borrowing behavior and rates in most cases. Mortgage refinance represents the one part of the lending market almost entirely driven by interest rates. The simple math dictates whether or not it makes sense for a consumer to refinance a mortgage. And unsurprisingly, rates have some impact on purchase originations, though consumers don't shop based solely on rates. They shop based on a monthly payment where rates are one part of the calculation, along with the purchase price, the down payment and the long terms. For auto and card lending, rates have a very modest impact given the balances the average American carries. For instance, for every 0.25-point increase in rates, that translates into an increase in the monthly payment on the average card balance by only $1. So we tend to see far less impact from rising rates for these loan products. Now shifting to our first quarter. We posted strong results that exceeded our guidance, with broad-based growth across our businesses as our regions and verticals benefited from positive momentum buoyed by the healthy consumer as well as business wins and ongoing innovations. As Todd will discuss in detail, our first quarter outperformance and an improved view of our nonmortgage business for the remainder of the year has allowed us to raise our full year guidance. We did that while also embedding a more aggressive assumption around mortgage declines, implying broad and significant acceleration in our nonmortgage business. We continue to drive above-market performance by executing our growth playbook that focuses on repeatable, differentiated go-to-market approaches, industry-leading innovation and complementary expansion into adjacent markets. Our extension into high-growth and complementary credit fraud and marketing solutions continues to resonate with customers across our business while providing valuable diversification in our portfolio. In U.S. markets, we delivered another quarter of double-digit organic growth, excluding mortgage, with strong performance in Financial Services, Insurance and Media. This highlights our very strong position in fintech and other fast-growing market segments. Internationally, we experienced robust growth in India, Latin America and Asia Pacific, where we have leadership positions in these markets, and they have strong underlying growth trends. Todd will provide more details about the performance of each of these businesses shortly. And let me wrap up with a short summary on our ESG efforts. We recently published our 2021 diversity report, which highlights steady improvement in the diversification of our workforce across underrepresented groups. And last week, we published our 2021 sustainability report, which provides a broad picture of the progress we made last year, including issuing baseline carbon emissions data, setting a net-zero emissions goal, improving workforce diversity, further enhancing our cybersecurity and data privacy oversight, along with many other achievements. I hope you'll all take time to read these meaningful updates. Now I want to use the remainder of my time to share with you the performance of the 3 acquisitions that we've closed over the past 4 months. But before I do that, I want to highlight that the current market backdrop that I described a few minutes ago really accentuates the value of our recent acquisitions, particularly with Neustar and Verisk Financial Services. Now both of these can help lenders find attractive segments within the market and drive timely insights via the changing landscape. Now starting with Neustar. The acquisition substantially strengthens our identity resolution capability for a variety of online applications. Neustar provides real-time identity resolution through its OneID platform, powering solutions that currently serves 3 attractive markets: marketing, cloud mitigation and communications. In the first quarter, Neustar generated $150 million of revenue, up 9% in total, with another quarter of double-digit growth in marketing and at a margin of nearly 25%. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress integrating Neustar and have received some really encouraging feedback from the market and gained valuable learnings from customers that support the long-term growth thesis. Internally, we've completed our organizational design efforts quickly in order to provide clarity and ensure retention of critical employees. This has helped us retain nearly 100% of the top talent that we've identified thus far. I want to note the very high-caliber workforce that we've acquired with Neustar, and we benefit from quickly and efficiently expanding our talent in critical areas like technology, data science, product development and many others. In the current competitive environment, adding so many high-quality employees would have been extremely difficult. We've also brought together critical functions to fully benefit from our increased scale and capabilities. For instance, by standing up data and analytics as its own organization under the leadership of Venkat Achanta, we brought further clarity and purpose through a critical area of our business. Now Venkat has extensive experience in data and analytics, and most notably drove the development of Neustar's impressive OneID platform. Our internal teams have already benefited from collaborating with each other as part of one newly formed org and setting the stage to better leverage the powerful assets and capabilities of both companies. Now speaking of OneID. Through the integration process, we've learned the platform performs even better than we understood during our diligence, particularly the system's ability to rapidly ingest, index and tag data to prepare it for analytic and solution development and deployment is more advanced than we understood. This increases our ability to utilize data assets and put them into production rapidly. From a commercial standpoint, we've begun to integrate our sales teams, including extensive training to drive cross-selling activities across customers and solution types. Now let me share some of the early views and successes from the field. The more substantial and differentiated marketing solutions from Neustar, combined with our TruAudience offerings, have already opened the door to opportunities in our fast-growing Media vertical. Our teams have taken a coordinated approach to actively pursuing these opportunities and have early traction with key clients. In Financial Services, we secured our first cross-sell contract of Neustar solutions to a mid-tier lender, and we've had extremely high interest levels as we continue to meet with other customers. In the Insurance markets, Neustar currently provides its sophisticated solutions to 3 of the top underwriters in the U.S. Our combined teams recently met with one of the largest insurers and heard how impactful Neustar's marketing solutions have been for that customer as they spend billions of dollars on marketing each year, and they indicated that their return on their marketing investment has improved significantly as a result of the Neustar optimization solution. And given that TransUnion currently has relationships with 19 of the 20 -- the top 20 largest insurers in the U.S. and an array of other players, we think there's a sizable opportunity to bring the same type of marketing capabilities to the rest of our client base who also spend considerably on marketing and are consistently looking for ways to drive better returns. And in third-party collections, we signed our first cross-sell contract with an existing TransUnion customer who will now use Neustar's phone-based intelligence to identify the best time to call individuals to improve their hit rate on outbound collections calls. The now integrated sales team has attended major trade collection shows recently and discussed similar solutions with the almost 50 existing TransUnion new clients. And let me end by reminding you about the financial expectations for this business. In 2022, we expect Neustar to deliver another year of high single-digit organic revenue growth driven by strong performance in marketing and fraud. We expect the business to deliver low double-digit revenue growth beginning in '23 and beyond, and we're expecting roughly $160 million of adjusted EBITDA in '22, which would imply a 25% margin. Now supporting the improvement in 2022 and our path to deliver 40% margins by 2025, we have a clear line of sight to at least $70 million in cost synergies and have become increasingly confident as we've progressed through the integration process. In part, Neustar has begun its cost reduction program before we acquired them, and that included activities like consolidating 8 data centers and 2 colocation sites. At the same time, we are benefiting from working together. For instance, we're leveraging data sets across organizations to reduce costs related to the name, address, phone and e-mail data that we collect by millions of dollars. And we've also begun to consolidate office locations in Chicago and London, which will both happen this year. Now turning to Sontiq, which provides an entry point into the fast-growing ID protection market that's been driven by rapid e-commerce evolution. In this environment, consumers have heightened awareness of and a concern about the risks of identity theft. Sontiq allows us to access a considerably larger part of this market, fueling strong long-term growth. In the first quarter, Sontiq generated roughly $23 million in revenue, up approximately 13%, at a margin of roughly 33%, which was slightly depressed by integration costs. Also during the quarter, we began our integration activities and have seen meaningful opportunities materialize. Our teams are fully leveraging our global capabilities in areas such as operations and solutions, and expanding their go-to-market collaboration between our Consumer Interactive teams and their U.S. Market counterparts, especially in Financial Services and Insurance, but also across our international teams as well. For instance, we've positioned ourselves to bid on a sizable nonfinancial services contract in the identity protection space based on the addition of Sontiq's expansive solution suite, which we believe will be the first of many such opportunities. We're also off to an encouraging start selling Sontiq solutions to our network of insurance underwriters. Insurance represents about a quarter of Sontiq's revenue today, and we see a clear path to expand that position on the strength of our relationships in the space. We've identified similar opportunities across our U.S. Markets portfolio. Notably, in Financial Services, our customers are showing a strong interest in Sontiq's capabilities. And based on the existing momentum in the business and the ongoing integration, Sontiq is currently trending ahead of the plan, and we expect mid-teens revenue growth for 2022, excluding integration costs, at a nearly 40% margin. Now let me wrap up with the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services. We completed the transaction on April 8 and have decided to retain Argus and Commerce Signals, a marketing business, and to classify the remainder of the portfolio as discontinued operations with an intention to sell these assets. As a reminder, the business in total generated $143 million of revenue in 2021, with about $95 million coming from Argus and Commerce Signals. The decision to divest the noncore assets will focus our energy on enhancing the core Argus asset while also allowing the other business to benefit from new ownership. Argus brings differentiated card and deposit transaction data as well as the IP to link the personalized transaction data across sources to create a consumer level full wallet view. With this, we'll be able to deliver enhanced insight to action to measurable outcomes for Argus' consortium members. Argus increases TransUnion's thought leadership and insights, helping our customers develop more refined strategies to target profitable consumers or to identify sophisticated patterns of card fraud. We can help our customers take action on those insights with TransUnion solutions, whether they are traditional credit-based or noncredit-based through our Neustar capability. And we'll be able to do this through a unified platform powered by Prama and OneID. And we're happy to report that we're getting very positive feedback from the existing consortium members about our ownership and their desire for enhanced insights delivered using a modern technology-enabled platform. We've also heard from lenders who have not participated in the consortium, and many have expressed interest in joining in order to benefit from Argus' powerful data and insights. As we integrate Argus in 2022, we anticipate growth in the low single digits, though at a temporarily depressed margin as we absorb the necessary integration costs. In '23, we expect growth to improve to high single digits and then reach low double digits in 2024, with the margins expanding over this period as we trend toward our goal of 40% margins in 2026. Now that wraps up my update on our market backdrop, the first quarter performance and the integration of these 3 key acquisitions. Now I'll turn the time over to Todd to walk you through our first quarter financial results, our second quarter guidance and the full year guide as well. Todd? Thanks, Todd. Well, to conclude, TransUnion delivered another strong quarter while also quickly integrating strategic acquisitions that further position us for long-term differentiated growth. We raised our guidance despite meaningfully de-risking our outlook with more aggressive expectations for mortgage declines. This reflects the strength and diversity of our portfolio. We expect another very good year in 2022 driven by the continuation of constructive market conditions and the execution of our growth playbook. Yes. And so, Andrew, those are all the right details. And we have a lot of confidence that we're going to deliver the margins that we've outlined. We reconfirmed full year guide. You can see improving margins in the core. With regard to Neustar, we're ahead of the initial guide that we provided when we acquired the business. So we've got a lot of confidence that we're executing in a way that will deliver the margins we've guided to. Yes. And just to be clear, we're right on track with Verisk, right? This is exactly what we expected, right? And it is our typical approach to not add back. We just made an exception with Neustar because of the size of the deal. Yes. Sure. I'm happy to start this. Well, look, as we all know, the consumer in the U.S. overall, whether it be high income or lower income, is in very good shape. From a balance sheet perspective, consumers and households have delevered over the course of the pandemic. And at the lower end of the income spectrum, they were primary beneficiaries of that. There was a lot of forbearance of loan repayment during the pandemic as well as infusions of income from various government sources, right? On top of that, the employment market's incredibly robust. We're at 3.2% unemployment. There's almost 5 million jobs in the U.S. that are unfilled currently. Wages are increasing, ending in an abundance of employment opportunities. So we believe, and if you follow the banks as they reported their results earlier this season, they believe that the consumer is pretty well positioned. Now of course, there is the intermediate concern about rising inflation and the impact on consumers, particularly lower-income consumers, but there are offsetting factors like rising household income, high employment and relatively low credit card balances and leverage in general. So consumers have the ability to earn more and continue to consume, and there's still a lot of pent-up consumption coming out of the pandemic period, and they have the ability also to increase their leverage, right? So there's really a mix of issues that we think shades to the positive for 2022. Yes. I'd be happy to. So the short answer to your question is no, the fintechs don't believe there's going to be any slowdown. And if you look at our results in the U.S. where we grew over 20% in Financial Services in the first quarter, a lot of that is resurgence among fintech and disproportionate contribution from the BNPL sector where we also have nice share. But overall, the consumer is strong, and lending is increasing. And we're very optimistic about our Financial Services performance for the full year, independent of the deflation we've got in the mortgage market because of rising interest rates. And again, what I would remind you of, and we commented on this earlier in the pandemic, but our portfolio is largely growth-oriented. And we are attacking and taking share in many of the markets in which we compete. We've got a disproportionate share of the emerging fintech and BNPL markets. We've got an international portfolio that skews toward higher-growth economies with emerging middle classes and increasing borrowing rates. And then if you look in the U.S., the emerging markets division, we have kind of attacker positions in insurance, in public sector, in the investigative solutions realm. And we think as the economy has now firmly emerged from the pandemic period, we're going to return to that growthful trajectory that we've demonstrated through the years. Yes. Well, look, Neustar services some of those companies today. With the partnership now with TransUnion, there's an enormous opportunity to cross-sell back and forth. Not just Neustar coming into fintech, but truly, the cross-sell potential is very exciting. Having spent a good deal of time both in Neustar and in Sontiq, I think our investment thesis about the power of the cross-sell, about the complement between the 2 services, has been completely confirmed. And I'm really excited to just focus on integration execution and delivering some good results in the coming quarters. Yes. The good news is it's very broad-based at this point. Look, it's all about pre-COVID levels. And if you look at the piece parts of our Financial Services business, and again, U.S. focused here, very strong on consumer lending, which is a very material part of that group. Card, strong activity as well, and auto holding up well despite the frequently discussed supply chain issues. So again, overall, with the exception of mortgage, which we've all talked a lot about and understand what's going on there, performance is strong in Financial Services. Yes. Sure. So let me just talk more generally about this. I mean it's an emerging area, and the industry is figuring out the best way to account for BNPL activity on the credit bureau files. Each of us have an approach to doing it. TransUnion is accumulating that information from our providers, and we're going to put it on a partition spot on the credit file as it is today, and our clients will have the ability if they choose to incorporate that data that signal into their lending models.

But you have to be judicious because the data is different than traditional trade lines, you can't just plug that into conventional credit models without kind of disrupting the results, right? So we think accumulating the data and creating data attributes based on it, that our clients can then incorporate it into their origination models and their marketing propensity models and the like. We think that's a very sound way to go about it. Yes. So what I would say is in recent years, because of our innovation and our expansion into adjacencies and also just adding new capabilities, we've diversified our total revenues away considerably from direct correlation to origination activities.

The Philippines had some of the most severe lockdown that's reemerging. Our direct-to-consumer business in Hong Kong has also reestablished itself. So really looking around the portfolio globally, there's a lot of bright spots. Yes. Good question. So obviously, the speed at which you can ingest data and your ability to fuse that data with other related elements and incorporate it into your data graphs and all of that, that reduces or rather it accelerates the product development cycle, speeds it up, helps you to get to market faster, helps you do more powerful kind of product engineering.

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone this morning. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 32% on a reported and constant currency basis. Neustar and Sontiq added about 25 points to revenue, and organic constant currency growth was 8%. Excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2021 and 2022, our business grew 13% on an organic constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 10% of our revenue, and that is expected to fall to 7% for full year 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% on a reported and 21% on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, down 340 basis points compared with the year ago quarter driven primarily by the lower margin profile of Neustar. Excluding both the Neustar and Sontiq acquisitions, the margin would have been 38.8%. First quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 11% driven by adjusted EBITDA growth offset by higher interest expense and depreciation and amortization. Now looking at segment financial performance for the quarter. U.S. Markets revenue was up 42% compared to the year ago quarter. The Neustar acquisition had about 35 points of impact on revenue growth. Organic growth was 7% or 15%, excluding mortgage. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Markets increased 23% on an as reported and 2% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 580 basis points, with 380 basis points of the decline due to the acquisition of Neustar. Diving into the results by vertical. Please note that at this time, we have included Neustar's financial results within Emerging Verticals. As we evaluate our operating structure as a fully integrated business, we will provide you with any necessary updated financial information. Financial Services revenue grew 5% and was up 21%, excluding mortgage. Looking at the individual end markets. Consumer lending continues to be very strong, with considerable investor demand focused on thoughtful expansion, particularly as loan consolidation and personal loans for large purchases have become more mainstream. Our BNPL position also continues to grow on the strength of the market and share gains. Based on our discussions with many of the largest BNPL lenders, we are also confident that during 2022, we will enable them to furnish data. This will enrich our credit data for all lenders while promoting greater financial inclusion as consumers who utilize BNPL loans will get credit, no pun intended, for their activity. We also had another strong quarter in our credit card business as issuers pursued incremental share of wallet, continuing a trend of historically strong origination and marketing activity. We anticipate further good growth in 2022 as issuers remain focused on customer acquisition and portfolio review. Our auto business delivered solid growth in the quarter as new business wins and on-trend innovation, particularly related to digital retailing, helped offset well-publicized inventory issues for new and used cars even as consumer demand remains high. We're seeing traction with Auto Payment Shopper, a digital retailing platform that satisfies consumer desire for end-to-end online auto shopping. We're also seeing greater interest in CreditVision Link to better assess consumers and drive greater financial inclusion by utilizing powerful alternative data. And for mortgage, rates have moved to their highest level since 2018, which considerably shrinks the potential refinancing pool. On the purchase side, consumer demand remained solid but continues to be constrained by limited inventory, particularly in highly desirable locations and rising rates. At this time, we expect our mortgage business revenue to decline about 25% for full year 2022. We expect the mortgage market as measured by inquiries to be down 30%. We expect our business to perform slightly better than the market as a result of volumetric pricing increases that partially offset the volume declines. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 104% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the revenue associated with Neustar. Our Media vertical continues to deliver very strong double-digit growth and was up about 50% organically in the quarter as we signed new accounts and expanded existing relationships with a large media agency and several very large media companies focused on video and streaming platforms. The TruAudience marketplace, which was built from the TruOptik acquisition, continues to deliver substantial growth. Notably, these acquisitions don't reflect any of the anticipated upside from incorporating highly differentiated Neustar marketing capabilities, which we believe can drive further upside in the future. Insurance also delivered double-digit growth on the strength of key innovative solutions like DriverRisk, National Driving Record Solution, TLO-based investigative tools, continued traction in digital marketing enabled by the TruAudience platform and expanding opportunities in both the commercial and life markets. Public Sector delivered another good quarter driven by ongoing new business wins, particularly related to fraud mitigation. Tenant and employment screening remains strong as employment screening has accelerated with increased employment levels and tenant screening continues to perform well, though with moderation as movement has slowed due to the soaring rental prices and extended eviction moratoriums. Consumer Interactive, which includes Sontiq, revenue increased 15% on a reported basis and declined 3% organically as we were down in both the direct and indirect channels. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18%. Revenue was impacted by moderating consumer demand for paid credit-related solutions across both the indirect and direct channels, particularly with changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID. We expect this broad market theme to persist and for the segment revenue to be down slightly more in the second quarter than in the first quarter. This trend further strengthens the case or expanding into the identity protection market via the Sontiq acquisition as those subscriptions are more durable over time and are often provided to consumers by employers, insurers and others. For my comments about International, all comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 18% as we saw underlying market improvement in most of our regions. Adjusted EBITDA for International increased 18% as a result of the strong revenue growth. Let me dig into the specifics for each region. In the U.K., revenue increased 15%. We continue to benefit from a meaningful onetime government contract. Excluding that revenue, our U.K. business would have grown about 3% in the quarter as the mortgage and auto markets have been under pressure due to increasing rates and inventory constraints. This 3% growth rate was also impacted by comparability with some onetime revenue seen in Q1 2021, so underlying performance was high single digits. Also recall that the benefits of the government contract started in Q2 2021 and ramped through Q1 2022, so we expect reported growth to be impacted as we lap the contract starting next quarter. Most importantly, we expect underlying growth to remain healthy. So moving back to the quarterly performance in the U.K., we continue to see solid performance across our lending solutions, most notably in the fast-growing BNPL space. In fact, in February, we became the first U.K. bureau able to accept BNPL data into our credit files. Working closely with prominent BNPL providers, we can now incorporate this data into credit reports to support consumers that are using this type of point-of-sale finance while also ensuring lenders have a comprehensive picture of a borrower's financial position. We also continue to see strength in our gaming and gambling vertical, which is benefiting from our ability to employ open banking solutions to help online and physical casinos better determine a participant's capacity to bet. This solution helps the operator and the bettor set appropriate limits and is highly encouraged by regulators. Our Canadian business grew 1% in the first quarter, reflecting growth across the portfolio partially offset by a comparison to significant breach remediation business in the year ago quarter, which I have mentioned on the past several calls. Excluding the nonrecurring breach business, revenue would have grown 4%. We expect to see a similar breach impact in the second quarter and a less significant effect in the second half of the year. We continue to see strength across the business with improving demand and growing pipelines from both traditional and nontraditional lenders, setting us up well for stronger growth in the coming quarters. In India, we grew 37%, reflecting strong market trends, successful innovation and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Despite rising inflation, the Indian consumer remains healthy and continues to spend aggressively. This is helping to drive an expected GDP of 7%, along with 9% growth in the credit market in 2022, fueled by a resurgence in consumer lending and credit card issuance, along with the continued rise of fintech and BNPL players. We have outstanding positions across the entire lending spectrum, including with these players, allowing us to capture this meaningful market growth while also outperforming the underlying market. This outperformance is driven by our innovative approach to the market, strong relationships and continued diversification into the fast-growing businesses like commercial credit and direct-to-consumer. In Latin America, revenue was up 17%, with broad-based growth across our markets, including double-digit growth in our largest markets, Colombia and Brazil. This very strong growth reflects good macro and consumer fundamentals, along with ongoing new business wins and share shifts in Financial Services, and particularly with fintechs and neobanks, and continued strong uptake of CreditVision and fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 25% driven by continued good performance in Hong Kong and the start of recovery in the Philippines, which had been under lockdown longer than any of our other markets. Finally, Africa increased 9% on the continued strength of our Insurance and retail businesses as well as meaningful growth outside of our largest market, South Africa. We also continue to see additional adoption of CreditVision, TruValidate and our commercial credit solutions. We ended the quarter with roughly $6 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and pro forma leverage of 3.5x. Since quarter end, we have deployed $515 million of cash for the purchase of Verisk Financial Services and associated fees and also paid roughly $355 million in taxes associated with the sale of Healthcare. Factoring these payments, cash on the balance sheet would be closer to $400 million, in line with our more typical cash balances. Adding Verisk Financial Services to the equation but excluding those businesses classified as discontinued operations, we expect our pro forma leverage ratio to be approximately 3.9x in the second quarter as a result of deploying the cash held for taxes and purchasing Verisk Financial Services. However, we expect to delever to 3.6x by the end of 2022. We expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the noncore Verisk Financial Services business for general corporate purposes. Before turning to guidance, I'd like to quickly comment on free cash flow. You will notice our cash flow statement that first quarter 2022 cash from operations was lower than last year. This was primarily due to higher interest expense and increased usage of net working capital primarily related to higher incentive compensation. That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. All the guidance provided reflects the acquisition of Verisk Financial Services, though, notably, only Argus and related business called Commerce Signals as we are treating the noncore businesses as discontinued and intend to divest on. As a reminder, for 2021, Argus revenue was $95 million of the reported $143 million for Verisk Financial Services. The prorated amount contemplated in our 2022 guidance is $68 million based on the April 8 closing date. Starting on with the second quarter. We expect 1 point of headwind from FX on both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. And for revenue, we anticipate a 27-point benefit from the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. Revenue is expected to come in between $958 million and $968 million or a 32% to 33% increase on an as reported basis and 6% to 7% on an organic constant currency basis. Embedded in our revenue guidance is an approximately 4.5-point headwind from mortgage, meaning that the remainder of our business will grow 10.5% to 11.5% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $347 million to $353 million, an increase of 17% to 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline 440 to 400 basis points, primarily as a result of incorporating Neustar and Verisk Financial Services' relatively lower margins. On an organic basis, excluding the 3 acquisitions, margins are expected to decrease approximately 50 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.96 and $0.99, an increase of 8% to 11%. And for the full year, we expect immaterial FX impact to revenue, and we also expect about 24 points of benefit from M&A. Revenue is expected to be between $3.85 billion to $3.9 billion, up 30% to 32%. Our guidance includes 4 points of headwinds from mortgage for the full year. So full year revenue excluding mortgage on an organic constant currency basis is expected to increase 10% to 12%, a 100 basis point increase over the guidance that we provided during our February earnings call driven by the first quarter outperformance and our improving full year outlook. For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. Markets to be up mid-single digits, but up mid-teens, excluding mortgage. Financial Services is also expected to be up mid-single digits, but about 20% excluding mortgage. We expect Emerging Verticals to be up low double digits. We anticipate that International will grow low teens in constant currency terms, a slight increase over the previous guidance of low double digits, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits on an organic basis as a result of challenging prior year comparison. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $1.405 billion and $1.44 billion, up 21% to 24%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to compress 260 to 220 basis points this year driven by the lower-margin acquisitions and acquisition integration costs for Sontiq. Compared to prior guidance, the slightly greater margin decline is a result of adding the Argus business at a lower margin that is further compressed by integration costs. Without the Argus addition, margin would remain in the same range we provided previously, 36.9% to 37.4%. We also continue to expect the margin to expand about 40 basis points on an organic basis. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year is expected to be between $3.84 and $3.98, up 11% to 16%. The modest change in the top end of the range is most significantly a result of higher interest expense from rising LIBOR rates. A slight increase in our expected tax rate also impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share. Without these headwinds, adjusted earnings -- adjusted diluted earnings per share would be about $0.07 per share higher due to our increased adjusted EBITDA expectations. And to help you complete your modeling of 2022, at this time, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%, up slightly from 22.2%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million, and the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, is expected to be about $220 million, up from $215 million. We anticipate that net interest expense will be about $220 million, up from $205 million due to higher LIBOR and expectations of future LIBOR increases as implied by the forward curve. As a reminder, about 68% of our debt is fixed using hedge instruments, and 32% is floating. Let me spend a moment to recap our hedging philosophy. We want to ensure we leave sufficient room to prepay debt, which would lower leverage, decrease interest expense and therefore increase cash flow for other strategic purposes. We also want to avoid the potential of being overhedged, which would place TransUnion at speculative hedging position. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Andrew, this is Todd. I'll take that question. So as it pertains to our confidence in being able to expand margins beyond 2022, I think it's instructive is just to remember the growth drivers that we anticipate. First, we expect to continue to deliver very strong organic revenue growth, which has a very significant flow-through to the bottom line. So think about just the leading innovation that TransUnion has in many product categories. We're going to continue to deliver, and that will also -- that will bolster the bottom line. In addition to that, you have to then shift to the inorganic piece. So starting first just with the acquisitions of Neustar, Sontiq and now the recently-closed Verisk Financial Services acquisitions. Neustar and Verisk Financial Services currently carry a significantly lower margin profile than TransUnion, where Sontiq primarily does have a margin similar to TransUnion's, but right now, it's being weighed down by normal integration costs to make Sontiq part of the business as it continues to grow. But if you go back to Neustar, and as Chris talked about in his remarks, the business generated a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin. And we -- as that business continues to grow, which it did grow 9% in the quarter and we're expecting it to grow high single digits, there's a nice flow-through there, but don't forget also about the cost synergies that we committed to, which are $70 million, which we believe by the end of 2023, we will secure roughly about 80% or so of those synergies. So the team has been working very hard, as again Chris talked about, in being able to integrate the organization but also to find those cost savings. So we feel very confident about being able to deliver on that piece. And then Verisk Financial Services, which, as you've seen this morning, we have put in -- because of close on April 8, we put into our guide the businesses of Argus and Commerce Signals. And we will be divesting the remainder of the businesses. Right now, again, similar to Sontiq, those businesses are turning a lower margin, and it's primarily this year due to the integration expenses that I think you'd expect us to have to incur to make that business part of TransUnion. But again, importantly, again, as the future outlook for that business, as we begin to rank -- as it begins to be part of TransUnion and we're able to change the way we go to market with Argus as well as the way we deliver the product, that will have a significant impact on the profitability, and then the integration costs will eventually go away as well. Jeff, I'll take that one. And I think I'm hearing kind of a couple of different questions in there. I think you're asking, first, just about what happened with Argus and the expectations on margin, but then also you're asking about Q1. So why don't -- let me start with Q1 first and tell you just where we came in with margins. And so clearly, you can see that we did have a strong revenue performance, as you already indicated. We were $7 million higher than the high end of our guide on revenue, but adjusted EBITDA of $334 million was mid-range on the guide that we provided back in February. The drivers really kind of fall into 3 buckets for us, the first just simply being product mix. And with the increase in revenue, costs go up, but also that mix of revenue, there's some variable costs that drive that. So that's number one component. The second component primarily relates to compensation-related increases that we had within the quarter. I think there's some incentive comp. There's also some items that were just simply timing-related that we will capture later in the year. And then the third category was just the remediation efforts that we took pertaining to the data incident in South Africa. But I think what's most important to take away from the materials today is that, yes, margin was lower in Q1, but what we've committed to for the full year is to get the margin back to 37.4% before the Verisk Financial Services acquisition is included. So we're -- yes, Q1, expenses were a little bit higher, but we have -- we've managed that, within the updated guidance we've given, to be able to stay flat. If I flip over to your question pertaining to the Argus margin, lots of moving pieces. So I know most of the participants on this call are familiar with Verisk Financial Services and the financial profile, but -- and that's obviously everybody's starting point. But with us making the decision to hold the Argus and Commerce Signals only in -- to divest the other 4 businesses, there's a lot that move within those numbers. So that's kind of one thing. The second thing then, it is the M&A integration expense. We are not adding back, for our non-GAAP metrics, anything pertaining to the integration for Verisk Financial Services. We are for Neustar, right, just simply because of the time and the materiality. So -- and add Sontiq as well, too, just to clarify what we're doing. So Verisk gets burdened, and our integration efforts for Verisk, I'd say they're very aggressive. So meaning that there's a significant amount of spend that's contemplated in 2022 for that business. Toni, this is Todd. I'll take your question, which is an important one for us to go through with you. So let me start first with Financial Services and just the confidence that we have in the updated guide on an organic basis ex the mortgage impact. So within there, first, this goes back to the previous question. The fintechs continue to be very strong for us. And in particular, just to highlight a little bit more on what Chris just said, we have seen some very strong marketing activity from the fintechs. So that -- the position that TransUnion has built in that space over the last several years is significantly benefiting us not only in the first quarter but also in our expectations for Q2 through Q4. In addition, smaller, but the BNPL players as I highlighted in my remarks at the beginning, they continue to be strong, and they're growing, and we're benefiting from that in the U.S., but we're also benefiting from -- in our International operations as well, as I said earlier. Also within Financial Services, again, on the customer acquisition side, the credit card marketers that we have stronger positions with, we find them to be significantly more aggressive on the marketing side. So that's definitely another driver for us and gives us the confidence there in Financial Services. The shift out of Financial Services, and think about the other areas that are driving growth for us, in the Emerging Verticals, Insurance, as I'm sure everyone can appreciate, that's a big vertical for TransUnion, and it continues to grow at a double-digit pace. The team just continues to drive innovation into the customer base to solve very sophisticated customer needs. So that's a big part of it. The Media vertical, we grew significantly based on the acquisitions that we had made back in 2020 to build out our capabilities. So not only is that business performing well, but then you couple that with Neustar and the marketing business there, that grew 10% or greater than 10% in the quarter. We feel really good about the position that we have built, in particular, in Media. And then the International portfolio is also where we have just a significant amount of conviction. And I think what I would highlight of most importance is where that growth is coming from. And it's coming predominantly from more emerging economies like India, Latin America, Asia Pacific. And even our African business posted very strong results, and we're expecting that to continue. So that's the -- that's what gives us the conviction in the overall guidance. Yes. Manav, I don't think we would have anything more to say than what I had said earlier. So I could reiterate that, I mean, it's -- in the card space, we continue to just see very aggressive marketing with the customers that we have strong relationships with. That's a meaningful driver for us there. And then in the auto space, what we're experiencing, and I said this earlier, just is there's demand, but the inventory issues that are holding things back. So we're still able to grow in that space. And a lot of it is, again, like what I highlighted is just the innovation that we brought to the market that we're able to differentiate ourselves as the sale of cars goes more digital today."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning, and they can also be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings call and the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. Also in early January, we filed an amendment to our third quarter 2023 Form 10-Q, correcting an overstatement to the noncash goodwill impairment of our UK reporting unit. In today's earnings release, we have included information on a revision, primarily related to our cost of services and SG&A expenses. We plan to file our 2023 10-K by the end of the month. So with that out of the way, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda from the call this morning. First, I will provide the financial highlights for our fourth quarter 2023 results. Second, I will detail our 2024 strategic priorities to drive value across TU. And finally, Todd will detail our fourth quarter results along with our first quarter and full year 2024 guidance. In the fourth quarter, we exceeded our guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, with growth across all segments. U.S. markets grew 3% with Financial Services up 3% and Emerging Verticals at 2%. In Financial Services, lending and marketing activity remained consistent with the levels seen late in the third quarter with no further deterioration in volume. In Emerging Verticals, insurance improved to mid single-digit growth driven by new business wins. Services and Collections and Public Sector both grew double-digits. Neustar delivered 4% growth in the quarter, in line with our expectations and accretive to our U.S. markets growth. Communication remains a standout driven by trusted call solutions, which grew almost 50% in the quarter. In Marketing and Risk Solutions, our subscription base remains healthy and bookings in the second half of the year were strong, which offsets still soft transaction revenues. For the year, Neustar grew revenues by 5% and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin to 31%, up 1,000 basis points in our two years of ownership. Our International segment grew by 13% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of innovation, share gains and expansion into new adjacencies. India led with 30% revenue growth, while Canada, Asia-Pacific and Africa grew double-digits as well. In November, we launched the next phase of our transformation program, focused on growing our global capability center network and enhancing our technology capabilities. We expect this transformation to deliver significant operating expense savings and reduce capital expenditures by 2026, while accelerating innovation and enabling growth. I will share more detail on this program shortly. We prepaid another $25 million of debt during the quarter for a total of $250 million in 2023. We also completed refinancings in October and February that will reduce our annual interest expense by $8 million in 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, we delivered good results and achieved key transformation milestones despite a challenging environment for many of our geographies and end markets. Our performance highlights the resiliency of our business model the relevance of our innovations \u2013 innovative solutions and the benefits of our vertical product and geographic diversification. As we turn to 2024, and we believe three strategic priorities will create significant value for TransUnion and our shareholders. The first is to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. The second is to leverage Neustar's product and technology capabilities further. And the third is to execute the transformation initiatives that we announced in November. Let me spend a bit more time discussing each now. Now Todd will provide full financial guidance, but at a high level, we expect to deliver 3% to 5% revenue growth, 4% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth and 6% to 11% adjusted diluted EPS growth. We expect economic growth to moderate in 2024 and lending volumes to remain steady. Consumer finances in the U.S. remain healthy due to low unemployment and real wage growth. Inflation has moderated, and the Fed has indicated that interest rate cuts are likely in 2024 and beyond, although, the timing and magnitude remain uncertain. Rate reductions will benefit the most rate-sensitive lending products, particularly mortgage and to a lesser extent, auto and personal loans, and also reduce interest payments to already leveraged consumers. Although demand for credit remains healthy, lending standards are still cautious. Some lenders have faced pressure from deposit outflows, rising delinquencies and concerns over potentially increasing capital requirements. The largest banks echoed this caution during recent earnings expressing optimism for a soft landing, but forecasting modest loan growth. TransUnion maintained strong positions across customers of all sizes and has enjoyed share gains in each market segment over the last decade. In our international markets, the UK, Canada and many of our Latin American countries are also experiencing slowing economic trends, although we expect India to continue to outperform. We expect to deliver good results in this environment. We believe many of our financial services end markets are at or near their bottom. For 2024, we are assuming that economic conditions remain stable with steady, albeit slower lending volumes. Any benefits from potential interest rate cuts and their impact on lending or marketing activity represents upside to our assumptions. Several factors underpin our confidence. First, we expect to realize the benefits of a strong sales year in 2023 and expect further momentum in 2024. Despite subdued volumes across many of our verticals in 2023, our U.S. sales team did an excellent job winning new business, culminating in strong sales in the fourth quarter for both financial services and our diversified markets. Customer demand remains strong across our verticals and solutions. Second, our vertical orientation provides diversification and growth levers that are independent of the lending environment and interest rate moves. We expect improving growth in our largest U.S. emerging vertical insurance driven by new business wins and customers slowly restoring marketing spend. We have also meaningfully expanded the breadth and depth of our product portfolio. We continue to enhance our value proposition and core credit and to launch new fraud, marketing solutions which combine TransUnion and Neustar strengths and Trusted Call Solutions is scaling rapidly with the potential for expansion internationally. Third, we expect strong revenue growth from international, which has grown revenues organically by double digits every year since our 2015 IPO except for in 2020 due to COVID. India is our largest international market and grew revenues to almost $220 million in 2023, up over 30% and contributing roughly 1.5 points to total company growth. We have grown more than 30% in India every year since 2017 with the exception of 2020, we expect all geographies to contribute to growth in 2024. And finally, this year, we expect to benefit from typical pricing actions both our own and third parties. We also remain highly focused on increasing profitability by driving savings from our transformation program and acquisition synergies in addition to prudent cost management. Now, key to our growth strategy is continuing to integrate Neustar successfully. Over the last two years, Neustar has been accretive to our U.S. markets growth rate and has scaled its standalone margins significantly. In 2024, we expect Neustar to grow revenue by mid-single digits. Our guidance assumes strong subscription revenue growth from our 2023 bookings and continued bookings momentum in 2024, but for soft volumes to persist in the more transactional parts of the business, which account for 20% of Neustar\u2019s revenue. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin at Neustar to be roughly 32% in 2024. We are allocating investment dollars to scaling fast growing and high potential products like Trusted Call Solutions and our identity-based marketing offerings, two of the most exciting opportunities across TransUnion. For this reason, we look at margin progress at U.S. markets as the more relevant statistic. We continue to deliver cost synergies and as of the end of 2023, we achieved our $80 million plus run rate target, already above the $70 million referenced at the time of acquisition. This does not include the benefits of material technology savings from our transformation program, which is enabled and accelerated by Neustar\u2019s state-of-the-art data and analytics platform, now called OneTru. We continue to achieve key milestones that can accelerate growth at Neustar and across TransUnion in 2024 and beyond. Now, we expect Communications Solutions to grow on the strength of Trusted Call Solutions or TCS. Since its launch in 2018, TCS has scaled to $80 million in 2023, up $30 million or 60% over the prior year. We expect the business to grow over 40% in 2024. TCS is revolutionizing inbound and outbound voice calling for our customers, improving answering rates, reducing fraud and increasing efficiency. Demand remains robust and we continue to win new customers across every vertical. Additionally, we\u2019re rolling out highly requested enhancements, including displaying logos for business calls to consumers, which recently launched with AT&A and blocking spoof calls before they reach consumers. TCS is already a needle mover for U.S. markets and total company growth rates, and we see a clear right to win in what we believe could be a $1 billion addressable market in the U.S. over the longer-term. We also see broad application across several geographies and will soon be announcing our next international launch in one of TransUnion\u2019s largest markets. In marketing, we integrated 22 additional TU and Neustar data assets into our new unified identity graph. Our entire marketing suite is now utilizing this unified graph that incorporates our best data. It enhances the depth, breadth and accuracy of consumer data across offline and online customer channels. With a newly improved identity graph, we cover 98% of the U.S. adult population with 700 plus demographic attributes and are seeing a 20%-plus increase in marketable phone numbers and e-mails and 50%-plus increase in targetable addresses. This identity centric approach is resonating with customers, particularly as they contend with the reality of third-party cookie deprecation, which Google is starting limited test of cookie restrictions. We\u2019re well-positioned to serve our customers during this transition, differentiating with our highly authoritative first party identity data as well as direct integration into walled gardens and publishers with privacy enhancing technologies such as clean rooms and partnerships with cloud marketplaces such as Snowflake, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud. In Risk Solutions, we expect accelerating growth driven by strong bookings of our contact center products in the second half of 2023. We\u2019re consolidating Neustar\u2019s risk capabilities onto TruValidate to deliver omni-channel fraud mitigation and have invested incrementally in go-to-market capacity. Our third strategic focus area for 2024 is executing our ongoing transformation initiatives. Since I became CEO in 2019, we have invested in global platforms across our product, operations, technology and data and analytics teams to build scale, foster knowledge sharing and develop standardized way of operating across the world. These initiatives accelerate innovation, streamline workflows, reduce costs and create better user experiences for customers and consumers. In November, we announced the next step of our transformation, comprising two complementary programs. First, we will build upon our strategy of leveraging our global capability centers across the globe, driving workforce productivity and allowing us to provide more services from talent rich geographies like India, South Africa and Costa Rica. We grew our GCCs from 400 employees in 2019 to over 4,000 in 2023 and expect to transition over 1,000 additional roles over the next two years. We are balancing the need for customer centric work in market with the opportunity to centralize and standardize key global functions. Second, we will enhance our technology capabilities by completing our project rise cloud migration and leveraging Neustar\u2019s technology to consolidate our product and innovation enablement onto a common state-of-the-art platform, OneTru. We expect this transformation to drive material revenue and cost benefits. By 2026, we expect to deliver $120 million to $140 million of annual operating expense savings with half of that realized in 2024. We also expect to reduce our CapEx spend from the historical 8% of revenue to 6% by 2026, The equivalent of $70 million to $80 million in annual cash savings. Now to achieve these savings, we expect to incur $355 million to $375 million of one-time costs. This is inclusive of $65 million already communicated for Project Rise. In simple terms, we expect to deliver roughly $200 million of ongoing annual free cash flow benefit for $300 million of incremental one-time costs. Just as importantly, these investments, particularly OneTru will accelerate our innovation rates. OneTru will enable our growth strategy of extending further into marketing and fraud solutions. These two fast growing markets are highly synergistic with our core credit markets. Put simply, we're not a Credit Bureau attempting to play in the identity space, we are a consumer identity bureau applying these capabilities to credit data along with marketing and fraud solutions to serve our customers. We believe that the complementary nature of credit, marketing and fraud will fuel growth across all three markets. OneTru will become the destination platform for activating our data assets in a single integrated technology stack across all global TransUnion product families, from data ingestion, data management and identity resolution to analytics and delivery. The platform is built on top of a foundational hybrid cloud infrastructure developed through Project Rise and leverages Neustar\u2019s architecture. OneTru is already live and powering TransUnion products and the next two years are about enhancing capabilities and consolidating more products, data and analytics onto the platform. We believe that OneTru will improve our data quality, speed our time to market and accelerate innovation. From a cost perspective, OneTru will also save costs, enabling us to rationalize applications and standardize services. These efficiencies will allow our engineers to spend more time focused on innovation. This standardized operating model will also ensure a compliance and privacy first approach using embedded security guardrails. The OneTru platform is increasing our pace of innovation and enabling the next generation of products. Let me highlight a few examples. In our TruIQ analytics suite, we leverage OneTru to improve the quality of our analytics services by reducing the time to insights and actions. In the past, we've discussed our TruIQ Innovation Labs, where our scientists collaborate with customers in multi-day hands on sessions, infusing our data, analytics and domain expertise to solve their business problems. Last year, we ran a host of these labs on the OneTru platform, clients benefited from real time interaction with our data and analytics for faster model development and deployment. The feedback has been very positive. By integrating our products on this common platform, we'll be able to serve clients\u2019 needs across multiple and previously siloed domains and convert our engagement seamlessly into ongoing revenues. We also recently launched TruIQ Data Enrichment, which provides instant access to TU data from within the customer's technology environment. This privacy first approach to data enrichment eliminates the need for sensitive client IP to leave their control. The solution streamlines access to credit and marketing data and accelerates model development. Advanced Acquisitions is a new offering that combines Data Enrichment with our credit and marketing capabilities for an integrated credit based pre-screen solution. Advanced Acquisitions powers a full range of consumer acquisition tools including self service, batch pre-screens, acquisition campaign, model development and deployment, and marketing audience definition, build and activation. TransUnion\u2019s media planning and measurement tools are also available on the OneTru platform to ensure effective marketing spend. We're also consolidating our fraud mitigation products globally onto OneTru in an integrated suite called TruValidate. TruValidate combines our comprehensive identity data along with fraud signals from a range of Neustar and TU products in a single platform where we apply advanced analytics fueled by machine learning and AI to extract deep insights. Our result or rather the result has been a substantial improvement in fraud detection and a reduction in false positives. We're currently beta testing our first release and expect the full rollout this summer. Our fraud product suite serves thousands of customers around the world and represents roughly $300 million of revenues against a multibillion dollar addressable market. We see substantial opportunity to gain share by offering a high performance integrated suite of solutions amplified by best-in-class analytics, which we believe will outperform the patchwork of point solutions that many customers use today. And finally, we're creating new and innovative marketing solutions in addition to the ongoing enhancements to our identity capabilities. TruAudience data collaborations, which we formerly called clean rooms, is a next generation offering to enable data collaboration between parties that don't want to directly exchange data, but must connect to partners across the advertising ecosystem. It's currently in market, in beta testing and will fully launch later this year. Client feedback is enthusiastic and we're working with the walled gardens to drive adoption. I look forward to providing you updates on these product advancements in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, who'll provide further details on our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and a less than 1% benefit from foreign currency. Our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2%, ahead of our expectations but down 140 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter due to lower U.S. financial services volumes, which have high margin flow through. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 2%, adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4% in the quarter and 22% for the full year, below our 23% guidance due to successful tax planning efforts. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we took $78 million in one-time charges related to the next phase of our transformation. The first expenses and what we expect to be a $355 million to $375 million program, inclusive of the final year of Project Rise. These fourth quarter charges were primarily related to employee separation with a modest amount related to office closures. I will provide more color on expectations for charges in 2024 during the guidance section. Before I get into U.S. markets, a reminder that we report Neustar revenue within our vertical market structure. As we\u2019ve stated previously, starting in 2024, we will stop providing standalone Neustar quarterly revenue growth rates and adjusted EBITDA margins. We will, however, provide updates on how we are progressing to our full year targets to achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2024. Looking at segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was flat and adjusted EBITDA margin was down 80 basis points to 33.2%. Financial services revenue grew 3% with activity broadly consistent with the levels seen late in the third quarter. Consumer lending revenue declined 3%. Online activity remains soft, but batch marketing has seen some modest improvement among our fintech customers, a sign that players are cautiously anticipating growth. Our credit card and banking business was down 5%, while issuance is healthy on a historical basis, online and batch activity remains tempered as lenders contend with credit normalization, deposit pressures and potential capital constraints. We are seeing stronger activity from our largest customers compared to a more conservative approach by midmarket and smaller institutions. We continue to retain and win share across our customers with momentum in fraud and identity solutions. Our auto business grew \u2013 delivered 1% growth on top of 16% growth in the prior year quarter. New car sales in the U.S. totaled $15.5 million in 2023, up 12% but still below the roughly $17 million of annual sales seen from 2015 to 2019. Sales are expected to increase modestly in 2024. The higher level of new car sales will still take time to replenish the used car market, which saw declining sales in 2023 and continues to face availability and affordability challenges. Used car prices were down in 2023 but are still 30% above pre-pandemic levels. The used car market currently accounts for almost 60% of financed vehicles in the U.S. For mortgage, revenue was up 34% in the quarter against inquiry volume declines of 11%. The pace of volume declines slowed throughout the year, but for the year applications were over 50% below 2019 levels and existing home sales were the weakest since 1995. Average mortgage rates after topping 8% in late October have fallen to 6.5% to 7% range. Rates remain high on a recent historical basis, which combined with elevated home prices and low inventory, will likely limit activity. On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 7% of total TransUnion revenue. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 2% in the quarter. Insurance delivered mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter and 4% for full year 2023 with trends stable and in line with expectations in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect to deliver improving growth with momentum as the year progresses. After two years of contracting marketing activity, we expect carriers to slowly restore marketing spend as rate adequacy improves and while consumer shopping activity remains robust. We continue to deliver significant new business wins across our core products as well as with innovative products like TruVision driving history and successful cross selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tech, retail and e-commerce and telco both grew low single digits. Tech, retail and e-commerce benefited from trusted call solutions wins and good, fraud and identity volumes from e-commerce customers, while caller ID drove growth in telco. Media was flat as usage based volumes for our audience solutions remained soft. Across our other emerging verticals, Services and Collections and Public sector both grew double digits, powered by strong growth in trusted call solutions and an employment screening declined as we work through the recalibration of our solutions. We are working to provide the most customer and consumer friendly approach possible and we believe it will create a long-term competitive advantage, particularly as regulators push for more consistent and compliant data usage across vendors. Consumer interactive revenue increased 7%, benefiting from a large breach win. We continue to grow our breach business largely on the strength of the Sontiq offerings. Breach revenues can be uneven, but are increasingly the byproduct of proactively selling recurring cyber protection programs to companies through cyber insurance providers. Breach response engagements also provide new engagements with consumers with opportunities to cross sell them into credit education and identity protection programs. Excluding the large breach win, revenue would have declined 2% in line with our expectations and the current run rate of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 45.5%, down 580 basis points due primarily to the impact of the breach win. Our direct business continues to decline as we recalibrated our marketing approach to focus on higher-value consumers. So far, we've seen good returns on the revamped approach. We continue to work to improve our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in this business. Our indirect business grew led by Sontiq, which grew double digits in the fourth quarter and over 20% for the full year. In addition to stronger-than-expected breach revenue, Sontiq's identity protection business grew double digits. For our traditional credit education products, performance across customers varied based on the idiosyncratic market dynamics. Lenders continue to be selective in utilizing offer aggregators and other channels for marketing. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 13% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%, up 20 basis points. Now, let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 30%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. We continue to win share in core consumer credit with an expanding suite of credit-oriented solutions as well as increased penetration of small and medium lenders. This strong core performance is complemented by a meaningful growth across commercial, credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer offerings. We now generate over a third of our India revenue outside of consumer credit, a testament to the success of taking our growth playbook to the Indian market. We expect another very strong year from India in 2024. In the UK, revenue was flat. The UK fintech market remains challenged, but we continue to see good growth in banking and insurance as well as share gains and wins with products like TruVision, trended data and our consumer offerings. Our Canadian business grew 14% despite a tepid macro environment, substantially outperforming flat to slightly declining lending market growth. We benefited from share gains in financial services, strong growth in telco and insurance and continued momentum in direct-to-consumer, including recent breach wins. Material portion of the outsized growth in Canada in 2023 came from sizable share wins, which will be fully annualized in 2024. For 2024, we expect healthy mid-single-digit growth in continued market outperformance. In Latin America, revenue was up 5%, and Brazil was down in the quarter due to weakness in the fintech market. In Colombia and our other Latin American countries, we delivered good growth across online and batch despite softening market conditions with wins across financial services, government and insurance. In Asia Pacific, we grew 13%, led by very strong growth in the Philippines, where we see attractive market growth and increased customer penetration. Hong Kong also had another solid quarter. Finally, Africa increased 11% based on a broadly strong performance despite a challenging environment in several of our largest markets. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.3 billion of debt after prepaying $25 million in the quarter for a total of $250 million in 2023. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.5 billion of debt. That left us with $480 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.6 times. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. In addition to extending our maturities from 2024 to 2028, we expanded our revolver from $300 million to $600 million, and our Term Loan A from $1 billion to $1.3 billion. We used the incremental $300 million raised for our Term Loan A to prepay $300 million of our higher coupon Term Loan B-6. Last week, we repriced our Term Loan B-6, reducing our credit spread by 25 basis points and removing the credit spread adjustment. The combined impact of these two refinancings results in roughly $8 million of annual interest expense savings. Net of our swaps, our average effective cost of debt at today's SOFR rate is roughly 5%. You can find our updated debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. We continue to focus on the integration of our recent acquisitions and have no intention to make large-scale acquisitions this year. Our priority is to prepay debt in 2024 with our excess cash flow. However, we expect prepayments to be lower than 2023 due to the onetime cash payments related to our transformation program. Cash outlays related to our fourth quarter cost initiative actions were minimal, and we expect most of our $355 million to $375 million of onetime expenses to be paid out in 2024. Based on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low three time range by the end of 2024. We continue to work toward our leverage ratio target of under three times. We do not view three times as an ending point for deleveraging and view debt prepayments as the best incremental use of our cash over the medium term. Turning to guidance, I wanted to first explain our philosophy for 2024. When we provided fourth quarter 2023 guidance in October, we were deliberately very conservative following a challenging third quarter. Our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024 reflects more typical TransUnion conservatism. We are assuming the current slower conditions persist throughout the year. Should interest rate cuts occur, and drive increased lending and marketing activity that would represent upside to our current guidance. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect FX to have an insignificant impact on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $971 million and $980 million or up 3% to 4% on an as-reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately one point of tailwind from mortgage meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be up 2% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $324 million and $331 million, up 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.4% to 33.8% or down 50 to 90 basis points. Margins are expected to be down sequentially and year-over-year due to the timing of expenses in international, particularly India as well as Consumer Interactive. We expect year-over-year margin expansion in our U.S. markets business in the first quarter. We expect the first quarter to be our lowest margin quarter with margins expanding each quarter as transformation savings build throughout the year. We also expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.79 and $0.81 a range of down 2% to up 1%. Turning to the full year. We expect insignificant impact from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $3.96 billion and $4.02 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as-reported and organic constant currency basis and up about 1.5% to 3.5%, excluding the impact of mortgage. For 2024, we expect mortgage inquiries to be down roughly 5% and our revenues to increase roughly 25%, primarily due to the impact of third-party scores pricing. We expect inquiries to be down roughly 15% in the first half of the year and up roughly 10% in the second half of the year as comparisons ease. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or low single digit, excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up mid-single digits or up low single digits, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digits. We anticipate that international will grow high single digits in constant currency terms, driven by the same positive trends that we saw throughout 2023. And we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.398 billion and $1.441 billion, up 4% to 7%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.3% to 35.8% or up 25 to 75 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.57 to $3.74, up 6% to 11%. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $245 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $245 million for the full year, down over $20 million year-over-year, primarily due to our 2023 debt prepayments, recent refinancings and lower SOFR. We expect to take an incremental roughly $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. Combined with $78 million of charges in the fourth quarter, we expect a total of roughly $280 million spent through 2024 compared to $355 million to $375 million of total program costs, which are expected to be completed in 2025. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue. I want to wrap up with some additional detail about our expectations for adjusted EBITDA in 2024. A key driver of adjusted EBITDA growth is flow-through from higher revenue inclusive of continued investment in the business. Based on the high end of our guidance, we expect to grow revenues by roughly $190 million and adjusted EBITDA by $65 million. While we are adding absolute adjusted EBITDA dollars, the lower than typical incremental margin is due to mix of revenue growth outside of core credit as well as targeted investments, primarily to support the strong growth in our International segment. When lending activity picks up, we expect to see strong incremental margins. Second positive is savings from our transformation program, which we expect to deliver roughly $65 million in benefit, in line with our commitment in November. We expect the savings benefit to build throughout the year. We also expect $20 million to $25 million of benefit from continued Neustar acquisition synergies and as well as reduced Sontiq in Argus integration costs in 2024. Partially offsetting these positives is resetting our annual incentive compensation costs to target after a below-target payout in 2023 in addition to annual merit increases. Taken together, we expect a good year for adjusted EBITDA growth with expected additional transformation savings still to come and further upside if we see any step-up in credit volumes. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we exceeded fourth quarter expectations, driven by stable lending and marketing conditions in the U.S. and robust growth from international. We expect a strong year in 2024 with mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. We're focused on three strategic priorities for the year to create value for TU accelerating revenue and earnings growth, leveraging Neustar's product and technology capabilities further and executing on our transformation initiatives. Finally, on a personal note, as many of you know, Aaron Hoffman has decided to retire from TransUnion in March. Aaron has been instrumental in building out the Investor Relations function at TU and has been a valuable resource to our management team and to investors alike. We've been lucky to have him over these last eight years, and we wish him a happy retirement. We're also excited to have Greg Bardi, who has been working with Aaron in these last three years and covered TransUnion on the sell-side before that. Leading our Investor Relations going forward. Now let me turn the time over to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris, and thanks for those kind words. I appreciate that very much. So that does conclude the prepared remarks today. And for the Q&A, as always, we ask that you ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And operator, we can begin the Q&A now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes to Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. \nSteven Pawlak: Yes, thank you. This is Steven Pawlak on for Jeff. I guess what do you need to see or what are your clients said if they need to see in order for Neustar transactional revenue to improve or bounce back?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Good morning, Jeff. I think I'll start answering that, Steven. Yes, so on the Neustar front, the headwind to hitting our growth targets there beyond mid-single digits has been the decline in the transactional components of the portfolio. In a more difficult economic environment, marketing and advertising activity has pulled back. In addition to the volume slowdown, we've seen with clients working to reduce data costs, right, and relying more on first-party data. So both of those have been headwinds to our sales. We've compensated a bit for the cutback on the data side by selling more first-party record hygiene and identity resolution services. So really, what we need is, I think, a stable floor in those areas and perhaps some rebound in activity. The guidance that we provide at Neustar is consistent with our overall guidance this period. It's intended to be conservative, yet constructive we're pushing to exceed that guidance and we hope we'll be able to do over the course of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Steinerman: Hi Chris, could you jump into the Consumer Interactive guide for 2024? Just maybe expand on what your expectations are more than just the numbers. And then inside the numbers, what are you assuming in terms of indirect growth for Consumer Interactive and when do you expect direct to return to growth?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. So obviously, Andrew, we have been navigating a pivot in the consumer business over the past 18 months or so. Part of that is the direct business, which has been in decline in part because of market demand shifting more towards premium, but also some adjustments in our marketing practices. That area has been the most pronounced decliner. Where we're at now is we can see it getting to kind of a neutral state over the course of the year, sometime probably mid-second quarter, a combination of reaching an equilibrium on our marketing practices and enjoying the benefits of the annual price increase and the like. We expect indirect to remain kind of a low single-digit grower over the course of the year. And of course, breach protection and identity protection through our Neustar acquisition \u2013 I'm sorry, through our Sontiq acquisition is doing particularly well. It grew over 20% last year, had a really strong fourth quarter. Again, think of the consumer guide in total in the context of an overall conservative corporate guide, right, where we're steering more towards the high end of things. And look, I think its important just to emphasize in the big with regard to TU in the consumer space is that, we believe we will return this business back to consistent positive organic growth. And we intend to compete across the full dimension of opportunities, whether that be identity protection, freemium offering, and the like.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask about U.S. Financial Services and the growth that you were assuming there for 2024. Just give us some color around how we should think about auto card, consumer lending. And we didn\u2019t touch on Argus. So curious what your expectations are there? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Sure. So in U.S. Financial Services, I mean, look, as we know, there was a year of turmoil in 2023, not only were we dealing with the impact of inflation and much higher interest rate, which slowed demand. But we're also dealing with deposit outflows from certain segments in banking because of the instability that we experienced in the second quarter. That led to a material slowdown in September of last year. We modeled a continuation of that slowdown in the fourth quarter, in fact, a deterioration from that rate. It turned out that, that was a bit conservative, and we overperform that, as you can see. Turning to 2024, we think we're at or near a floor in most of these services, but we're not assuming any improvement, right. So we kind of budgeted for steady volume across the different subcategories of financial services in the U.S. over the course of the year. Now growth rates are going to improve in the second half because comparables are easier in the second half. And of course, by the second half, we're getting the full benefit of price actions of both our own and third parties. But it's kind of a steady sailing forecast, if you will. We're not building in any uplift from the potential for interest rate reductions by the Fed.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thank you. I was hoping you could talk about your expectations for the fintech environment through 2024. I know you talked about some modest improvement in batch that you're seeing, but still challenges in the UK. So just hoping to get a little more color on where you see fintech in particular go from here? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Well, last year was an especially difficult one for fintech, largely because of the increase in borrowing costs and the difficulty of getting funding. And I think also some concerns about the health of the consumer from the third quarter forward. We saw a pretty material reduction here in the U.S. That segment probably fell roughly 20% last year. Again, our assumptions for 2024 are more or less steady from the volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. we're encouraged by the stability that we're seeing. And we're encouraged by an uptick in some batch activity which suggests that there will be more marketing activity in this space, but we haven't modeled too much of that optimism into the guide.\nTodd Cello: And just to add on to that, Toni, just to provide some sizing for fintech. We talked about in 2022 that we did about $175 million last year in the U.S., we\u2019re talking about and \u2013 we brought it \u2013 last year, we saw it come down to $140 million. So that\u2019s the 20% that Chris is referring to. Reason for bringing that out is TransUnion has a very nice position with fintechs that we\u2019ve spoken about, and our team\u2019s done a great job building those relationships. And in the whole scheme of our revenue, it\u2019s less than 4% of the overall company\u2019s revenue. So just wanted to make certain that was appropriately sized in response to your question. We see tremendous opportunity though, for us, as we believe that those customers are on a path to growing again and we\u2019re best positioned to take advantage of that.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And you also mentioned the UK, I mean, clearly it was even more difficult year. Today, you had a number of players that exited the market, that impacted our overall fed in the UK. We\u2019re continuing to \u2013 high-single digit growth\u2026\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Company. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of your peers has highlighted headwinds to their mortgage prequalification revenues in 2024 because soft polls are getting really expensive. I was wondering if you\u2019re expecting similar headwinds in that space in 2024 and how big prequalification revenues would be for mortgage for TransUnion?\nChris Cartwright: Hey. So Kelsey, I think I followed the question. We had a little bit of a technical glitch here, but I think you\u2019re talking about mortgage headwinds due to a rollout of the single bureau prequalification that the FHFA has sponsored. We have modeled that into our assumptions. So it is baked into the guide that we have provided. We expect that it will cause some volume deterioration, but again, that\u2019s factored into. Well, that\u2019s just one factor in our process of estimating where we think mortgage volumes will be. So we look at all of the publicly available information, we talk to our client advisory board. We\u2019ve got the historical trajectory of this, and then we have made some adjustments for an industry-wide adoption of a single bureau pull at prequalification.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to focus down or drilldown further on the emerging verticals. You mentioned the win in insurance and pretty good momentum there. But how should we think about the puts and takes? And for the rest of the emerging verticals, can you talk about some puts and takes in 2024. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Sure. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Hey Ashish, I\u2019ll take that one from you. So the \u2013 I think the heart of your question really comes down to the guidance that we provided for the emerging verticals and that we\u2019re assuming to be low-single digits. And really the way to think about that, the way we look at it is we break the emerging verticals into different segments. And you alluded to already insurance. We're expecting insurance to have a good year in 2024. The team has signed many new clients, so there's significant new business wins that will come to fruition in the year. As we spoke about in our prepared remarks, marketing is improving slowly. So we're cautiously optimistic about that. And shopping activity remains strong. So all in all, insurance, we're expecting a good year, probably in the mid-single-digits of growth. Also in the emerging verticals, we're expecting good growth in services and collections as well as in our public sector verticals. And a lot of that growth is coming from trusted call solutions, where we've seen significant, meaningful growth. And obviously that's the capability that came with Neustar acquisition.  So those three verticals of insurance, services and collections, and public sector represent about 40% of the emergency \u2013 revenue. So that means the other 60% to talk about expecting good growth out of those three. So in that other 60% [Audio Dip] business, here, as you're well aware to recalibrate due to a consent order that signed with the CFPB, [Audio Dip] opted our product to provide [Audio Dip] reports that we provide [Audio Dip] space. But it's going to take us a little bit of time in that, we probably more, maybe in the second half of the year [Audio Dip] get back to the growth expectations. Second thing that is [Audio Dip] communication. The communication vertical is where much of use are [Audio Dip] capabilities, for example. So think of caller ID TransUnion now provides [Audio Dip] That's kind of a flattish business. And it's also a bigger, so needless to say that [Audio Dip] to the growth rate then also the media vertical has tempered expectations for us in 2024 [Audio Dip] what Chris spoke about earlier with the generation [Audio Dip] volume dependent. So if there's a recovery coming on the market side, that would be something that would benefit. I highlight those three, because those are the three where our expectations are a little bit and consistent with the guidance that we've provided for the year. This is just where we're being prudent [Audio Dip] provide guide here that's overly take it one quarter at a time as we go forward.\nChris Cartwright: A couple of call points on emerging tenant and employment where we signed this consent order saw revenue turn negative as we had to discontinue certain products. CFPB subsequently has issued guidance to the industry that confirms very tightly to the consent order that we sign. And we\u2019re seeing other industry players adopt similar adjustments and curtailments to the type of information that they\u2019re providing. And we think it\u2019s the good news. We think CFPB levels the plane and once we lap these changes, we\u2019re going to return to zero. The other thing I would mention, the communications vertical [Audio Dip] growth overall, those services that we provide, while they\u2019re mature, they\u2019re extremely profitable, most importantly, the feedstock for the new generation of trusted call solutions that\u2019s driving [Audio Dip].\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Yes. Thank you. I just had a question on mortgage plus pricing. I guess the down 15% in the first half that just seems like kind of continuation of what you saw in the fourth quarter. Just wanted to confirm the plus 10% in the second half, was that purely comp? So is there some other assumption you\u2019ve made in there? And then I think in your prepared remarks, you said pricing going up from your own and third-party. I think we know the third-party, but just wanted some more clarity on where your pricing is going up and how much.\nTodd Cello: Hey, Manav, this is Todd. Can you hear me okay?\nManav Patnaik: I can hear you. Now it\u2019s a little muffled while you\u2019re talking, but right now I heard you fine.\nTodd Cello: Okay. Great. So I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll speak louder. So as far as the assumptions that we have pertaining to our volumes, we are assuming that we\u2019re going to grow \u2013 we\u2019re going to be down 10% in the first half, but up 15% in the second half, I\u2019m just reiterating, and then down 5% for the full year. The assumption is just purely on the comparisons in the second half of the year, there\u2019s no \u2013 we\u2019re not banking on any type of recovery in mortgage. It\u2019s more kind of the same, right? And just to provide a little bit more context on that, when we build our assumptions for mortgage, we\u2019re looking at this across multi-dimensions, the first being our own team and what they\u2019re seeing in the market, the second being our mortgage advisory board. And this is where we\u2019re hearing directly from our customers as it pertains to what their expectations are. And then the third area is where we look at outside data sources just like you do, so for example, the Mortgage Bankers Association. So you take those three elements and that\u2019s how we come up with our guide. The second part was\u2026\nChris Cartwright: Yes, the second part was about the pricing. I\u2019ll wait here, because I didn\u2019t hear it. I mean, obviously, Manav, as you well know, third-party pricing is the biggest driver of price increases in mortgage and has been for the last couple of years. Our comment about our own pricing, you should think of it as more or less consistent with our annual pricing practices. And then again, as we all know, if the Fed were to lower rates mortgage volumes is probably the first area where we would see some uptick.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today, excuse me, comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Can you please go back to your rate cut assumption? Are you assuming no rate cut currently? I mean, if there are three rate cuts as the Fed is projecting right now or even more than three, just like what the market is pricing in. How should we think about the incremental benefit in rent and also EPS in 2024? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Yes. Owen, as it pertains to our interest rate assumption, we are not assuming that the business gives any benefit from interest rate cuts. So think of that as if the interest rates come and there is an uptick in lending, that would all be upside to the guidance that we provided this morning.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Look, this is an opportunity, I think, for us to just provide some context and clarification on the nature of the guidance 3% to 5% organic. Clearly, Todd and I feel the odds are more towards the high end of that range. And again, we wanted to be conservative given the environment in which we\u2019re operating, we\u2019re not modeling in volume increases due to rate cuts, that would all be upside. And we\u2019re steering the business towards what we hope will be outperformance.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on Neustar margins specifically, I think you guided to 32% this year, historically, or I guess previously, you talked about a 40% margin target. Just wondering kind of if that\u2019s still within the realm of expectations over the medium term? What will it take to get up to that level, recognizing that you\u2019ve already gotten the $80 million plus of cost savings in the run rate? Just an update there would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, for sure. So the guide to Neustar margins getting to the level of the full enterprise, at least to peak margin performance was more in the context of a four- to five-year period, right? We\u2019ve had two years of ownership. We\u2019ve added 1,000 basis points. We\u2019re headed toward 32% this year. And while we\u2019ve achieved the $80 million in cost reductions, look, we think there\u2019s more juice in the squeeze, so to speak. We\u2019re not formalizing yet. We\u2019re not guiding to it. The other factor that\u2019s going to give us material margin upside is as the revenue growth rate increases in Neustar, assuming we start to enjoy flattish market conditions on the marketing side, and get some uplift on the risk side through all of the innovation that we\u2019ve done with our fraud mitigation suite, we\u2019re going to get higher flow-through that\u2019s going to help drive margins up to that initial post-acquisition guide.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And that brings us to the end of the call today as we\u2019re bumping up towards the top of the hour now, a very busy day of earnings for everyone. So, I want to thank you for your time today and wish everybody a good rest of the day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and a less than 1% benefit from foreign currency. Our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased 1% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.2%, ahead of our expectations but down 140 basis points compared to the year ago fourth quarter due to lower U.S. financial services volumes, which have high margin flow through. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS increased 2%, adjusted effective tax rate was 21.4% in the quarter and 22% for the full year, below our 23% guidance due to successful tax planning efforts. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we took $78 million in one-time charges related to the next phase of our transformation. The first expenses and what we expect to be a $355 million to $375 million program, inclusive of the final year of Project Rise. These fourth quarter charges were primarily related to employee separation with a modest amount related to office closures. I will provide more color on expectations for charges in 2024 during the guidance section. Before I get into U.S. markets, a reminder that we report Neustar revenue within our vertical market structure. As we've stated previously, starting in 2024, we will stop providing standalone Neustar quarterly revenue growth rates and adjusted EBITDA margins. We will, however, provide updates on how we are progressing to our full year targets to achieve mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2024. Looking at segment financial performance for the fourth quarter, U.S. markets revenue was up 3% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was flat and adjusted EBITDA margin was down 80 basis points to 33.2%. Financial services revenue grew 3% with activity broadly consistent with the levels seen late in the third quarter. Consumer lending revenue declined 3%. Online activity remains soft, but batch marketing has seen some modest improvement among our fintech customers, a sign that players are cautiously anticipating growth. Our credit card and banking business was down 5%, while issuance is healthy on a historical basis, online and batch activity remains tempered as lenders contend with credit normalization, deposit pressures and potential capital constraints. We are seeing stronger activity from our largest customers compared to a more conservative approach by midmarket and smaller institutions. We continue to retain and win share across our customers with momentum in fraud and identity solutions. Our auto business grew \u2013 delivered 1% growth on top of 16% growth in the prior year quarter. New car sales in the U.S. totaled $15.5 million in 2023, up 12% but still below the roughly $17 million of annual sales seen from 2015 to 2019. Sales are expected to increase modestly in 2024. The higher level of new car sales will still take time to replenish the used car market, which saw declining sales in 2023 and continues to face availability and affordability challenges. Used car prices were down in 2023 but are still 30% above pre-pandemic levels. The used car market currently accounts for almost 60% of financed vehicles in the U.S. For mortgage, revenue was up 34% in the quarter against inquiry volume declines of 11%. The pace of volume declines slowed throughout the year, but for the year applications were over 50% below 2019 levels and existing home sales were the weakest since 1995. Average mortgage rates after topping 8% in late October have fallen to 6.5% to 7% range. Rates remain high on a recent historical basis, which combined with elevated home prices and low inventory, will likely limit activity. On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 7% of total TransUnion revenue. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 2% in the quarter. Insurance delivered mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter and 4% for full year 2023 with trends stable and in line with expectations in the fourth quarter. In 2024, we expect to deliver improving growth with momentum as the year progresses. After two years of contracting marketing activity, we expect carriers to slowly restore marketing spend as rate adequacy improves and while consumer shopping activity remains robust. We continue to deliver significant new business wins across our core products as well as with innovative products like TruVision driving history and successful cross selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tech, retail and e-commerce and telco both grew low single digits. Tech, retail and e-commerce benefited from trusted call solutions wins and good, fraud and identity volumes from e-commerce customers, while caller ID drove growth in telco. Media was flat as usage based volumes for our audience solutions remained soft. Across our other emerging verticals, Services and Collections and Public sector both grew double digits, powered by strong growth in trusted call solutions and an employment screening declined as we work through the recalibration of our solutions. We are working to provide the most customer and consumer friendly approach possible and we believe it will create a long-term competitive advantage, particularly as regulators push for more consistent and compliant data usage across vendors. Consumer interactive revenue increased 7%, benefiting from a large breach win. We continue to grow our breach business largely on the strength of the Sontiq offerings. Breach revenues can be uneven, but are increasingly the byproduct of proactively selling recurring cyber protection programs to companies through cyber insurance providers. Breach response engagements also provide new engagements with consumers with opportunities to cross sell them into credit education and identity protection programs. Excluding the large breach win, revenue would have declined 2% in line with our expectations and the current run rate of the business. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 45.5%, down 580 basis points due primarily to the impact of the breach win. Our direct business continues to decline as we recalibrated our marketing approach to focus on higher-value consumers. So far, we've seen good returns on the revamped approach. We continue to work to improve our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in this business. Our indirect business grew led by Sontiq, which grew double digits in the fourth quarter and over 20% for the full year. In addition to stronger-than-expected breach revenue, Sontiq's identity protection business grew double digits. For our traditional credit education products, performance across customers varied based on the idiosyncratic market dynamics. Lenders continue to be selective in utilizing offer aggregators and other channels for marketing. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 13% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 44%, up 20 basis points. Now, let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 30%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. We continue to win share in core consumer credit with an expanding suite of credit-oriented solutions as well as increased penetration of small and medium lenders. This strong core performance is complemented by a meaningful growth across commercial, credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer offerings. We now generate over a third of our India revenue outside of consumer credit, a testament to the success of taking our growth playbook to the Indian market. We expect another very strong year from India in 2024. In the UK, revenue was flat. The UK fintech market remains challenged, but we continue to see good growth in banking and insurance as well as share gains and wins with products like TruVision, trended data and our consumer offerings. Our Canadian business grew 14% despite a tepid macro environment, substantially outperforming flat to slightly declining lending market growth. We benefited from share gains in financial services, strong growth in telco and insurance and continued momentum in direct-to-consumer, including recent breach wins. Material portion of the outsized growth in Canada in 2023 came from sizable share wins, which will be fully annualized in 2024. For 2024, we expect healthy mid-single-digit growth in continued market outperformance. In Latin America, revenue was up 5%, and Brazil was down in the quarter due to weakness in the fintech market. In Colombia and our other Latin American countries, we delivered good growth across online and batch despite softening market conditions with wins across financial services, government and insurance. In Asia Pacific, we grew 13%, led by very strong growth in the Philippines, where we see attractive market growth and increased customer penetration. Hong Kong also had another solid quarter. Finally, Africa increased 11% based on a broadly strong performance despite a challenging environment in several of our largest markets. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.3 billion of debt after prepaying $25 million in the quarter for a total of $250 million in 2023. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.5 billion of debt. That left us with $480 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.6 times. In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. In addition to extending our maturities from 2024 to 2028, we expanded our revolver from $300 million to $600 million, and our Term Loan A from $1 billion to $1.3 billion. We used the incremental $300 million raised for our Term Loan A to prepay $300 million of our higher coupon Term Loan B-6. Last week, we repriced our Term Loan B-6, reducing our credit spread by 25 basis points and removing the credit spread adjustment. The combined impact of these two refinancings results in roughly $8 million of annual interest expense savings. Net of our swaps, our average effective cost of debt at today's SOFR rate is roughly 5%. You can find our updated debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. We continue to focus on the integration of our recent acquisitions and have no intention to make large-scale acquisitions this year. Our priority is to prepay debt in 2024 with our excess cash flow. However, we expect prepayments to be lower than 2023 due to the onetime cash payments related to our transformation program. Cash outlays related to our fourth quarter cost initiative actions were minimal, and we expect most of our $355 million to $375 million of onetime expenses to be paid out in 2024. Based on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low three time range by the end of 2024. We continue to work toward our leverage ratio target of under three times. We do not view three times as an ending point for deleveraging and view debt prepayments as the best incremental use of our cash over the medium term. Turning to guidance, I wanted to first explain our philosophy for 2024. When we provided fourth quarter 2023 guidance in October, we were deliberately very conservative following a challenging third quarter. Our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2024 reflects more typical TransUnion conservatism. We are assuming the current slower conditions persist throughout the year. Should interest rate cuts occur, and drive increased lending and marketing activity that would represent upside to our current guidance. That brings us to our outlook for the first quarter of 2024. We expect FX to have an insignificant impact on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $971 million and $980 million or up 3% to 4% on an as-reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately one point of tailwind from mortgage meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be up 2% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $324 million and $331 million, up 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.4% to 33.8% or down 50 to 90 basis points. Margins are expected to be down sequentially and year-over-year due to the timing of expenses in international, particularly India as well as Consumer Interactive. We expect year-over-year margin expansion in our U.S. markets business in the first quarter. We expect the first quarter to be our lowest margin quarter with margins expanding each quarter as transformation savings build throughout the year. We also expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.79 and $0.81 a range of down 2% to up 1%. Turning to the full year. We expect insignificant impact from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $3.96 billion and $4.02 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as-reported and organic constant currency basis and up about 1.5% to 3.5%, excluding the impact of mortgage. For 2024, we expect mortgage inquiries to be down roughly 5% and our revenues to increase roughly 25%, primarily due to the impact of third-party scores pricing. We expect inquiries to be down roughly 15% in the first half of the year and up roughly 10% in the second half of the year as comparisons ease. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or low single digit, excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up mid-single digits or up low single digits, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digits. We anticipate that international will grow high single digits in constant currency terms, driven by the same positive trends that we saw throughout 2023. And we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.398 billion and $1.441 billion, up 4% to 7%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.3% to 35.8% or up 25 to 75 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.57 to $3.74, up 6% to 11%. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $245 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $245 million for the full year, down over $20 million year-over-year, primarily due to our 2023 debt prepayments, recent refinancings and lower SOFR. We expect to take an incremental roughly $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. Combined with $78 million of charges in the fourth quarter, we expect a total of roughly $280 million spent through 2024 compared to $355 million to $375 million of total program costs, which are expected to be completed in 2025. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue. I want to wrap up with some additional detail about our expectations for adjusted EBITDA in 2024. A key driver of adjusted EBITDA growth is flow-through from higher revenue inclusive of continued investment in the business. Based on the high end of our guidance, we expect to grow revenues by roughly $190 million and adjusted EBITDA by $65 million. While we are adding absolute adjusted EBITDA dollars, the lower than typical incremental margin is due to mix of revenue growth outside of core credit as well as targeted investments, primarily to support the strong growth in our International segment. When lending activity picks up, we expect to see strong incremental margins. Second positive is savings from our transformation program, which we expect to deliver roughly $65 million in benefit, in line with our commitment in November. We expect the savings benefit to build throughout the year. We also expect $20 million to $25 million of benefit from continued Neustar acquisition synergies and as well as reduced Sontiq in Argus integration costs in 2024. Partially offsetting these positives is resetting our annual incentive compensation costs to target after a below-target payout in 2023 in addition to annual merit increases. Taken together, we expect a good year for adjusted EBITDA growth with expected additional transformation savings still to come and further upside if we see any step-up in credit volumes. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. And just to add on to that, Toni, just to provide some sizing for fintech. We talked about in 2022 that we did about $175 million last year in the U.S., we're talking about and \u2013 we brought it \u2013 last year, we saw it come down to $140 million. So that's the 20% that Chris is referring to. Reason for bringing that out is TransUnion has a very nice position with fintechs that we've spoken about, and our team's done a great job building those relationships. And in the whole scheme of our revenue, it's less than 4% of the overall company's revenue. So just wanted to make certain that was appropriately sized in response to your question. We see tremendous opportunity though, for us, as we believe that those customers are on a path to growing again and we're best positioned to take advantage of that. Hey Ashish, I'll take that one from you. So the \u2013 I think the heart of your question really comes down to the guidance that we provided for the emerging verticals and that we're assuming to be low-single digits. And really the way to think about that, the way we look at it is we break the emerging verticals into different segments. And you alluded to already insurance. We're expecting insurance to have a good year in 2024. The team has signed many new clients, so there's significant new business wins that will come to fruition in the year. As we spoke about in our prepared remarks, marketing is improving slowly. So we're cautiously optimistic about that. And shopping activity remains strong. So all in all, insurance, we're expecting a good year, probably in the mid-single-digits of growth. Also in the emerging verticals, we're expecting good growth in services and collections as well as in our public sector verticals. And a lot of that growth is coming from trusted call solutions, where we've seen significant, meaningful growth. And obviously that's the capability that came with Neustar acquisition.  So those three verticals of insurance, services and collections, and public sector represent about 40% of the emergency \u2013 revenue. So that means the other 60% to talk about expecting good growth out of those three. So in that other 60% [Audio Dip] business, here, as you're well aware to recalibrate due to a consent order that signed with the CFPB, [Audio Dip] opted our product to provide [Audio Dip] reports that we provide [Audio Dip] space. But it's going to take us a little bit of time in that, we probably more, maybe in the second half of the year [Audio Dip] get back to the growth expectations. Second thing that is [Audio Dip] communication. The communication vertical is where much of use are [Audio Dip] capabilities, for example. So think of caller ID TransUnion now provides [Audio Dip] That's kind of a flattish business. And it's also a bigger, so needless to say that [Audio Dip] to the growth rate then also the media vertical has tempered expectations for us in 2024 [Audio Dip] what Chris spoke about earlier with the generation [Audio Dip] volume dependent. So if there's a recovery coming on the market side, that would be something that would benefit. I highlight those three, because those are the three where our expectations are a little bit and consistent with the guidance that we've provided for the year. This is just where we're being prudent [Audio Dip] provide guide here that's overly take it one quarter at a time as we go forward. Hey, Manav, this is Todd. Can you hear me okay? Okay. Great. So I'm going to \u2013 I'll speak louder. So as far as the assumptions that we have pertaining to our volumes, we are assuming that we're going to grow \u2013 we're going to be down 10% in the first half, but up 15% in the second half, I'm just reiterating, and then down 5% for the full year. The assumption is just purely on the comparisons in the second half of the year, there's no \u2013 we're not banking on any type of recovery in mortgage. It's more kind of the same, right? And just to provide a little bit more context on that, when we build our assumptions for mortgage, we're looking at this across multi-dimensions, the first being our own team and what they're seeing in the market, the second being our mortgage advisory board. And this is where we're hearing directly from our customers as it pertains to what their expectations are. And then the third area is where we look at outside data sources just like you do, so for example, the Mortgage Bankers Association. So you take those three elements and that's how we come up with our guide. The second part was... Yes. Owen, as it pertains to our interest rate assumption, we are not assuming that the business gives any benefit from interest rate cuts. So think of that as if the interest rates come and there is an uptick in lending, that would all be upside to the guidance that we provided this morning."

            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda from the call this morning. First, I will provide the financial highlights for our fourth quarter 2023 results. Second, I will detail our 2024 strategic priorities to drive value across TU. And finally, Todd will detail our fourth quarter results along with our first quarter and full year 2024 guidance. In the fourth quarter, we exceeded our guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. Revenue grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, with growth across all segments. U.S. markets grew 3% with Financial Services up 3% and Emerging Verticals at 2%. In Financial Services, lending and marketing activity remained consistent with the levels seen late in the third quarter with no further deterioration in volume. In Emerging Verticals, insurance improved to mid single-digit growth driven by new business wins. Services and Collections and Public Sector both grew double-digits. Neustar delivered 4% growth in the quarter, in line with our expectations and accretive to our U.S. markets growth. Communication remains a standout driven by trusted call solutions, which grew almost 50% in the quarter. In Marketing and Risk Solutions, our subscription base remains healthy and bookings in the second half of the year were strong, which offsets still soft transaction revenues. For the year, Neustar grew revenues by 5% and expanded adjusted EBITDA margin to 31%, up 1,000 basis points in our two years of ownership. Our International segment grew by 13% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of innovation, share gains and expansion into new adjacencies. India led with 30% revenue growth, while Canada, Asia-Pacific and Africa grew double-digits as well. In November, we launched the next phase of our transformation program, focused on growing our global capability center network and enhancing our technology capabilities. We expect this transformation to deliver significant operating expense savings and reduce capital expenditures by 2026, while accelerating innovation and enabling growth. I will share more detail on this program shortly. We prepaid another $25 million of debt during the quarter for a total of $250 million in 2023. We also completed refinancings in October and February that will reduce our annual interest expense by $8 million in 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, we delivered good results and achieved key transformation milestones despite a challenging environment for many of our geographies and end markets. Our performance highlights the resiliency of our business model the relevance of our innovations \u2013 innovative solutions and the benefits of our vertical product and geographic diversification. As we turn to 2024, and we believe three strategic priorities will create significant value for TransUnion and our shareholders. The first is to accelerate revenue and earnings growth. The second is to leverage Neustar's product and technology capabilities further. And the third is to execute the transformation initiatives that we announced in November. Let me spend a bit more time discussing each now. Now Todd will provide full financial guidance, but at a high level, we expect to deliver 3% to 5% revenue growth, 4% to 7% adjusted EBITDA growth and 6% to 11% adjusted diluted EPS growth. We expect economic growth to moderate in 2024 and lending volumes to remain steady. Consumer finances in the U.S. remain healthy due to low unemployment and real wage growth. Inflation has moderated, and the Fed has indicated that interest rate cuts are likely in 2024 and beyond, although, the timing and magnitude remain uncertain. Rate reductions will benefit the most rate-sensitive lending products, particularly mortgage and to a lesser extent, auto and personal loans, and also reduce interest payments to already leveraged consumers. Although demand for credit remains healthy, lending standards are still cautious. Some lenders have faced pressure from deposit outflows, rising delinquencies and concerns over potentially increasing capital requirements. The largest banks echoed this caution during recent earnings expressing optimism for a soft landing, but forecasting modest loan growth. TransUnion maintained strong positions across customers of all sizes and has enjoyed share gains in each market segment over the last decade. In our international markets, the UK, Canada and many of our Latin American countries are also experiencing slowing economic trends, although we expect India to continue to outperform. We expect to deliver good results in this environment. We believe many of our financial services end markets are at or near their bottom. For 2024, we are assuming that economic conditions remain stable with steady, albeit slower lending volumes. Any benefits from potential interest rate cuts and their impact on lending or marketing activity represents upside to our assumptions. Several factors underpin our confidence. First, we expect to realize the benefits of a strong sales year in 2023 and expect further momentum in 2024. Despite subdued volumes across many of our verticals in 2023, our U.S. sales team did an excellent job winning new business, culminating in strong sales in the fourth quarter for both financial services and our diversified markets. Customer demand remains strong across our verticals and solutions. Second, our vertical orientation provides diversification and growth levers that are independent of the lending environment and interest rate moves. We expect improving growth in our largest U.S. emerging vertical insurance driven by new business wins and customers slowly restoring marketing spend. We have also meaningfully expanded the breadth and depth of our product portfolio. We continue to enhance our value proposition and core credit and to launch new fraud, marketing solutions which combine TransUnion and Neustar strengths and Trusted Call Solutions is scaling rapidly with the potential for expansion internationally. Third, we expect strong revenue growth from international, which has grown revenues organically by double digits every year since our 2015 IPO except for in 2020 due to COVID. India is our largest international market and grew revenues to almost $220 million in 2023, up over 30% and contributing roughly 1.5 points to total company growth. We have grown more than 30% in India every year since 2017 with the exception of 2020, we expect all geographies to contribute to growth in 2024. And finally, this year, we expect to benefit from typical pricing actions both our own and third parties. We also remain highly focused on increasing profitability by driving savings from our transformation program and acquisition synergies in addition to prudent cost management. Now, key to our growth strategy is continuing to integrate Neustar successfully. Over the last two years, Neustar has been accretive to our U.S. markets growth rate and has scaled its standalone margins significantly. In 2024, we expect Neustar to grow revenue by mid-single digits. Our guidance assumes strong subscription revenue growth from our 2023 bookings and continued bookings momentum in 2024, but for soft volumes to persist in the more transactional parts of the business, which account for 20% of Neustar's revenue. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin at Neustar to be roughly 32% in 2024. We are allocating investment dollars to scaling fast growing and high potential products like Trusted Call Solutions and our identity-based marketing offerings, two of the most exciting opportunities across TransUnion. For this reason, we look at margin progress at U.S. markets as the more relevant statistic. We continue to deliver cost synergies and as of the end of 2023, we achieved our $80 million plus run rate target, already above the $70 million referenced at the time of acquisition. This does not include the benefits of material technology savings from our transformation program, which is enabled and accelerated by Neustar's state-of-the-art data and analytics platform, now called OneTru. We continue to achieve key milestones that can accelerate growth at Neustar and across TransUnion in 2024 and beyond. Now, we expect Communications Solutions to grow on the strength of Trusted Call Solutions or TCS. Since its launch in 2018, TCS has scaled to $80 million in 2023, up $30 million or 60% over the prior year. We expect the business to grow over 40% in 2024. TCS is revolutionizing inbound and outbound voice calling for our customers, improving answering rates, reducing fraud and increasing efficiency. Demand remains robust and we continue to win new customers across every vertical. Additionally, we're rolling out highly requested enhancements, including displaying logos for business calls to consumers, which recently launched with AT&A and blocking spoof calls before they reach consumers. TCS is already a needle mover for U.S. markets and total company growth rates, and we see a clear right to win in what we believe could be a $1 billion addressable market in the U.S. over the longer-term. We also see broad application across several geographies and will soon be announcing our next international launch in one of TransUnion's largest markets. In marketing, we integrated 22 additional TU and Neustar data assets into our new unified identity graph. Our entire marketing suite is now utilizing this unified graph that incorporates our best data. It enhances the depth, breadth and accuracy of consumer data across offline and online customer channels. With a newly improved identity graph, we cover 98% of the U.S. adult population with 700 plus demographic attributes and are seeing a 20%-plus increase in marketable phone numbers and e-mails and 50%-plus increase in targetable addresses. This identity centric approach is resonating with customers, particularly as they contend with the reality of third-party cookie deprecation, which Google is starting limited test of cookie restrictions. We're well-positioned to serve our customers during this transition, differentiating with our highly authoritative first party identity data as well as direct integration into walled gardens and publishers with privacy enhancing technologies such as clean rooms and partnerships with cloud marketplaces such as Snowflake, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud. In Risk Solutions, we expect accelerating growth driven by strong bookings of our contact center products in the second half of 2023. We're consolidating Neustar's risk capabilities onto TruValidate to deliver omni-channel fraud mitigation and have invested incrementally in go-to-market capacity. Our third strategic focus area for 2024 is executing our ongoing transformation initiatives. Since I became CEO in 2019, we have invested in global platforms across our product, operations, technology and data and analytics teams to build scale, foster knowledge sharing and develop standardized way of operating across the world. These initiatives accelerate innovation, streamline workflows, reduce costs and create better user experiences for customers and consumers. In November, we announced the next step of our transformation, comprising two complementary programs. First, we will build upon our strategy of leveraging our global capability centers across the globe, driving workforce productivity and allowing us to provide more services from talent rich geographies like India, South Africa and Costa Rica. We grew our GCCs from 400 employees in 2019 to over 4,000 in 2023 and expect to transition over 1,000 additional roles over the next two years. We are balancing the need for customer centric work in market with the opportunity to centralize and standardize key global functions. Second, we will enhance our technology capabilities by completing our project rise cloud migration and leveraging Neustar's technology to consolidate our product and innovation enablement onto a common state-of-the-art platform, OneTru. We expect this transformation to drive material revenue and cost benefits. By 2026, we expect to deliver $120 million to $140 million of annual operating expense savings with half of that realized in 2024. We also expect to reduce our CapEx spend from the historical 8% of revenue to 6% by 2026, The equivalent of $70 million to $80 million in annual cash savings. Now to achieve these savings, we expect to incur $355 million to $375 million of one-time costs. This is inclusive of $65 million already communicated for Project Rise. In simple terms, we expect to deliver roughly $200 million of ongoing annual free cash flow benefit for $300 million of incremental one-time costs. Just as importantly, these investments, particularly OneTru will accelerate our innovation rates. OneTru will enable our growth strategy of extending further into marketing and fraud solutions. These two fast growing markets are highly synergistic with our core credit markets. Put simply, we're not a Credit Bureau attempting to play in the identity space, we are a consumer identity bureau applying these capabilities to credit data along with marketing and fraud solutions to serve our customers. We believe that the complementary nature of credit, marketing and fraud will fuel growth across all three markets. OneTru will become the destination platform for activating our data assets in a single integrated technology stack across all global TransUnion product families, from data ingestion, data management and identity resolution to analytics and delivery. The platform is built on top of a foundational hybrid cloud infrastructure developed through Project Rise and leverages Neustar's architecture. OneTru is already live and powering TransUnion products and the next two years are about enhancing capabilities and consolidating more products, data and analytics onto the platform. We believe that OneTru will improve our data quality, speed our time to market and accelerate innovation. From a cost perspective, OneTru will also save costs, enabling us to rationalize applications and standardize services. These efficiencies will allow our engineers to spend more time focused on innovation. This standardized operating model will also ensure a compliance and privacy first approach using embedded security guardrails. The OneTru platform is increasing our pace of innovation and enabling the next generation of products. Let me highlight a few examples. In our TruIQ analytics suite, we leverage OneTru to improve the quality of our analytics services by reducing the time to insights and actions. In the past, we've discussed our TruIQ Innovation Labs, where our scientists collaborate with customers in multi-day hands on sessions, infusing our data, analytics and domain expertise to solve their business problems. Last year, we ran a host of these labs on the OneTru platform, clients benefited from real time interaction with our data and analytics for faster model development and deployment. The feedback has been very positive. By integrating our products on this common platform, we'll be able to serve clients' needs across multiple and previously siloed domains and convert our engagement seamlessly into ongoing revenues. We also recently launched TruIQ Data Enrichment, which provides instant access to TU data from within the customer's technology environment. This privacy first approach to data enrichment eliminates the need for sensitive client IP to leave their control. The solution streamlines access to credit and marketing data and accelerates model development. Advanced Acquisitions is a new offering that combines Data Enrichment with our credit and marketing capabilities for an integrated credit based pre-screen solution. Advanced Acquisitions powers a full range of consumer acquisition tools including self service, batch pre-screens, acquisition campaign, model development and deployment, and marketing audience definition, build and activation. TransUnion's media planning and measurement tools are also available on the OneTru platform to ensure effective marketing spend. We're also consolidating our fraud mitigation products globally onto OneTru in an integrated suite called TruValidate. TruValidate combines our comprehensive identity data along with fraud signals from a range of Neustar and TU products in a single platform where we apply advanced analytics fueled by machine learning and AI to extract deep insights. Our result or rather the result has been a substantial improvement in fraud detection and a reduction in false positives. We're currently beta testing our first release and expect the full rollout this summer. Our fraud product suite serves thousands of customers around the world and represents roughly $300 million of revenues against a multibillion dollar addressable market. We see substantial opportunity to gain share by offering a high performance integrated suite of solutions amplified by best-in-class analytics, which we believe will outperform the patchwork of point solutions that many customers use today. And finally, we're creating new and innovative marketing solutions in addition to the ongoing enhancements to our identity capabilities. TruAudience data collaborations, which we formerly called clean rooms, is a next generation offering to enable data collaboration between parties that don't want to directly exchange data, but must connect to partners across the advertising ecosystem. It's currently in market, in beta testing and will fully launch later this year. Client feedback is enthusiastic and we're working with the walled gardens to drive adoption. I look forward to providing you updates on these product advancements in the coming quarters. And with that, I'll turn it over to Todd, who'll provide further details on our fourth quarter financial results, our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. Todd? Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we exceeded fourth quarter expectations, driven by stable lending and marketing conditions in the U.S. and robust growth from international. We expect a strong year in 2024 with mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth. We're focused on three strategic priorities for the year to create value for TU accelerating revenue and earnings growth, leveraging Neustar's product and technology capabilities further and executing on our transformation initiatives. Finally, on a personal note, as many of you know, Aaron Hoffman has decided to retire from TransUnion in March. Aaron has been instrumental in building out the Investor Relations function at TU and has been a valuable resource to our management team and to investors alike. We've been lucky to have him over these last eight years, and we wish him a happy retirement. We're also excited to have Greg Bardi, who has been working with Aaron in these last three years and covered TransUnion on the sell-side before that. Leading our Investor Relations going forward. Now let me turn the time over to Aaron. Yes. Good morning, Jeff. I think I'll start answering that, Steven. Yes, so on the Neustar front, the headwind to hitting our growth targets there beyond mid-single digits has been the decline in the transactional components of the portfolio. In a more difficult economic environment, marketing and advertising activity has pulled back. In addition to the volume slowdown, we've seen with clients working to reduce data costs, right, and relying more on first-party data. So both of those have been headwinds to our sales. We've compensated a bit for the cutback on the data side by selling more first-party record hygiene and identity resolution services. So really, what we need is, I think, a stable floor in those areas and perhaps some rebound in activity. The guidance that we provide at Neustar is consistent with our overall guidance this period. It's intended to be conservative, yet constructive we're pushing to exceed that guidance and we hope we'll be able to do over the course of the year. Yes. So obviously, Andrew, we have been navigating a pivot in the consumer business over the past 18 months or so. Part of that is the direct business, which has been in decline in part because of market demand shifting more towards premium, but also some adjustments in our marketing practices. That area has been the most pronounced decliner. Where we're at now is we can see it getting to kind of a neutral state over the course of the year, sometime probably mid-second quarter, a combination of reaching an equilibrium on our marketing practices and enjoying the benefits of the annual price increase and the like. We expect indirect to remain kind of a low single-digit grower over the course of the year. And of course, breach protection and identity protection through our Neustar acquisition \u2013 I'm sorry, through our Sontiq acquisition is doing particularly well. It grew over 20% last year, had a really strong fourth quarter. Again, think of the consumer guide in total in the context of an overall conservative corporate guide, right, where we're steering more towards the high end of things. And look, I think its important just to emphasize in the big with regard to TU in the consumer space is that, we believe we will return this business back to consistent positive organic growth. And we intend to compete across the full dimension of opportunities, whether that be identity protection, freemium offering, and the like. Sure. So in U.S. Financial Services, I mean, look, as we know, there was a year of turmoil in 2023, not only were we dealing with the impact of inflation and much higher interest rate, which slowed demand. But we're also dealing with deposit outflows from certain segments in banking because of the instability that we experienced in the second quarter. That led to a material slowdown in September of last year. We modeled a continuation of that slowdown in the fourth quarter, in fact, a deterioration from that rate. It turned out that, that was a bit conservative, and we overperform that, as you can see. Turning to 2024, we think we're at or near a floor in most of these services, but we're not assuming any improvement, right. So we kind of budgeted for steady volume across the different subcategories of financial services in the U.S. over the course of the year. Now growth rates are going to improve in the second half because comparables are easier in the second half. And of course, by the second half, we're getting the full benefit of price actions of both our own and third parties. But it's kind of a steady sailing forecast, if you will. We're not building in any uplift from the potential for interest rate reductions by the Fed. Yes. Well, last year was an especially difficult one for fintech, largely because of the increase in borrowing costs and the difficulty of getting funding. And I think also some concerns about the health of the consumer from the third quarter forward. We saw a pretty material reduction here in the U.S. That segment probably fell roughly 20% last year. Again, our assumptions for 2024 are more or less steady from the volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. we're encouraged by the stability that we're seeing. And we're encouraged by an uptick in some batch activity which suggests that there will be more marketing activity in this space, but we haven't modeled too much of that optimism into the guide. Yes. And you also mentioned the UK, I mean, clearly it was even more difficult year. Today, you had a number of players that exited the market, that impacted our overall fed in the UK. We're continuing to \u2013 high-single digit growth... Hey. So Kelsey, I think I followed the question. We had a little bit of a technical glitch here, but I think you're talking about mortgage headwinds due to a rollout of the single bureau prequalification that the FHFA has sponsored. We have modeled that into our assumptions. So it is baked into the guide that we have provided. We expect that it will cause some volume deterioration, but again, that's factored into. Well, that's just one factor in our process of estimating where we think mortgage volumes will be. So we look at all of the publicly available information, we talk to our client advisory board. We've got the historical trajectory of this, and then we have made some adjustments for an industry-wide adoption of a single bureau pull at prequalification. Sure. Todd? A couple of call points on emerging tenant and employment where we signed this consent order saw revenue turn negative as we had to discontinue certain products. CFPB subsequently has issued guidance to the industry that confirms very tightly to the consent order that we sign. And we're seeing other industry players adopt similar adjustments and curtailments to the type of information that they're providing. And we think it's the good news. We think CFPB levels the plane and once we lap these changes, we're going to return to zero. The other thing I would mention, the communications vertical [Audio Dip] growth overall, those services that we provide, while they're mature, they're extremely profitable, most importantly, the feedstock for the new generation of trusted call solutions that's driving [Audio Dip]. Yes, the second part was about the pricing. I'll wait here, because I didn't hear it. I mean, obviously, Manav, as you well know, third-party pricing is the biggest driver of price increases in mortgage and has been for the last couple of years. Our comment about our own pricing, you should think of it as more or less consistent with our annual pricing practices. And then again, as we all know, if the Fed were to lower rates mortgage volumes is probably the first area where we would see some uptick. Yes. Look, this is an opportunity, I think, for us to just provide some context and clarification on the nature of the guidance 3% to 5% organic. Clearly, Todd and I feel the odds are more towards the high end of that range. And again, we wanted to be conservative given the environment in which we're operating, we're not modeling in volume increases due to rate cuts, that would all be upside. And we're steering the business towards what we hope will be outperformance. Yes, for sure. So the guide to Neustar margins getting to the level of the full enterprise, at least to peak margin performance was more in the context of a four- to five-year period, right? We've had two years of ownership. We've added 1,000 basis points. We're headed toward 32% this year. And while we've achieved the $80 million in cost reductions, look, we think there's more juice in the squeeze, so to speak. We're not formalizing yet. We're not guiding to it. The other factor that's going to give us material margin upside is as the revenue growth rate increases in Neustar, assuming we start to enjoy flattish market conditions on the marketing side, and get some uplift on the risk side through all of the innovation that we've done with our fraud mitigation suite, we're going to get higher flow-through that's going to help drive margins up to that initial post-acquisition guide."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations Web site this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with their corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our Web site. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release and the comments made during this earnings call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With all that, let me turn it over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. Let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions we're facing and the impact that they had on our business in the third quarter. Then I'll provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress we're making with Neustar, accelerating revenue growth and achieving savings targets. I'll wrap up with a short discussion about our approach to managing through a more challenging and uncertain macro environment. Finally, Todd will detail our third quarter results, along with our fourth quarter and full year guidance. Economic conditions softened across several TransUnion markets in the third quarter, most notably in the US and the UK. While US consumers continue to benefit from low unemployment and modest real wage growth, lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs have taken a toll on household finances. Spending has slowed and consumers have largely spent through the excess savings accumulated during COVID. Although demand for credit remains strong despite elevated costs, banks have tightened lending standards due to weakening consumer finances and increasing capital constraints. Recent commentary from lenders supports these observations, noting that cracks have appeared across consumer lending, especially in the lower credit tiers. Now TransUnion entered the third quarter cautiously optimistic after exceeding guidance in the first two quarters, while maintaining our full year guidance as a cushion against ongoing economic uncertainty. However, lending volumes in the US and UK softened progressively over the third quarter, causing our revenues to come in slightly under the low end of our guidance. In US Financial Services, year-over-year revenue grew 3% in July and 1% in August, but declined 5% in September. Rising rates in the quarter had a negative impact as the 10-year treasury rate spiked 50 basis points after only increasing 20 basis points in the first half of the year. The decrease in loan demand combined with tighter credit standards also fueled a pullback in marketing activity, which negatively affected our consumer audience and campaign management volumes. We experienced a similar slowdown in our insurance vertical where carriers remain primarily focused on increasing profitability and have reduced marketing to acquire new customers. Insurance revenue grew 5% in July, 4% in August, but declined 4% in September. Increasing policy renewal rates and carriers exiting unprofitable geographies is fueling increased consumer shopping, which only partially offsets the decline in marketing volumes. And while policy attrition from large carriers is often acquired by smaller and nonstandard carriers, TU typically realizes less revenue per transaction as smaller carriers usually do not utilize our full product suite. Financial Services and insurance volumes have a high flow through to profits and their softening has weighed on our adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin. Our International segment continues to benefit from healthy economic conditions in India and Asia Pacific and strong market outperformance in Canada. Other parts of the portfolio, such as the UK, Latin America and Africa slowed over the quarter, although segment revenues in total were up low double digits. In the third quarter, TransUnion grew revenues 3% organically driven by strength in international, Neustar and several verticals within US emerging markets. US markets grew 2% with Financial Services flat and Emerging Verticals up 4% in total due to high single digit revenue growth in Neustar. Our bookings remained strong overall, including within Financial Services insurance and media, and we continue to benefit from our portfolio diversification as we grew double digits in public sector and media and high single digits in tech, retail and e-commerce, all areas of recent organic and inorganic investment. Revenue in our International segment grew by 11% in constant currency in September for the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 31% revenue growth while Canada and APAC also grew revenues double digits. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of solution innovation, share gains and expansion into new adjacencies. We prepaid another $75 million of debt during the quarter, bringing our total for the first nine months to $225 million, and we expect to make further prepayments in the fourth quarter. We also settled two legal matters with the CFPB and the FTC with no admission of wrongdoing. We're pleased to have resolved these matters and to proceed with our work of providing important business services to help consumers reach their goals. Neustar delivered 7% revenue growth in the quarter despite increased macroeconomic headwinds and is proving to be nicely accretive to our growth rates in our core US verticals, even in these challenging market conditions. While bookings and subscriptions continued their strong growth, Neustar's transactional revenues in Marketing and Risk Solutions softened in the quarter. As a result, we're reducing our fourth quarter growth assumptions in line with volumes in September and lowering our full year guide to mid single digits growth instead of high single digits. We also expect a 31% EBITDA margin, up around 450 basis points over 2022 as we complete integration and achieve our target cost synergies. Now in the quarter, we announced a number of new partnerships that further support our confidence in Neustar's growth prospects. In marketing, we signed a substantial multiyear identity deal with a large CPG company as well as new business with a large apparel company in a major personal care brand. We also announced that our Marketing Solutions business through audience will integrate its identity product line with AWS entity resolution from Amazon Web Services. TruAudience brings advanced identity resolution capabilities to AWS customers to improve their data hygiene and customer insights from within AWS' secure cloud environment. Communications Solutions continue to grow on the strength of our suite of trusted -- of TruContact trusted call solutions or TCS, which grew about 70% in the third quarter across a range of verticals. We recently expanded our relationship with one of the three major wireless carriers in the US to become their exclusive provider for branded calling, part of our TCS solutions suite. Branded calling allows users to place their brand and call purpose on outbound calls to cut through the fog of anonymous robo calls and securely engage with clients and prospects. We also won a multiyear multimillion dollar with a large federal government agency to provide branded call display. We're enjoying strong growth in our TCS solutions and broad interest across our verticals as clients value improved answer rates and reduce costs. Now I want to wrap up my part of the call by reinforcing our long-term approach to creating shareholder value even as macroeconomic and lending market conditions may cycle. We're focused on helping our customers address their current market challenges by applying our complementary credit, marketing and fraud solutions through our insight-led consultative approach. With tightening lending standards, declining loan volumes and rising delinquencies, our rich trended and alternative credit data and powerful analytics and modeling tools will help lenders maximize their portfolios and find attractive segments for growth. Our marketing solutions enable customers to optimize their spending and ensure positive outcomes, which is even more important in challenging conditions. Our identity resolution, audience segmentation and predictive analytics help clients understand which customers to contact, how best to reach them and what messages will most likely resonate. Planning and measuring the effectiveness of marketing spending by utilizing our rich history of pipeline conversion data ensures that the best results are achieved with the least possible investment and our trusted call and fraud mitigation solutions also help clients reach consumers more efficiently and minimize their fraud losses. We continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that will position us for our next chapter of growth and profitability. These include innovations from combining the best of Neustar and TransUnion, launching our next generation fraud mitigation platform and scaling our new products across our thriving international footprint and reducing our cost structurally by scaling our global capability centers, refining our organization structure and standardizing and modernizing our core technologies and operations remains key objectives for TransUnion. Through the series of initiatives, many of which have been in progress for some time now, we believe we can further reduce operating costs materially. Given the more challenging growth environment in which we find ourselves, we are accelerating these efforts and we'll share additional details when appropriate. We also remain laser focused on achieving the cost savings from our acquisition integrations and reducing our interest expense through prepayment of our debt. That concludes my comments this morning on our market conditions, our third quarter performance and our approach to managing through these softer market conditions. Todd will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results and our fourth quarter and our full year 2023 outlook. Over to you, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 3% on a reported and constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and immaterial FX impact. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency. This result was negatively impacted by an incremental $7 million charge for the recent legal settlements above the amount we previously reserved. We also benefited from a reversal of accruals for variable cash compensation to account for our current view of revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.8%, up 50 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter and improved sequentially by 180 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 2% as a result of higher interest expense. Finally, we took a $495 million impairment to our UK business during the quarter. This remains an attractive market and business for TransUnion with a highly diversified portfolio, an array of successful product offerings like TruVision and TruEmpower and an adjusted EBITDA margin over 40%. Leveraging our innovation, we've gained meaningful share across the lending ecosystem and delivered market leading growth under our ownership. However, the UK has faced an unusually harsh confluence of macro events resulting in inflationary pressures and soaring interest rates which has slowed the underlying lending growth. Before I get into US markets results, a reminder that we are reporting Neustar revenue within our Vertical market structure and we will discontinue providing stand-alone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023. Now looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. US markets revenues were up 2% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for US markets increased 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was flat at 35.2%. Financial Services revenue was flat. Consumer lending revenue declined 9% compared to single digit growth in the third quarter of 2022. Absolute lending [volumes] remain healthy as unsecured personal loans have become a mainstream product for our consumers. With that said, marketing activity remains depressed. Rising rates have weighed on consumer demand and capital funding continues to be highly selective. Our credit card business was down 5% compared to low double-digit growth in the year ago quarter with marketing down mid-teens. Issuers continue to react to rising delinquencies by moderating marketing spend. With that said, like with consumer lending, activity levels for card remain healthy on a historical basis. Our auto business delivered 6% growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, pricing, strong prequalification volumes, the impact of cross-selling Neustar marketing and call center solutions. We are seeing strong demand for new vehicles, somewhat offset by continued weakness in the used vehicle market and challenges around affordability. For mortgage, revenue was up 26% in the quarter despite inquiry volumes falling about 21%. As Chris pointed out, growth slowed considerably over the course of the quarter as mortgage rates jumped to 20 year highs in recent weeks. Existing home sales reached their lowest level since 2011 and applications in mid-October fell to their lowest point since 1995. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 7% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 30% and our revenue to increase roughly 15%. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 4% in the quarter. Insurance delivered low single-digit growth despite the challenges that Chris described. Even in this environment, we continue to win new business for innovative products like TruVision driving history, which has grown fivefold over the past five years. Penetration of newer markets like life and commercial auto and successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tenant and employment screening was down as we've recalibrated our solutions to provide the most customer and consumer friendly approach possible. This has cost us some volume in the short term but we believe it will ultimately be a long-term competitive advantage. The public sector, media and tech, retail and e-commerce verticals all delivered strong growth, highlighting the value of our diversified business and in particular the benefits of integrating Neustar solutions into existing TransUnion end markets to enhance growth. The telco vertical was down slightly as declines in landline caller ID offset growth in other areas like trusted call solutions. Consumer Interactive revenue declined 3% in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 50.4%, up about 80 basis points as a result of more focused advertising spending. Our direct business continues to see moderating declines as we recalibrated our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we've seen good returns on the revamped tactics with better than expected customer acquisition stats at attractive cost to acquire. Our indirect business was flat as lenders have pulled back on utilizing offer aggregators and other channels for marketing, like the trends we're experiencing in our financial services vertical. Our breach and identity protection offerings built through our acquisition of Sontiq, continued to deliver good growth. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 11% with three of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.3%, up about 95 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, our largest international market, we grew 31%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets as well as from fraud, marketing and direct to consumer offerings. We continue to expect India to deliver another year of over 30% growth. In the UK, revenue declined 4%. Excluding revenue related to onetime contracts included with the UK government, we would have declined 2%. While the UK fintech market continues to be challenged, the rest of our business is growing despite the challenged macro environment with good growth in banking driven by share gains and traction with products like TruVision and CreditView as well as strong performance in insurance and gaming. Our Canadian business grew 17% in the third quarter. While the market remains low growth, we have generated strong outperformance across our portfolio and continue to win new share in financial services, fintech insurance and direct-to-consumer. In Latin America, revenue was up 3% with healthy online performance offset by a decline in batch marketing activity. Brazil was down in the quarter as we've seen some weakness in the fintech market. While macro conditions softened across Latin America, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, insurance, government and telcos. In Asia Pacific, we grew 12% from continued good performance in Hong Kong and very strong growth in Philippines where we continue to add new offerings and win new business. Finally, Africa increased 8% based on a broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region despite a challenging macroeconomic and social environment in several of our largest markets. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.4 billion of debt after prepaying another $75 million in the quarter, that left us with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.7 times. We have now prepaid $225 million of debt in 2023 and at this point, we intend to prepay additional debt in the fourth quarter. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.5 billion of debt. We're in the midst of refinancing our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A that matures on December 10, 2024. Based on early indications, we expect a favorable outcome and we will update you when we complete this transaction. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not in our plans this year. We are focused on integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect FX to be insignificant to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $917 million and $932 million or up 2% to 3% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 2 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% on an organic constant currency basis. We are reducing our revenue assumption considerably from that implied in our previous guidance. We have essentially extrapolated the difficult September results across the fourth quarter to better match the current trends in our business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $303 million and $315 million, down 2% to 6%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 180 to 260 basis points. I want to spend a minute on the sequential change quarter-over-quarter in our adjusted EBITDA expectations. The high end of our fourth quarter is $41 million lower than the actual result for the third quarter. More than three quarters of that change is a result of the reduced revenue outlook, which primarily came in financial services and carries a very high flow through to margin. The remainder is largely the result of the two items I mentioned earlier and the third quarter benefited from a reduction in variable cash compensation that was partially offset by the incremental reserve related to our settlement with the CFPB. We also expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.72, a range of down 8% to 14%. Turning to the full year. We expect approximately 1 point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA and we expect less than 1 point of impact from M&A. We expect revenue in between $3.794 billion and $3.809 billion or up 2% to 3% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis and up about 2%, excluding the impact of mortgage. The roughly $53 million reduction at the midpoint of our full year revenue expectation is comprised of $9 million from weaker mortgage inquiries and $6 million of FX headwinds, with the remainder largely as a result of the softening trends in consumer lending, insurance and Neustar. For our business segments, we expect US markets to grow low single digits and flat excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be flat and down low single digits, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digits. We anticipate that international will grow low double digits in constant currency terms, driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets. And we continue to expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.32 billion and $1.333 billion, down 1% to 2%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being down 130 to 150 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS being down 9% to 11%. And we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $520 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control in subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $270 million for the full year, down slightly as a result of our continued debt prepayments and we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. Finally, given the current level of uncertainty about the global economy, we believe it is prudent to withdraw the 2025 financial targets that we provided in mid-March of 2022. Clearly, a lot has changed in the macro backdrop since our Investor Day in March of 2022. However, we remain as bullish as ever about our long-term prospects, the value of our expanded product portfolio and our ability to outgrow our underlying markets. We intend to reestablish new targets when we have greater visibility into the trajectory of the global economy. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up, the third quarter proved to be more challenging than expected and conditions deteriorated as it progressed. But despite these headwinds, we delivered growth from our diversified portfolio and we remain focused on delivering a good 2023. We continue to execute against our strategy and we're proactively driving new revenue opportunities, investing in our business, managing our cost structure and maintaining our capital discipline. We remain highly confident in the long-term performance and potential of our business, and we're taking all the necessary steps to deliver the best possible results for shareholders. Now let me turn the time over to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks today. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. Operator, we can begin the Q&A session now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous.\nKelsey Zhu: Chris, I was wondering if you can help us understand the Neustar revenue mix a little bit better in terms of what percentage of Neustar revenue comes from subscription versus usage based revenue across marketing, fraud and communications?\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure. Aaron, you want to...\nAaron Hoffman: So Kelsey, so 80% roughly of the marketing portion of Neustar is subscription-based. Marketing is about 40% of the total. So 80% of 40 is about 32. So about a third of total Neustar is -- would be truly subscription based revenue.\nChris Cartwright: And look, let's take this opportunity to talk about Neustar's performance in the third quarter. As you know, it was one of the leading growth areas at 7% organic year-over-year, which we feel is especially strong given the overall difficult macro conditions that we discussed in our prepared commentary. That said, we were expecting higher growth out of Neustar. We were expecting roughly 10% organic growth over the second half of the year. And what we experienced -- well, just to break down the piece parts, when there's a macroeconomic pullback as we've seen in lending and in insurance, it's going to impact various components of our business. It will reduce the number of batch prescreens. It will reduce the number of marketing campaigns, which impacts our audience generation and segmentation and our campaign planning tools. And that's what we experienced. Now the subscription piece of overall Neustar revenue has held up quite well and consistent with the financial expectations that we outlined. So that's a positive. We've also booked exactly what we expected to book at this point in the year and we're trending toward achieving our full bookings targets, which will be a little bit above last year's bookings, which were a record year for Neustar. So the sale of Neustar products across the three lines is positive. Now the mix of what we're selling at Neustar varied from our expectations in that we're selling less data and audience services that are quicker to fulfill and recognize revenue than we expected, and we're selling more effectiveness measurement, which are consulting type projects where the booking takes more time to realize. And so some of the revenue from the bookings pushed out of the third quarter and even out of fourth quarter expectations. So that was one of the components in our guide down for Neustar. And then the third component really rests on the volume of data sales of TruAudience, audience generation in the specific marketing campaign management. And again, that's going to correlate with growth or decline in lending volume and insurance origination. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of the dynamics that underpin Neustar performance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to touch on your comment regarding lending standards that tightened through the course of the quarter. I'm curious if it was across the board in terms of lenders, whether it's regional banks, fintechs or big banks. And if you can talk about any trends across various consumer cycles whether it's subprime versus prime, so just a bit more color around what's happening with lending standards.\nChris Cartwright: So happy to start with some overview on the macro conditions we see across banking. So as the quarter progressed, I think -- well, first, on the positive, unemployment remains low and there is some real wage growth. Although I think the consensus is that the employment market is deteriorating somewhat. That said, the metrics and measures of that, you've got pros and you've got cons. That said, though, the excess in savings that had accumulated on consumer balance sheets declined a lot and recently the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco suggested that those excess savings balances would be gone by the end of the third quarter and have been gone for some time for all segments of the population, except the most affluent quintile, right? And so over the course of the quarter but really pronounced in September we saw banks becoming more cautious about originating new loans. Now over the past couple of weeks, the large banks, the large publicly traded banks have reported their results, and while they were down a bit they were generally more positive than expectations. The one area, though, that underperformed expectations has been new lending volumes. Now if you tease that apart, the revolving component of new loans is fine, it's the incremental volume to consumers that was most impacted. Now the other dynamic to be aware of in the market, and this really goes back to the earlier part of the year where we had some stability concerns. There was a flight of deposits upmarket to larger institutions that were perceived as more stable. And so in this recent round of earnings, you see that those banks, while they're performing well, it's driven by net interest income growth but the lending activity is down. When you look at the performance of mid-market banks in smaller banks, the pinch on new credit origination is quite pronounced. And we see that in our numbers because -- I mean, obviously, lending is a big part of our portfolio and we serve banks -- traditional banks of all sizes in fintech, of course, as well, we got the largest share there, and we're just seeing a pullback in lending volumes. And when banks become more cautious, that's going to reduce the number of batch prescreens that we produce, it's going to reduce the credit pools that happen, and it's going to reduce the marketing planning. And so it's really this macro retreat that we've seen in the lending that's impacting the business fundamentals.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler of Baird.\nJeff Meuler: So I know Chris had more details to come on accelerating structural expense in efficiency programs. But just anything else you can talk to regarding how much opportunity there is to adjust the expense structure to a weaker volume environment? And I caught the decremental margins and the incentive comp adjustment in Q3, but the Q4 margins and implied decremental margins in Q4 still seem really weak. And I'm just trying to understand if that's more a function of time to implement the new programs or just how we can think through like incremental margins going forward if the volume environment remains [weak] for a while. Sorry for the long question.\nChris Cartwright: So listen, it's a good question and there are several things to unpack in it. The first I would say is -- and we purposely included our year-over-year revenue growth rates in each month in the quarter, so you can appreciate how materially volumes fell in September in lending origination and also insurance, right? So we've had a revenue drop very recently without much time to adjust the expense structure, right? And so over the past 18 months as our markets have progressively slowed we've been proactively managing the expenses. It starts with the easy things of reducing travel and entertainment of cutting external consulting, if you will, reducing marketing. And of course, being very judicious about headcount. So we decelerated new hires and then we've been in somewhat of a hiring freeze and not filling backfills, and all of that has allowed us to kind of proactively adjust the expense structure in a softening revenue environment and maintain our strong margins. But again, there will be some work that we need to do to balance the cost structure against the current revenue environment and you can count on us to do what is necessary. But in my comments, I was really referring to the benefit of the global operating model that we implemented roughly three years ago, where we have been progressively increasing the proportion of our employees that are in centers of excellence that are located in attractive talent markets that can reduce our cost structure over time. Now we've moved to roughly one third of total TransUnion employees operating over those markets. That said, there's still more opportunity as we evolve toward what we'd say, the ideal balance, both in terms of total employees and the management structure, what functions are being led over that. And we're going to continue to push on that dimension because it will have a material impact on our structural profitability. Additionally, we've centralized all of the operational support functions for our different credit businesses. We will be able to streamline and balance our costs against our volumes more effectively by leveraging that. The other point I wanted to make, though, is in our technology journey. We've been investing to migrate to the cloud via project Rise. We've taken a significant proportion of our applications. We've also digested all of the Neustar technology that came and we begun leveraging the core Neustar platform, OneID, which we now call OneTru as a destination for our various data product platforms globally. What you'll see us do now is accelerate our efforts to consolidate the multiple and redundant platforms we have on this next generation and very technologically advanced platform, which is going to let us take a lot of technology costs out. So there'll be a strong focus on that. And finally, we've got to complete the work on acquisition integration. We continue to do really well on that front. We're highly confident we're going to take $80 million out of the Neustar cost structure. We'll get some benefit going forward from the full realization of those synergies. And we're going to hit our integration takeouts for Argus and Sontiq as well. So really think about cost management along those dimensions. Yes, there's been a drop in revenue, it takes some time to correct the cost structure, but there's also a lot of structural benefits in the pipeline that we're going to accelerate and there will be margin improvements as a result of acquisition integration.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: I think you talked about bringing out a new fraud platform today. I just wanted to see within Neustar, is fraud still about a quarter of the business? And then strategically, I wanted to know on the -- again, this is on the fraud side, how you've done an integrated Neustar with iovation and TLO or is that really kind of part of the next reiteration of fraud?\nChris Cartwright: So the Neustar risk or fraud business is roughly 20% of their total revenue. Communications would be the largest, it grew quite nicely, low double digits in the quarter and marketing grew high single digits in the quarter. We just expected it to grow much faster. Risk didn't grow very much, right? It grew low single digits, and it's really because of the impact we see on the risk volumes that are coming through call centers and online. And look, our contracts are volume bounded. And when we budget or set expectations, we're assuming a certain degree of up charges because of volume excess. That just didn't happen this quarter, we believe it's tied to the softening macro conditions. Now in terms of platforms and the next generation of this, look, fraud is a substantial part of our business. We have multiple fraud products and platforms in the US. When we acquired CallCredit, we got another set of attractive, although largely duplicative fraud solutions in the UK market. Then when we bought Neustar where we got a variety of risk point solutions but we also got a great platform in OneID upon which we can unify all of these different fraud mitigation products, on a common data repository with orchestration and advanced analytics in machine learning and AI. We have been working for really since the outset of the acquisition to accomplish all of that technical work. We launched that version of the product in the early part of next year. Now you can think of that as like an advanced beta launch with friendly customers. but it's going to allow us to do two things. One, it is truly a platform of the future. It's next generation. It's a global consolidation of all of our point solutions and it can be leveraged across the globe, right? So we're very excited about that, and it should allow us to accelerate growth in this important product category. It's also going to allow us to retire all of the legacy cost structures, whether it's the variety of solutions in the UK or it's iovation, or it's the legacy solutions here in TransUnion in Chicago.\nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Balsky of Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I was hoping you could just dive in a little bit more on your emerging vertical segment. Just given the changes that you made in the tenant screening part of the business and what you're seeing in insurance, can you just help us kind of think about what you need to see for those sales to accelerate and kind of visibility in the near term?\nChris Cartwright: So I mean, look, from a first principles basis, we've talked about the diversification we've achieved in our portfolio because of our investments in recent times. And even though this is a difficult quarter in a challenging macro period, you can see some of those benefits coming to the fore. Old TransUnion would be reporting results based on US credit sales only, and those would be negative. We've got 4% growth happening in the emerging markets, although not all cylinders are firing any emerging as you point to, right? But we are benefiting from some offset there. Now look, insurance, typically, in normal conditions, is a high single digit grower and our sales have continued to be strong in insurance. The problem that we're seeing and it's what we've been discussing and the industry has been discussing is that risk isn't priced appropriately right now and insurers are reluctant to ramp up their underwriting engines. And so they're increasing their prices a lot upon renewal and they're walking away from some consumer risk in some jurisdiction or geographical risk. Now it takes some time for those unfulfilled policies, if you will, to trickle down in the ecosystem, some go to smaller carriers, some go to nonstandard carriers, some go unfulfilled, right? And as I mentioned, the revenue dynamics is upstream, we've got greater penetration of the full suite of our products. So we're realizing a higher data payload per origination for policy origination. So insurance is going to remain soft for a bit. Now the carriers are working hard to correct that. They continue to push for approvals, for higher rates and I think that will be successful over time, but right now, they're cautious. Tenant deployment screening is undergoing a bit of a reset because of regulatory scrutiny, which led to the settlement that we announced with the CFPB around our renter screening business. And what happened there is the current leadership of the CFPB believes that certain categories of information around evictions and even criminal records should not be used in tenant screening or should only be used in a certain way at a certain point in time. Now that is a different interpretation of the SCRA and it defers materially from historic industry practices. But in working with the CFPB, we've had to adjust the data that we provide. And when we provide it in accordance with their views and we've done that in our tenant employment screening business. And the CFPB and the FTC in particular have been very clear. They've said, with this change of practice and with this settlement, this TU reset, if you will, expresses the new standard for the industry. Now we expect the other rental screeners and their clients who will now have regulatory risk to begin adjusting their practices. So that's in large part why tenant hasn't provided the growth that it typically would, but we expect it to stabilize and for the growth prospects to improve now that we've got this industry reset.\nTodd Cello: Let me just add on to your question, Heather, because Chris definitely talked about the two verticals where we have the most challenge, but I think we'd be remiss to not point out that we have had some success as well in the emerging verticals. In particular, the media vertical grew double digits. And as Chris already said, we expected something greater than that. But nevertheless, in this environment, we posted some pretty strong results in that business. And it was on the back of some significant wins with the Neustar marketing capabilities. And just to remind you, Chris talked about those in his prepared remarks. So that's a big deal for us as well. Our public sector vertical also grew very strong double digits. And we saw growth in what we refer to as services collections as well as tech, commerce and communications. In those areas, in particular, what we are seeing a really nice benefit from is our trusted call solutions also from Neustar. The revenue is up significantly across those verticals.\nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: You mentioned in the prepared remarks that September trends had been getting -- got a lot worse. I wanted to ask about sort of the early October trends, just given rates started to move quicker. Did you see it getting worse or just continuing on sort of at the pace that you are seeing in September?\nTodd Cello: So I think to start on this one is where the best place to go is just the beginning of the third quarter. And I would say July and August were months that were okay,t hey were tracking to the guidance that we have provided on our earnings call in late July. Unfortunately, we saw a sudden shift of lending volumes, as Chris has already articulated in September. And that impacted just to reiterate, in consumer lending, card, mortgage and insurance and the media coming in a little bit lower than what we had expected. So as we looked out into the fourth quarter to prepare our guide for the remainder of the year, we took that sudden reduction that we experienced in September and we rolled that forward. We also looked at where we were at up until last week in October and where volumes were at. And what we feel like we have done is we've taken this rather weak environment and we have thoroughly derisked the Q4 guide with the numbers that we have put out today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: I just wanted to clarify whether the CFPB settlement, whether that's included within the adjusted EBITDA, and if you could quantify how much was it in third quarter or fourth quarter? Because the question we're getting from investors is the revenue at the high -- at the midpoint of the fiscal year '23 revenue guidance was lowered by $54 million, but the EBITDA was lower by $78 million. Why was the EBITDA so much like -- EBITDA guidance lowered significantly more than the revenue guidance, is that due to CFPB settlement?\nTodd Cello: So Ashish, you got two questions there for us this morning. So let me take the first one as it pertains to the CFPB. We settled two matters with the CFPB and one pertains to the FTC, and that was our rental screening settlement that Chris has talked about, that was for $15 million. And then on the security freeze matter, we settled for $8 million for a total of $23 million. All of those settlements have been reserved for within our adjusted EBITDA not as an add back coming into the quarter with the exception of $7 million. And in my prepared remarks, I made reference to that. So there was an incremental aspect of $7 million in the quarter that we did not have in our guidance. So the other amount was already accrued for and had impacted adjusted EBITDA. So the second question is pertaining to our Q4 adjusted EBITDA outlook and why the change. If you look at revenue compared to our prior guide and why EBITDA is a little bit greater than that. And if it goes back to the question that Toni just asked about what the trends in September and our Q4 guide, so it really starts with the revenue and the revenue that we saw suddenly fall off in late September is more of our core credit type of products that carry a higher margin. And so that is what we have taken down. What that's been offset by is growth that we've seen in products such as the trusted call solutions, which I just referred to, that while still at a very attractive margin relative even to TransUnion's adjusted EBITDA margin is one that is at a lower margin than the core credit products carry. So when you take that mix together, you end up with a situation where the profit expectation ends up being greater than what the revenue takedown is.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, I think that's an important dynamic to appreciate. I mean you'll see in our financial disclosure that our cost structure remain the same, it's not a cost issue quarter-to-quarter, it's a revenue mix issue. And so when we confirmed our guide in July, based on the lending trends that we've seen, we simply expected to sell more credit products than we actually ended up selling and credit products have a very, very high flow through to profit. But as I've discussed, we had to retrieve volumes in lending, which reduced credit products. In the parts of the portfolio that performed best have a lower contribution margin, things like our mortgage credit because of the [Technical Difficulty] score and trusted call solutions because of license data costs.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik of Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I was just hoping we could talk to all your fintech exposures, please. So just in the UK, like what was it, I suppose, as a percentage of revenues and exactly what led to the write-down? And then maybe what the US exposure is and if there's any kind of risk we should consider there as well?\nChris Cartwright: Well, let me just start fintech generally, Manav, and you and I have talked about this before. We have a very large and leading share in fintech and that is true both in the US and also in the UK. And fintech has been materially impacted in the downturn because of rising rates and also tightening lending standards. So that's already had an impact and that's already incorporated in our third quarter results but also our thinking about the fourth quarter guide, which Todd just articulated. Now shifting to our UK business and the write-down in goodwill. If you recall, we acquired the business in 2018. It was a low double digit grower then, but it was not particularly profitable. So we took cost action, which slowed revenue growth for about six months. By the time we exited '19, we posted 9% organic growth and the exit quarter was back to low double digit. And that was our expectation, high single, low double digit that underpinned the assessment of book value and the amount of goodwill that we put on the balance sheet. Well, from that point forward, the UK market has been buffeted by a series of macro issues. The first is that the regulators in the UK decided to put pressure on small dollar unsecured lenders. We would call them payday lenders here, some of them were online, they call them the money lenders in the UK. Well, call credit had a disproportionate share of that marketplace. It was a foundational component of their business. So first, we had to adjust to that contraction, which we did and we compensated for it by pushing further upstream into the core and mainstream lending market and taking share, which we did. The next impact came from Brexit and then COVID and then all of that together seems to have fueled some high rates of inflation and increasing unemployment in the UK, which has made it a very difficult lending environment, which continues to impact the fintechs. So after digesting all of this and looking back at the growth rates that we expect, the one that we've achieved but also that we can expect in the intermediate period given the condition of that economy, we thought it was prudent to take the charge to goodwill that we did in the quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: I heard quite a bit about some of the strengths and weaknesses within core credit in the US, I just wanted to ask maybe more directly on market share there. It seems like most of the rationale to this point is tied to end market weakness or end market dynamics. Is there anything that you can say about kind of competitive positioning or competitive successes in that market and how much conviction you have that you're still growing share there?\nChris Cartwright: As we look at it, we don't believe it's a share issue, it's an issue more of business comparability at this point. As many of you have noted, the portfolios of the three bureaus have diverged over time. Some are more focused on direct-to-consumer, some of them are more focused on employment and income and then TransUnion has a very large share, arguably leading market share in the US, providing services to lenders and insurers that want to originate loans and policies. There's also a question of what's reported in the various segments and kind of the surgery you've got to do to get a true comparison. One example is that we report batch marketing services within our US vertical, not everybody does. We separate direct-to-consumer, some people include that. We don't have commercial data and given the size of our lending business overall, the benefits in mortgage of a significant price increase from a third-party score provider gets diluted a bit over our larger market share and lending base than with other players in the space. And so as we compare and evaluate our own performance, you got to consider those differences in what's included as well as the varying size of the respective positions. But no, we don't think share has really anything to do with this and we're not really pointing anything to the positive or the negative.\nAaron Hoffman: Great. And given the time is we're on a busy earnings day, we are going to end our call at this point. We thank you all for joining us. this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you either later this week or over the course of the quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 3% on a reported and constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and immaterial FX impact. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased 5% on a reported basis and 4% in constant currency. This result was negatively impacted by an incremental $7 million charge for the recent legal settlements above the amount we previously reserved. We also benefited from a reversal of accruals for variable cash compensation to account for our current view of revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.8%, up 50 basis points compared to the year ago third quarter and improved sequentially by 180 basis points from the second quarter of 2023. Third quarter adjusted diluted EPS declined 2% as a result of higher interest expense. Finally, we took a $495 million impairment to our UK business during the quarter. This remains an attractive market and business for TransUnion with a highly diversified portfolio, an array of successful product offerings like TruVision and TruEmpower and an adjusted EBITDA margin over 40%. Leveraging our innovation, we've gained meaningful share across the lending ecosystem and delivered market leading growth under our ownership. However, the UK has faced an unusually harsh confluence of macro events resulting in inflationary pressures and soaring interest rates which has slowed the underlying lending growth. Before I get into US markets results, a reminder that we are reporting Neustar revenue within our Vertical market structure and we will discontinue providing stand-alone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023. Now looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. US markets revenues were up 2% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for US markets increased 2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was flat at 35.2%. Financial Services revenue was flat. Consumer lending revenue declined 9% compared to single digit growth in the third quarter of 2022. Absolute lending [volumes] remain healthy as unsecured personal loans have become a mainstream product for our consumers. With that said, marketing activity remains depressed. Rising rates have weighed on consumer demand and capital funding continues to be highly selective. Our credit card business was down 5% compared to low double-digit growth in the year ago quarter with marketing down mid-teens. Issuers continue to react to rising delinquencies by moderating marketing spend. With that said, like with consumer lending, activity levels for card remain healthy on a historical basis. Our auto business delivered 6% growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, pricing, strong prequalification volumes, the impact of cross-selling Neustar marketing and call center solutions. We are seeing strong demand for new vehicles, somewhat offset by continued weakness in the used vehicle market and challenges around affordability. For mortgage, revenue was up 26% in the quarter despite inquiry volumes falling about 21%. As Chris pointed out, growth slowed considerably over the course of the quarter as mortgage rates jumped to 20 year highs in recent weeks. Existing home sales reached their lowest level since 2011 and applications in mid-October fell to their lowest point since 1995. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 7% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 30% and our revenue to increase roughly 15%. Let me now turn to our Emerging Verticals, which grew 4% in the quarter. Insurance delivered low single-digit growth despite the challenges that Chris described. Even in this environment, we continue to win new business for innovative products like TruVision driving history, which has grown fivefold over the past five years. Penetration of newer markets like life and commercial auto and successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tenant and employment screening was down as we've recalibrated our solutions to provide the most customer and consumer friendly approach possible. This has cost us some volume in the short term but we believe it will ultimately be a long-term competitive advantage. The public sector, media and tech, retail and e-commerce verticals all delivered strong growth, highlighting the value of our diversified business and in particular the benefits of integrating Neustar solutions into existing TransUnion end markets to enhance growth. The telco vertical was down slightly as declines in landline caller ID offset growth in other areas like trusted call solutions. Consumer Interactive revenue declined 3% in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 50.4%, up about 80 basis points as a result of more focused advertising spending. Our direct business continues to see moderating declines as we recalibrated our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we've seen good returns on the revamped tactics with better than expected customer acquisition stats at attractive cost to acquire. Our indirect business was flat as lenders have pulled back on utilizing offer aggregators and other channels for marketing, like the trends we're experiencing in our financial services vertical. Our breach and identity protection offerings built through our acquisition of Sontiq, continued to deliver good growth. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 11% with three of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.3%, up about 95 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, our largest international market, we grew 31%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets as well as from fraud, marketing and direct to consumer offerings. We continue to expect India to deliver another year of over 30% growth. In the UK, revenue declined 4%. Excluding revenue related to onetime contracts included with the UK government, we would have declined 2%. While the UK fintech market continues to be challenged, the rest of our business is growing despite the challenged macro environment with good growth in banking driven by share gains and traction with products like TruVision and CreditView as well as strong performance in insurance and gaming. Our Canadian business grew 17% in the third quarter. While the market remains low growth, we have generated strong outperformance across our portfolio and continue to win new share in financial services, fintech insurance and direct-to-consumer. In Latin America, revenue was up 3% with healthy online performance offset by a decline in batch marketing activity. Brazil was down in the quarter as we've seen some weakness in the fintech market. While macro conditions softened across Latin America, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, insurance, government and telcos. In Asia Pacific, we grew 12% from continued good performance in Hong Kong and very strong growth in Philippines where we continue to add new offerings and win new business. Finally, Africa increased 8% based on a broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region despite a challenging macroeconomic and social environment in several of our largest markets. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.4 billion of debt after prepaying another $75 million in the quarter, that left us with $421 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.7 times. We have now prepaid $225 million of debt in 2023 and at this point, we intend to prepay additional debt in the fourth quarter. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.5 billion of debt. We're in the midst of refinancing our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A that matures on December 10, 2024. Based on early indications, we expect a favorable outcome and we will update you when we complete this transaction. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not in our plans this year. We are focused on integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect FX to be insignificant to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $917 million and $932 million or up 2% to 3% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 2 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% on an organic constant currency basis. We are reducing our revenue assumption considerably from that implied in our previous guidance. We have essentially extrapolated the difficult September results across the fourth quarter to better match the current trends in our business. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $303 million and $315 million, down 2% to 6%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 180 to 260 basis points. I want to spend a minute on the sequential change quarter-over-quarter in our adjusted EBITDA expectations. The high end of our fourth quarter is $41 million lower than the actual result for the third quarter. More than three quarters of that change is a result of the reduced revenue outlook, which primarily came in financial services and carries a very high flow through to margin. The remainder is largely the result of the two items I mentioned earlier and the third quarter benefited from a reduction in variable cash compensation that was partially offset by the incremental reserve related to our settlement with the CFPB. We also expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.67 and $0.72, a range of down 8% to 14%. Turning to the full year. We expect approximately 1 point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA and we expect less than 1 point of impact from M&A. We expect revenue in between $3.794 billion and $3.809 billion or up 2% to 3% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis and up about 2%, excluding the impact of mortgage. The roughly $53 million reduction at the midpoint of our full year revenue expectation is comprised of $9 million from weaker mortgage inquiries and $6 million of FX headwinds, with the remainder largely as a result of the softening trends in consumer lending, insurance and Neustar. For our business segments, we expect US markets to grow low single digits and flat excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be flat and down low single digits, excluding mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digits. We anticipate that international will grow low double digits in constant currency terms, driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets. And we continue to expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.32 billion and $1.333 billion, down 1% to 2%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being down 130 to 150 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS being down 9% to 11%. And we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%, depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $520 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control in subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $270 million for the full year, down slightly as a result of our continued debt prepayments and we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. Finally, given the current level of uncertainty about the global economy, we believe it is prudent to withdraw the 2025 financial targets that we provided in mid-March of 2022. Clearly, a lot has changed in the macro backdrop since our Investor Day in March of 2022. However, we remain as bullish as ever about our long-term prospects, the value of our expanded product portfolio and our ability to outgrow our underlying markets. We intend to reestablish new targets when we have greater visibility into the trajectory of the global economy. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Let me just add on to your question, Heather, because Chris definitely talked about the two verticals where we have the most challenge, but I think we'd be remiss to not point out that we have had some success as well in the emerging verticals. In particular, the media vertical grew double digits. And as Chris already said, we expected something greater than that. But nevertheless, in this environment, we posted some pretty strong results in that business. And it was on the back of some significant wins with the Neustar marketing capabilities. And just to remind you, Chris talked about those in his prepared remarks. So that's a big deal for us as well. Our public sector vertical also grew very strong double digits. And we saw growth in what we refer to as services collections as well as tech, commerce and communications. In those areas, in particular, what we are seeing a really nice benefit from is our trusted call solutions also from Neustar. The revenue is up significantly across those verticals. So I think to start on this one is where the best place to go is just the beginning of the third quarter. And I would say July and August were months that were okay,t hey were tracking to the guidance that we have provided on our earnings call in late July. Unfortunately, we saw a sudden shift of lending volumes, as Chris has already articulated in September. And that impacted just to reiterate, in consumer lending, card, mortgage and insurance and the media coming in a little bit lower than what we had expected. So as we looked out into the fourth quarter to prepare our guide for the remainder of the year, we took that sudden reduction that we experienced in September and we rolled that forward. We also looked at where we were at up until last week in October and where volumes were at. And what we feel like we have done is we've taken this rather weak environment and we have thoroughly derisked the Q4 guide with the numbers that we have put out today. So Ashish, you got two questions there for us this morning. So let me take the first one as it pertains to the CFPB. We settled two matters with the CFPB and one pertains to the FTC, and that was our rental screening settlement that Chris has talked about, that was for $15 million. And then on the security freeze matter, we settled for $8 million for a total of $23 million. All of those settlements have been reserved for within our adjusted EBITDA not as an add back coming into the quarter with the exception of $7 million. And in my prepared remarks, I made reference to that. So there was an incremental aspect of $7 million in the quarter that we did not have in our guidance. So the other amount was already accrued for and had impacted adjusted EBITDA. So the second question is pertaining to our Q4 adjusted EBITDA outlook and why the change. If you look at revenue compared to our prior guide and why EBITDA is a little bit greater than that. And if it goes back to the question that Toni just asked about what the trends in September and our Q4 guide, so it really starts with the revenue and the revenue that we saw suddenly fall off in late September is more of our core credit type of products that carry a higher margin. And so that is what we have taken down. What that's been offset by is growth that we've seen in products such as the trusted call solutions, which I just referred to, that while still at a very attractive margin relative even to TransUnion's adjusted EBITDA margin is one that is at a lower margin than the core credit products carry. So when you take that mix together, you end up with a situation where the profit expectation ends up being greater than what the revenue takedown is."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions we're facing and the impact that they had on our business in the third quarter. Then I'll provide an overview of our third quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress we're making with Neustar, accelerating revenue growth and achieving savings targets. I'll wrap up with a short discussion about our approach to managing through a more challenging and uncertain macro environment. Finally, Todd will detail our third quarter results, along with our fourth quarter and full year guidance. Economic conditions softened across several TransUnion markets in the third quarter, most notably in the US and the UK. While US consumers continue to benefit from low unemployment and modest real wage growth, lingering inflation and rising borrowing costs have taken a toll on household finances. Spending has slowed and consumers have largely spent through the excess savings accumulated during COVID. Although demand for credit remains strong despite elevated costs, banks have tightened lending standards due to weakening consumer finances and increasing capital constraints. Recent commentary from lenders supports these observations, noting that cracks have appeared across consumer lending, especially in the lower credit tiers. Now TransUnion entered the third quarter cautiously optimistic after exceeding guidance in the first two quarters, while maintaining our full year guidance as a cushion against ongoing economic uncertainty. However, lending volumes in the US and UK softened progressively over the third quarter, causing our revenues to come in slightly under the low end of our guidance. In US Financial Services, year-over-year revenue grew 3% in July and 1% in August, but declined 5% in September. Rising rates in the quarter had a negative impact as the 10-year treasury rate spiked 50 basis points after only increasing 20 basis points in the first half of the year. The decrease in loan demand combined with tighter credit standards also fueled a pullback in marketing activity, which negatively affected our consumer audience and campaign management volumes. We experienced a similar slowdown in our insurance vertical where carriers remain primarily focused on increasing profitability and have reduced marketing to acquire new customers. Insurance revenue grew 5% in July, 4% in August, but declined 4% in September. Increasing policy renewal rates and carriers exiting unprofitable geographies is fueling increased consumer shopping, which only partially offsets the decline in marketing volumes. And while policy attrition from large carriers is often acquired by smaller and nonstandard carriers, TU typically realizes less revenue per transaction as smaller carriers usually do not utilize our full product suite. Financial Services and insurance volumes have a high flow through to profits and their softening has weighed on our adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin. Our International segment continues to benefit from healthy economic conditions in India and Asia Pacific and strong market outperformance in Canada. Other parts of the portfolio, such as the UK, Latin America and Africa slowed over the quarter, although segment revenues in total were up low double digits. In the third quarter, TransUnion grew revenues 3% organically driven by strength in international, Neustar and several verticals within US emerging markets. US markets grew 2% with Financial Services flat and Emerging Verticals up 4% in total due to high single digit revenue growth in Neustar. Our bookings remained strong overall, including within Financial Services insurance and media, and we continue to benefit from our portfolio diversification as we grew double digits in public sector and media and high single digits in tech, retail and e-commerce, all areas of recent organic and inorganic investment. Revenue in our International segment grew by 11% in constant currency in September for the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 31% revenue growth while Canada and APAC also grew revenues double digits. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of solution innovation, share gains and expansion into new adjacencies. We prepaid another $75 million of debt during the quarter, bringing our total for the first nine months to $225 million, and we expect to make further prepayments in the fourth quarter. We also settled two legal matters with the CFPB and the FTC with no admission of wrongdoing. We're pleased to have resolved these matters and to proceed with our work of providing important business services to help consumers reach their goals. Neustar delivered 7% revenue growth in the quarter despite increased macroeconomic headwinds and is proving to be nicely accretive to our growth rates in our core US verticals, even in these challenging market conditions. While bookings and subscriptions continued their strong growth, Neustar's transactional revenues in Marketing and Risk Solutions softened in the quarter. As a result, we're reducing our fourth quarter growth assumptions in line with volumes in September and lowering our full year guide to mid single digits growth instead of high single digits. We also expect a 31% EBITDA margin, up around 450 basis points over 2022 as we complete integration and achieve our target cost synergies. Now in the quarter, we announced a number of new partnerships that further support our confidence in Neustar's growth prospects. In marketing, we signed a substantial multiyear identity deal with a large CPG company as well as new business with a large apparel company in a major personal care brand. We also announced that our Marketing Solutions business through audience will integrate its identity product line with AWS entity resolution from Amazon Web Services. TruAudience brings advanced identity resolution capabilities to AWS customers to improve their data hygiene and customer insights from within AWS' secure cloud environment. Communications Solutions continue to grow on the strength of our suite of trusted -- of TruContact trusted call solutions or TCS, which grew about 70% in the third quarter across a range of verticals. We recently expanded our relationship with one of the three major wireless carriers in the US to become their exclusive provider for branded calling, part of our TCS solutions suite. Branded calling allows users to place their brand and call purpose on outbound calls to cut through the fog of anonymous robo calls and securely engage with clients and prospects. We also won a multiyear multimillion dollar with a large federal government agency to provide branded call display. We're enjoying strong growth in our TCS solutions and broad interest across our verticals as clients value improved answer rates and reduce costs. Now I want to wrap up my part of the call by reinforcing our long-term approach to creating shareholder value even as macroeconomic and lending market conditions may cycle. We're focused on helping our customers address their current market challenges by applying our complementary credit, marketing and fraud solutions through our insight-led consultative approach. With tightening lending standards, declining loan volumes and rising delinquencies, our rich trended and alternative credit data and powerful analytics and modeling tools will help lenders maximize their portfolios and find attractive segments for growth. Our marketing solutions enable customers to optimize their spending and ensure positive outcomes, which is even more important in challenging conditions. Our identity resolution, audience segmentation and predictive analytics help clients understand which customers to contact, how best to reach them and what messages will most likely resonate. Planning and measuring the effectiveness of marketing spending by utilizing our rich history of pipeline conversion data ensures that the best results are achieved with the least possible investment and our trusted call and fraud mitigation solutions also help clients reach consumers more efficiently and minimize their fraud losses. We continue to invest in the strategic initiatives that will position us for our next chapter of growth and profitability. These include innovations from combining the best of Neustar and TransUnion, launching our next generation fraud mitigation platform and scaling our new products across our thriving international footprint and reducing our cost structurally by scaling our global capability centers, refining our organization structure and standardizing and modernizing our core technologies and operations remains key objectives for TransUnion. Through the series of initiatives, many of which have been in progress for some time now, we believe we can further reduce operating costs materially. Given the more challenging growth environment in which we find ourselves, we are accelerating these efforts and we'll share additional details when appropriate. We also remain laser focused on achieving the cost savings from our acquisition integrations and reducing our interest expense through prepayment of our debt. That concludes my comments this morning on our market conditions, our third quarter performance and our approach to managing through these softer market conditions. Todd will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results and our fourth quarter and our full year 2023 outlook. Over to you, Todd. Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up, the third quarter proved to be more challenging than expected and conditions deteriorated as it progressed. But despite these headwinds, we delivered growth from our diversified portfolio and we remain focused on delivering a good 2023. We continue to execute against our strategy and we're proactively driving new revenue opportunities, investing in our business, managing our cost structure and maintaining our capital discipline. We remain highly confident in the long-term performance and potential of our business, and we're taking all the necessary steps to deliver the best possible results for shareholders. Now let me turn the time over to Aaron. Yes, sure. Aaron, you want to... And look, let's take this opportunity to talk about Neustar's performance in the third quarter. As you know, it was one of the leading growth areas at 7% organic year-over-year, which we feel is especially strong given the overall difficult macro conditions that we discussed in our prepared commentary. That said, we were expecting higher growth out of Neustar. We were expecting roughly 10% organic growth over the second half of the year. And what we experienced -- well, just to break down the piece parts, when there's a macroeconomic pullback as we've seen in lending and in insurance, it's going to impact various components of our business. It will reduce the number of batch prescreens. It will reduce the number of marketing campaigns, which impacts our audience generation and segmentation and our campaign planning tools. And that's what we experienced. Now the subscription piece of overall Neustar revenue has held up quite well and consistent with the financial expectations that we outlined. So that's a positive. We've also booked exactly what we expected to book at this point in the year and we're trending toward achieving our full bookings targets, which will be a little bit above last year's bookings, which were a record year for Neustar. So the sale of Neustar products across the three lines is positive. Now the mix of what we're selling at Neustar varied from our expectations in that we're selling less data and audience services that are quicker to fulfill and recognize revenue than we expected, and we're selling more effectiveness measurement, which are consulting type projects where the booking takes more time to realize. And so some of the revenue from the bookings pushed out of the third quarter and even out of fourth quarter expectations. So that was one of the components in our guide down for Neustar. And then the third component really rests on the volume of data sales of TruAudience, audience generation in the specific marketing campaign management. And again, that's going to correlate with growth or decline in lending volume and insurance origination. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of the dynamics that underpin Neustar performance. So happy to start with some overview on the macro conditions we see across banking. So as the quarter progressed, I think -- well, first, on the positive, unemployment remains low and there is some real wage growth. Although I think the consensus is that the employment market is deteriorating somewhat. That said, the metrics and measures of that, you've got pros and you've got cons. That said, though, the excess in savings that had accumulated on consumer balance sheets declined a lot and recently the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco suggested that those excess savings balances would be gone by the end of the third quarter and have been gone for some time for all segments of the population, except the most affluent quintile, right? And so over the course of the quarter but really pronounced in September we saw banks becoming more cautious about originating new loans. Now over the past couple of weeks, the large banks, the large publicly traded banks have reported their results, and while they were down a bit they were generally more positive than expectations. The one area, though, that underperformed expectations has been new lending volumes. Now if you tease that apart, the revolving component of new loans is fine, it's the incremental volume to consumers that was most impacted. Now the other dynamic to be aware of in the market, and this really goes back to the earlier part of the year where we had some stability concerns. There was a flight of deposits upmarket to larger institutions that were perceived as more stable. And so in this recent round of earnings, you see that those banks, while they're performing well, it's driven by net interest income growth but the lending activity is down. When you look at the performance of mid-market banks in smaller banks, the pinch on new credit origination is quite pronounced. And we see that in our numbers because -- I mean, obviously, lending is a big part of our portfolio and we serve banks -- traditional banks of all sizes in fintech, of course, as well, we got the largest share there, and we're just seeing a pullback in lending volumes. And when banks become more cautious, that's going to reduce the number of batch prescreens that we produce, it's going to reduce the credit pools that happen, and it's going to reduce the marketing planning. And so it's really this macro retreat that we've seen in the lending that's impacting the business fundamentals. So listen, it's a good question and there are several things to unpack in it. The first I would say is -- and we purposely included our year-over-year revenue growth rates in each month in the quarter, so you can appreciate how materially volumes fell in September in lending origination and also insurance, right? So we've had a revenue drop very recently without much time to adjust the expense structure, right? And so over the past 18 months as our markets have progressively slowed we've been proactively managing the expenses. It starts with the easy things of reducing travel and entertainment of cutting external consulting, if you will, reducing marketing. And of course, being very judicious about headcount. So we decelerated new hires and then we've been in somewhat of a hiring freeze and not filling backfills, and all of that has allowed us to kind of proactively adjust the expense structure in a softening revenue environment and maintain our strong margins. But again, there will be some work that we need to do to balance the cost structure against the current revenue environment and you can count on us to do what is necessary. But in my comments, I was really referring to the benefit of the global operating model that we implemented roughly three years ago, where we have been progressively increasing the proportion of our employees that are in centers of excellence that are located in attractive talent markets that can reduce our cost structure over time. Now we've moved to roughly one third of total TransUnion employees operating over those markets. That said, there's still more opportunity as we evolve toward what we'd say, the ideal balance, both in terms of total employees and the management structure, what functions are being led over that. And we're going to continue to push on that dimension because it will have a material impact on our structural profitability. Additionally, we've centralized all of the operational support functions for our different credit businesses. We will be able to streamline and balance our costs against our volumes more effectively by leveraging that. The other point I wanted to make, though, is in our technology journey. We've been investing to migrate to the cloud via project Rise. We've taken a significant proportion of our applications. We've also digested all of the Neustar technology that came and we begun leveraging the core Neustar platform, OneID, which we now call OneTru as a destination for our various data product platforms globally. What you'll see us do now is accelerate our efforts to consolidate the multiple and redundant platforms we have on this next generation and very technologically advanced platform, which is going to let us take a lot of technology costs out. So there'll be a strong focus on that. And finally, we've got to complete the work on acquisition integration. We continue to do really well on that front. We're highly confident we're going to take $80 million out of the Neustar cost structure. We'll get some benefit going forward from the full realization of those synergies. And we're going to hit our integration takeouts for Argus and Sontiq as well. So really think about cost management along those dimensions. Yes, there's been a drop in revenue, it takes some time to correct the cost structure, but there's also a lot of structural benefits in the pipeline that we're going to accelerate and there will be margin improvements as a result of acquisition integration. So the Neustar risk or fraud business is roughly 20% of their total revenue. Communications would be the largest, it grew quite nicely, low double digits in the quarter and marketing grew high single digits in the quarter. We just expected it to grow much faster. Risk didn't grow very much, right? It grew low single digits, and it's really because of the impact we see on the risk volumes that are coming through call centers and online. And look, our contracts are volume bounded. And when we budget or set expectations, we're assuming a certain degree of up charges because of volume excess. That just didn't happen this quarter, we believe it's tied to the softening macro conditions. Now in terms of platforms and the next generation of this, look, fraud is a substantial part of our business. We have multiple fraud products and platforms in the US. When we acquired CallCredit, we got another set of attractive, although largely duplicative fraud solutions in the UK market. Then when we bought Neustar where we got a variety of risk point solutions but we also got a great platform in OneID upon which we can unify all of these different fraud mitigation products, on a common data repository with orchestration and advanced analytics in machine learning and AI. We have been working for really since the outset of the acquisition to accomplish all of that technical work. We launched that version of the product in the early part of next year. Now you can think of that as like an advanced beta launch with friendly customers. but it's going to allow us to do two things. One, it is truly a platform of the future. It's next generation. It's a global consolidation of all of our point solutions and it can be leveraged across the globe, right? So we're very excited about that, and it should allow us to accelerate growth in this important product category. It's also going to allow us to retire all of the legacy cost structures, whether it's the variety of solutions in the UK or it's iovation, or it's the legacy solutions here in TransUnion in Chicago. So I mean, look, from a first principles basis, we've talked about the diversification we've achieved in our portfolio because of our investments in recent times. And even though this is a difficult quarter in a challenging macro period, you can see some of those benefits coming to the fore. Old TransUnion would be reporting results based on US credit sales only, and those would be negative. We've got 4% growth happening in the emerging markets, although not all cylinders are firing any emerging as you point to, right? But we are benefiting from some offset there. Now look, insurance, typically, in normal conditions, is a high single digit grower and our sales have continued to be strong in insurance. The problem that we're seeing and it's what we've been discussing and the industry has been discussing is that risk isn't priced appropriately right now and insurers are reluctant to ramp up their underwriting engines. And so they're increasing their prices a lot upon renewal and they're walking away from some consumer risk in some jurisdiction or geographical risk. Now it takes some time for those unfulfilled policies, if you will, to trickle down in the ecosystem, some go to smaller carriers, some go to nonstandard carriers, some go unfulfilled, right? And as I mentioned, the revenue dynamics is upstream, we've got greater penetration of the full suite of our products. So we're realizing a higher data payload per origination for policy origination. So insurance is going to remain soft for a bit. Now the carriers are working hard to correct that. They continue to push for approvals, for higher rates and I think that will be successful over time, but right now, they're cautious. Tenant deployment screening is undergoing a bit of a reset because of regulatory scrutiny, which led to the settlement that we announced with the CFPB around our renter screening business. And what happened there is the current leadership of the CFPB believes that certain categories of information around evictions and even criminal records should not be used in tenant screening or should only be used in a certain way at a certain point in time. Now that is a different interpretation of the SCRA and it defers materially from historic industry practices. But in working with the CFPB, we've had to adjust the data that we provide. And when we provide it in accordance with their views and we've done that in our tenant employment screening business. And the CFPB and the FTC in particular have been very clear. They've said, with this change of practice and with this settlement, this TU reset, if you will, expresses the new standard for the industry. Now we expect the other rental screeners and their clients who will now have regulatory risk to begin adjusting their practices. So that's in large part why tenant hasn't provided the growth that it typically would, but we expect it to stabilize and for the growth prospects to improve now that we've got this industry reset. Yes, I think that's an important dynamic to appreciate. I mean you'll see in our financial disclosure that our cost structure remain the same, it's not a cost issue quarter-to-quarter, it's a revenue mix issue. And so when we confirmed our guide in July, based on the lending trends that we've seen, we simply expected to sell more credit products than we actually ended up selling and credit products have a very, very high flow through to profit. But as I've discussed, we had to retrieve volumes in lending, which reduced credit products. In the parts of the portfolio that performed best have a lower contribution margin, things like our mortgage credit because of the [Technical Difficulty] score and trusted call solutions because of license data costs. Well, let me just start fintech generally, Manav, and you and I have talked about this before. We have a very large and leading share in fintech and that is true both in the US and also in the UK. And fintech has been materially impacted in the downturn because of rising rates and also tightening lending standards. So that's already had an impact and that's already incorporated in our third quarter results but also our thinking about the fourth quarter guide, which Todd just articulated. Now shifting to our UK business and the write-down in goodwill. If you recall, we acquired the business in 2018. It was a low double digit grower then, but it was not particularly profitable. So we took cost action, which slowed revenue growth for about six months. By the time we exited '19, we posted 9% organic growth and the exit quarter was back to low double digit. And that was our expectation, high single, low double digit that underpinned the assessment of book value and the amount of goodwill that we put on the balance sheet. Well, from that point forward, the UK market has been buffeted by a series of macro issues. The first is that the regulators in the UK decided to put pressure on small dollar unsecured lenders. We would call them payday lenders here, some of them were online, they call them the money lenders in the UK. Well, call credit had a disproportionate share of that marketplace. It was a foundational component of their business. So first, we had to adjust to that contraction, which we did and we compensated for it by pushing further upstream into the core and mainstream lending market and taking share, which we did. The next impact came from Brexit and then COVID and then all of that together seems to have fueled some high rates of inflation and increasing unemployment in the UK, which has made it a very difficult lending environment, which continues to impact the fintechs. So after digesting all of this and looking back at the growth rates that we expect, the one that we've achieved but also that we can expect in the intermediate period given the condition of that economy, we thought it was prudent to take the charge to goodwill that we did in the quarter. As we look at it, we don't believe it's a share issue, it's an issue more of business comparability at this point. As many of you have noted, the portfolios of the three bureaus have diverged over time. Some are more focused on direct-to-consumer, some of them are more focused on employment and income and then TransUnion has a very large share, arguably leading market share in the US, providing services to lenders and insurers that want to originate loans and policies. There's also a question of what's reported in the various segments and kind of the surgery you've got to do to get a true comparison. One example is that we report batch marketing services within our US vertical, not everybody does. We separate direct-to-consumer, some people include that. We don't have commercial data and given the size of our lending business overall, the benefits in mortgage of a significant price increase from a third-party score provider gets diluted a bit over our larger market share and lending base than with other players in the space. And so as we compare and evaluate our own performance, you got to consider those differences in what's included as well as the varying size of the respective positions. But no, we don't think share has really anything to do with this and we're not really pointing anything to the positive or the negative."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the TransUnion 2023 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions and TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our strong second quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress with Neustar to accelerate revenue growth and achieve savings targets. And I'll wrap up with a short discussion of our global capability center strategy, which enables us to scale our global business efficiently and tap into diverse talent pools. And finally, Todd will detail our second quarter results, along with our third quarter and full year guidance. Through the second quarter, macroeconomic conditions are unchanged to slightly improve with reduced expectations for a recession in the U.S. In most of our markets globally, consumers continue to face higher interest rates and elevated although moderating inflation levels. This combination will continue to strain household finances, although high employment levels and modest real wage gains have mitigated the impact of these pressures to-date in most of our markets. Consumers remain resilient, and we see positive continued demand for borrowing. In the U.S., we've seen increased caution and tighter lending standards from banks. However, the strong demand for credit continues to be met by a broad range of lenders. U.S. consumers remain healthy and optimistic relative to historical norms with modest spending growth based on strong employment and real wage increases. Credit performance metrics have continued to normalize and remain within range of pre-pandemic and historical levels. Although delinquencies have increased, they're still very comfortable by historic standards across mortgage, card, auto and unsecured personal loans. Across our international portfolio, conditions also remain largely unchanged. In Canada and the UK, consumer health and credit demand continue to be similar to the U.S. with persistently high inflation and rising rates burdening consumers and slowing lending markets. However, lending volumes in our emerging markets of India, Asia-Pacific, South Africa and LatAm remain strong. Like many of our customers, we remain cautious about the rest of 2023. Therefore, we will again maintain our full year guidance at this point to account for market uncertainties despite overachieving in the second quarter. Todd will walk you through the details later of our third quarter and full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals. Now turning to second quarter highlights. We again beat our guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. U.S. markets grew 1% with financial services flat and emerging verticals up 3%. Our financial services vertical performed in line with our expectations, though mortgage was slightly below expectations but offset by modestly better performance in consumer lending. U.S. emerging verticals was also in line with our expectations and improved sequentially from the first quarter. Importantly, we have seen signs that the short-term headwinds we faced in tenant and employment screening and insurance are moderating, which should position us for faster growth in the second half of the year in those verticals. Our International segment grew constant currency revenue by double-digits for the ninth consecutive quarter, led by 35% revenue growth in India and double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Canada. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of market share gains and our industry-leading innovation. Across all our markets, our broad solutions portfolio is resonating with our customers, helping them navigate complex and hard to forecast economic conditions. And as I'll detail in a moment, we continue to make progress integrating Neustar and see strong customer adoption of our platforms and solutions. Also in the quarter, we announced a commercial partnership and a minority investment in Truework, a rapidly emerging player in the income and employment verification market. Truework uses sophisticated orchestration software to support a multipronged strategy to provide coverage of 90% of U.S. employees. We see an attractive opportunity to help bring Truework's unique solutions to our broad customer base in markets like financial services and rental screening, among others. And finally, we continue to direct our free cash flow towards reducing our debt levels. And in the second quarter, we've prepaid another $75 million in debt and intend to make additional prepayments in the second half of the year. We have now prepaid $150 million of debt this year. Moving to Neustar. Neustar delivered 6% organic growth as a result of solid performance across marketing, fraud and communications. For the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit revenue growth and a 32% margin, fueled by profit flow-through on accelerating revenues and attainment of our integration cost savings. We have line of sight to the revenue growth based on our strong bookings and the momentum achieved by joint sales teams aligned by vertical markets. In the first half of the year, we signed meaningful renewals with dozens of customers, including some of the largest companies in the world. We've also begun recognizing revenue on a number of new multimillion dollar contracts that we believe will accelerate growth in the second half. At the same time, we have numerous late-stage large contracts that should further enhance growth over the remainder of the year. Taken together, these wins give us confidence in delivering high-single digit growth for Neustar this year. During the quarter, we also announced a number of partnerships that further underpin our confidence in the short and long-term prospects for Neustar. At Snowflake\u2019s annual user conference, we announced the launch of TruAudience Marketing Solutions Transfer-less Identity Resolution app. It\u2019s now in the Snowflake marketplace. This partnership brings our advanced identity resolution capabilities to shared customers wherever their data and marketing technology lives. Together, we\u2019re helping our customers improve their consumer data quality and collaborate with partners without sharing sensitive customer information. Marketers and publishers want to connect disparate offline and online data and enrich consumer profiles with demographics data from TruAudience Identity Solutions. Using this app, they can do that without transferring data outside the Snowflake environment. The Transfer-less quality of the Native App helps to support security, privacy, and data governance. We also partnered with VideoAmp to release a comprehensive analytics solution for cross-platform media measurement and optimization. Marketers will now have more accurate visibility into the effectiveness of their linear television advertising by integrating VideoAmp\u2019s TV viewership dataset into the TruAudience marketing analytics and attribution solution. This integration enables marketers to better measure the holistic impact of their campaigns across TV and digital channels and to enable data-driven decisions. And we expanded our partnership with Magnite, the world\u2019s largest independent sell side advertising company, increasing their TruAudience data marketplace usage beyond connected TV. Magnite can now help agencies brand and publishers reach audiences across digital media channels, including streaming video, audio, gaming and digital out of home. TransUnion\u2019s TruAudience Data Marketplace offers advertisers and brands audience solutions that cover over 80 million U.S. connected homes. And our communication solutions continue to grow on the strength of our suite of TruContact Trusted Call Solutions or TCS, which grew about 75% in the second quarter. Our teams continue to identify new applications that have resulted in rapid customer adoption across a host of verticals. Let me detail some of the recent progress in two end markets. First, we\u2019ve made inroads into the healthcare sector where TCS can enhance the effectiveness of necessary phone calls at many steps of care, including booking appointments, pre-appointment insurance authorizations, appointment reminders, telehealth phone calls, test results, prescription pickups, and payment notices or reminders. Second, we see opportunities in the public sector. A few weeks ago, we launched TruLookup Veteran Connect to help State Departments of Veterans Affairs improve outreach and effectively deliver housing, healthcare, job training, and other essential support to their members. In this case, TruContact Branded Call Display verifies that the inbound call is coming from the Department of Veterans Affairs and adds context to the mobile call display including brand name, location, logo, and reason for the call. Last quarter, I discussed our ongoing data and technology transformation, which has been supercharged by the Neustar acquisition. This quarter, I want to highlight our Global Capability Centers or GCCs and how they\u2019re enabling our transformation into a truly global organization. Investment in our GCCs in recent years has allowed us to centralize and standardize a variety of important work in high talent and lower cost locations. Today, our GCCs are delivering high quality solutions and services to customers using a follow the sun coverage approach across time zones. We launched our first GCC in 2018, and over the last five years, we\u2019ve grown to more than 4,000 employees across India, South Africa in our newest location Costa Rica. Local GCC associates inject new ideas and energies into our solutions and our processes. Concentrating functions and software development, data science and analytics, operations and business support functions creates scale efficiencies and consolidates knowledge and best practices. And as we grow our market share in the region surrounding the GCCs, we believe their real-time support, regional expertise, and strong local language skills will be critical to supporting our customers. We\u2019ve received numerous rewards reflecting the outstanding work of our GCCs. These include certification as great places to work in India and a top employer in South Africa. And in the last two months, our India GCC was recognized by NASSCOM, the Indian IT Business Process Management Association for its stellar distributed work model for the future, and also named by Everest Group as a top global business services employer in India. This recognition reflects the strong leadership we\u2019ve put in place and the high caliber diverse talent they\u2019ve assembled. We see the growth of our GCC network as another attractive path to margin expansion and improved operational performance in the year to come. Now that wraps up my comments on our market conditions, second quarter performance, progress, integrating Neustar and our successful GCC strategy. Now Todd will provide you with further details on our second quarter financial results and our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. Over to you, Todd.\nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I\u2019ll start off with our consolidated financial results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions as we lap the purchase of Argus last quarter. Foreign exchange was a 1% headwind. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA declined 3% on a reported basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially improved to 35.0% down almost 200 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter, which had the most challenging comparison for 2023. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 13% as a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense. Before I get into U.S. Markets results, a reminder that we are reporting Neustar revenue within our vertical market structure and we will discontinue providing standalone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023. Now looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. Markets revenue was up 1% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Markets declined 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.6%. Financial services revenue was flat. Turning to the individual end markets. Consumer lending revenue declined low-double digits against a high-20% growth rate in the year ago quarter. After pulling back, late last year in response to a potentially weakening consumer, fintechs have stabilized and remain active market participants with reasonable access to funding. We also continued to see strength in the Buy Now Pay Later market. Our credit card business was down mid-single-digits against a high teens growth rate in the prior year quarter. Issuers remain selective on marketing outreach, but continue to originate at a healthy level. We are also benefiting from our relationships with larger firms that are aggressively utilizing digital marketing. Our auto business delivered low-single-digit growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, pricing, strong pre-qualification volumes, the impact of cross-selling, Neustar marketing and call center solutions. We are seeing improving supply of new vehicles somewhat offset by continued weakness in the used vehicle market. For mortgage, revenue was up 16% in the quarter, despite inquiry volumes falling about 29%. Absolute volumes remained weak, but year ago comparisons started to ease with volume declines offset by pricing and strong HELOC activity. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market is stagnated as home prices remain high and existing homeowners are reluctant to leave low rate mortgages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 6.5% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 25% and our revenue to increase roughly 20%. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 3% in the quarter. Insurance delivered another good quarter. Importantly, we are seeing carriers receive approval for rate increases and beginning to pass those increased prices to consumers, which we believe will continue to drive a recovery in shopping activity. At this point, insurers have largely limited their marketing activity to brand oriented campaigns and have yet to substantially reactivate personalized marketing to drive new applications. We also continue to benefit from new business wins, adoption of our innovations like TruVision driving history, growth in newer markets like life and commercial auto, and successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tenant and employment screening was down against tough comps and a softening employment market. However, we continue to see signs of a recovery in the tenant market with month over month declines in rental rates, increases in move rates, and an increasing supply of rental units as new construction comes online. Our media vertical grew in the quarter as a result of continued business wins driven by the combination of TransUnion and Neustar Solutions as Chris described. Finally, we continue to see good growth in services and collections and tech, retail and e-commerce, particularly on the strength of customer wins of our Trusted Call Solutions suite. Consumer interactive revenue declined 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47.0%, up about 80 basis points as a result of more focused advertising spending. Our direct business continues to decline as we recalibrate our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we\u2019ve seen good returns on the revamp tactics with better than expected customer acquisition stats at attractive cost acquire. In our indirect business, we grew in the second quarter on the strength of new business wins, particularly with financial services accounts using TruEmpower, formerly known as our credit view platform, as well as a modest improvement with some of our partners that offer paid monitoring. For my comments about international, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 13% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.3%, down about 100 basis points as a result of strategic investments across our regions. Now let\u2019s dig into the specifics for each region. In India, our largest international market, we grew 35% reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets, as well as from fraud and direct-to-consumer offerings. We expect India to deliver another year of over 30% growth. And with the exception of COVID impact 2020, we have grown this business over 30% every year since 2017. In the UK, revenue declined 1%, excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts, including with the UK government, we would\u2019ve grown about 3% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. While lending markets have softened, we continue to see large banks staying active to satisfy demand even as the fintech market has struggled. The same time, we have seen good performance for our affordability and trended credit solutions to help lenders assess portfolio risk. Our Canadian business grew 11% in the second quarter. While the market remains relatively flat, we have generated strong growth through the execution of share shifts in financial services and fintech as well as a recovery in property and casualty insurance underwriting activity. In Latin America, revenue was up 5% with broad-based growth across the majority of our markets, including another quarter of double-digit growth for our largest market Colombia. Brazil was down in the quarter as we\u2019ve seen some weakness in the fintech market. While macro conditions have softened across Latin America, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintech\u2019s and neo banks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of TruVision trended credit, and our fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 20% from continued good performance in Hong Kong and the Philippines, where we continue to add new offerings and win new business. Finally, Africa increased 10% on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region, despite a challenging macroeconomic and social environment in several of our largest markets. In South Africa, core banking business growth was driven by solid market conditions and new business wins. This growth was augmented by continued strength in fast growing verticals like telco and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in markets like Kenya, Zambia and Rwanda. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.5 billion of debt after pre-paying another $75 million in the quarter that left us with $442 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.8x. We have now prepaid $150 million of debt in 2023 and at this point we continue to intend to prepay additional debt in the second half of the year. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we\u2019ve prepaid about $1.4 billion of debt. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not in our plans this year. We are focused on integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we expect FX to be in significant to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $973 million and $988 million or up 4% to 5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 1.5 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be up 2.5% to 3.5% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $361 million and $370 million, an increase of 6% to 9%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 80 basis points to 110 basis points. We also expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.92 and $0.95, a range of down 1% to up 2%. Turning to the full year. Most of our guidance remains largely unchanged. We expect about 1 point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and we expect less than 1 point of impact from M&A. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis and up 2% to 4% excluding the impact of mortgage. For our business segments, our organic revenue growth outlook also remains unchanged. We expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single-digits, but low-single-digits without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up low-single-digits and down low-single-digits excluding mortgage. While the overall guidance for financial services is unchanged, we have modestly increased our expectations for consumer lending, but reduce them for mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single-digits. You can see the benefits of our diversified portfolio playing out, allowing us to maintain our full year revenue guidance. We anticipate that international will grow low-double-digits in constant currency turns driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets, and we continue to expect consumer interactive to decline low-single-digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion up 3% to 5%, also unchanged. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings partially offset by the inclusion of Argus\u2019 relatively lower margins in the first quarter and some revenue mix considerations. We anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share being flat to declining 4% with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth, and we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $275 million for the full year as the benefits of debt prepayment are offset by an increase in the SOFR forward curve. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we had another good quarter beating our guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We\u2019re prudently holding our full year guidance given the level of uncertainty in the market, at the same time we continue to make meaningful progress integrating Neustar and delivering business wins from the combination. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Aaron.\nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, as always, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. And so now operator, we can begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. So totally respect the prudence and maintaining the guidance. I guess, just in terms of not flowing through the better Q2, and I know you said it\u2019s still a uncertain and tough macro, but you said that\u2019s unchanged to slightly improved. I see the offset in the lower U.S. mortgage revenue and inquiries guidance. Is there anything else that you\u2019re seeing in your business kind of later in the quarter, early in Q3? Or any signals you\u2019re getting from your customers that is showing a pullback in activity or is it just maybe extra conservatism or prudence? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Good morning, Jeff. This is Todd. I\u2019ll take that question and probably a very appropriate place for us to start this morning. So yes, in Q1 and Q2 we did beat expectations across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS and we did not raise the guide. And the reason for that is we feel that the economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. and in some of the developed markets that we operate in, continue to remain uncertain. And as a point to that and how we think about this, if you go back to our April call when we gave our Q1 results and the updated guide at that time we significantly increased our mortgage assumption for the year because we saw a mix shift more towards smaller players in the space. But we reduced our consumer lending forecast for the year close to similar amounts for all intents and purposes. And in the consumer lending space what we were seeing at that time was a slowdown and it was primarily in response to the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature failures. We saw just a cautiousness in the late March, early April period. So what happened is in the second quarter those dynamics that I just articulated that we forecasted in essence we saw almost reverse, we saw interest rates tick up in particular on the 10 year yield, which had a direct impact on mortgage rates where we saw mortgage rates close to 7% not that long ago, still in the upper 6\u2019s. So as a result of that in this guide what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve taken down our mortgage assumption and conversely consumer lending as the second quarter went on and our customers got more and more comfortable with the type of environment that they were operating in, we started to see the consumer lending volumes tick up. So again, kind of a similar offsetting case there. So I think that\u2019s just important because when you look at the full year guide and you see that we maintain, there are puts and takes that we\u2019re seeing in the business and that\u2019s probably the best example I can give you. The thing I would say though is, needless to say is we\u2019re really pleased to have been able to outperform in the first half of the year. And really what we\u2019re focused on is de-risk and the \u2013 de-risking the second half of the year. But with that being said, when you look at the growth rates and the expectations for the second half of the year, we feel that the guide is strong. We feel like we\u2019re going to deliver a good second half. And it really gets to \u2013 point of your question is our customers, we are seeing a stability right now, again, in more of our developed markets. So think of U.S. financial services as well as in markets like Canada and even a little bit in the UK, maybe that\u2019s a little bit more pressured. And the international business continues to grow strongly in the double digits. So that\u2019s what gives us the conviction in the second half.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kelsey Zhu of Autonomous. Go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m very excited about your strategic partnership with Truework. Just trying to understand a little bit better about the size of Truework\u2019s database and revenue as well as your strategy to expand there. I was also wondering if you can share with us a little bit more about what the downstream customer breakdown looks like between kind of mortgage, background screening companies for Truework. And whether you\u2019re usually competing with Equifax and Experian in this space, or are you more competing with some of the in-house manual verification processes at these mortgage lenders? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Okay, Kelsey, thank you for the question. And again, we\u2019re excited about our partnership with Truework\u2019s. I think any discussion of verified employment and income space starts with the context that the work number is setting the standard for product in this marketplace. But it\u2019s a big and attractive adjacent market for us. And I think the investment in Truework just reflects our continued efforts to find our way into this market and scale our revenues. We think the market is hungry for competitive alternatives and we\u2019re one of a number of players that seized the opportunity and we\u2019re going to continue to work to find the right solutions that can satisfy client needs and scale revenues. What we like about Truework is, they are rapidly emerging player in the space and they\u2019re very kind of foot forward technologically. They have sophisticated workflow and orchestration software that\u2019s very easy to access and has a very streamlined user interface that allows customers to fulfill the need through a variety of approaches or mechanisms that could be tapping into their database of employment and income, which is well beyond critical mass and growing from relationships with payroll processors, but also with major corporations. But they can also support a consumer permissioned account access workflow, the traditional telephonic workflow, document upload embedded within the loan origination lifecycle. So the kind of umbrella functionality that they provide across a range of fulfillment methods is particularly attractive. We think we have certainly attractive data assets and very broad distribution MSAs, relationships with the demand side that can help scale this investment. And then to some of your kind of more detailed questions, those are probably better for the Truework\u2019s CEO. But I think this just reinforces our strategic intent to compete in this space and our ongoing efforts to find the right solution to help us penetrate and scale.\nKelsey Zhu: Thanks for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Good morning. I wanted to just go back to the credit market again. And wanted to get your perspective on what you're seeing from fintech customers. And it seems, just from your commentary that maybe marketing revenues seem to have accelerated on the credit side of the equation. So would love to get some perspective on that sort of the puts and takes around marketing versus portfolio monitoring, sort of what you're seeing from your customers broadly and fintech in particular?\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Yes, happy to focus on that. I'd say trading conditions for the fintechs are largely unchanged between the quarters. We see certainly reduced activity from prior years where their growth had really accelerated, but a lot of stability and resilience in the sector. They are still originating loans, albeit at a lower level, and they're more selective than they were previously. I don't think we've seen a distinct shift toward marketing and customer acquisition in either the fintechs or frankly, consumer lending in the broad, right. There is more caution and there's more sensitivity to risk, which has reduced overall marketing and acquisition activity. That said, there's still a good level of lending activity. There are certainly ample consumer appetite for loans because the consumer remains pretty healthy. And as long as that's the case, the market is going to find a way to fulfill that demand. And again, I think it's important again, to provide some context. While in 2022, in the first half of the year, the fintechs in consumer lending in general was booming. We saw that diminish in the second half of the year, and we still have kind of steady as she goes, outlook for fintechs for the remainder of this year. But with that said, the business is still up 75% over the last three years. And we view that as something to be excited about, not concerned about.\nFaiza Alwy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Going back to Slide 6, Neustar. Could you just be a little more specific and tell us what's driving the strong bookings, renewals and usage? And is there a joint product roadmap yet between Neustar and TransUnion?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Happy to elaborate on that. First of all, I would say, across the three product areas of marketing, risk and communications, we've had strong growth in each of those areas, and we are looking to accelerated growth in the third and the fourth quarter to reach the full year high single-digits guide. As I said in my commentary, we had strong renewals with big customers. We are ramping the revenues from big customer wins last year. We continue to sell well. And so there's a lot of positive indicators that give us confidence in that Neustar high single-digit guide. And yes, we absolutely are executing on our cross-sell and on our integrated product development in very meaningful ways. In prior calls, I've talked I think, extensively about the benefits of Neustar's technology. The OneID platform that they developed, which we have adopted and rebranded as OneTRU and is becoming the integrated data acquisition, management and analytics platform for TransUnion across multiple geographies and multiple markets. We'll continue to roll that out. We've firmly proven the concept that we can do it. So yes, the integration is going well on multiple levels. I think on the selling side, we integrated the sales forces in the first year, and they're very comfortable and their knowledge of the broader product line is increasing, and their comfort cross-selling is increasing, and we are seeing improvement. Now clearly under more work to do and a lot of upside there. So we're going to continue to push hard. But we do have integrated product development or multigenerational product plans in each of their product lines between the two companies.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask maybe one more question on the sort of Truework and verification. So ultimately, where do you see this going for you? Is your strategy really to try to compete head-to-head with Equifax now? I know historically, because of being sort of newer and smaller in that part of the business, like you had sort of had this niche strategy. So I guess, what is the new strategy there? And where are the real differentiators that you see for Truework and your combination? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, sure. Again, look, I have to acknowledge that Equifax has a very strong business in the space. We all understand that. However, I think their \u2013 I think the market will support multiple competitors in the space in different niches. And so when you take on a strong and entrenched competitor like this, you're looking for an opportunity to penetrate the market. The market, I think, is hungry for alternatives for a variety of competitive factors. I think it's healthy, for the market I think it's good for consumers. And I think Truework has demonstrated that they have a value proposition that can sell, that they are scaling the business and that the distribution partnership with us is going to be significantly additive to that. So we\u2019re working on growing this beachhead that they\u2019ve established, and we can grow it in a variety of ways from adding records to increasing the distribution to deeper and more meaningful penetration into TransUnion products so they can ride our rails into our clients, et cetera. And we\u2019re just going to continue to fight the fight and there\u2019s really not a strategic change.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to circle back to Neustar maybe a multi-part question here if you will. The first is the 6% growth essentially what you were expecting for the second quarter. And then the second part is just on kind of medium-term growth outlook there. I know the target when you announced the deal was to eventually get to double-digit growth. I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s still the target and to what extent do you need a supportive macro to get there? Thank you.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Well, 6% growth in Neustar in the second quarter is right on plan. And the plan for Neustar over the course of 2023 was accelerating revenues based on the strength of the bookings and the implementations. The bookings from 2022, and the implementations ramping over the course of 2023. And that is playing out as planned. We still expect to get the high-single digits for Neustar in total by the end of the year. Now back to the guidance, the initial guide, yes, indeed, we did expect for the business to be executing in the low-double digit organic revenue range of a couple of years after acquisition. That is still our expectation for the potential of this business over the longer-term. But again, we are facing more challenging conditions overall economically, but certainly in terms of marketing and advertising spend than when we first provided that guidance. So right now, we\u2019re really focused on achieving high-single digit and sustaining that in the foreseeable future.\nTodd Cello: And Chris, I would just add on to that, that just underscore the point that Neustar has performed to our expectations through the first half. And the second point that I think is important to understand is that this business is expected to be the fastest grower in our U.S. Markets business in 2023. So it gets to the question on the growth rates. Chris just said, we fully expect to deliver on the high-single digit. We put 3% growth up in Q1, 6% up in Q2. You can do the math as far as how high-single digits gets there. We have good visibility in the Q3, Q4, and it should be at a higher rate than what you\u2019ve seen.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Those are good adds and too early to guide for 2024. We\u2019re still focused on hitting 2023. The other add I guess is that the integration savings program continues right on target and as we grow revenue and we take costs out of the business, we\u2019re going to progress toward those long-term margin objectives for Neustar as well.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on the EBITDA margin. The 3Q guidance implies a significant improvement both sequentially and year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion, but the implied fourth quarter margins, which are if my math is right around 39%, implies another sequential improvement. And I was wondering if you could talk about the drivers for that improvement. Are there one-time things or is that how we should think about the jump off point as we get into 2024? Thanks.\nTodd Cello: Ashish, thanks for the question. So as far as our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is concerned, let\u2019s just say, I think the appropriate place to start is with our revenue guidance, right? And so if you look at the guide that we put out there obviously maintaining if you look at that from the high end of our guidance range, we are expecting incrementally more dollars to arrive from a revenue perspective in the second half. Seasonality is a big factor of that. So Q3 is typically one of TransUnion\u2019s highest revenue quarters on a historical basis in a normal non-pandemic times. So we \u2013 you can see that in the guide that there\u2019s incremental dollars that are assumed from a revenue perspective and that\u2019s going to drive a nice amount of flow through into our adjusted EBITDA margin. The second thing that I would say is that the Neustar cost synergies that Chris just alluded to in the previous question they continue to build for us and provide a very meaningful benefit. So that\u2019ll definitely be a driver for us as well. And coming of back to the first question that we got just about \u2013 in talking about the uncertainty that we face in the business, in response to that, the organization over the last year plus has prudently managed expenses. And we\u2019ve been focused only on the most critical hires, we\u2019ve pulled back on our travel and entertainment and looked for other one-time spend to be able to pull out of our operating expense run rate. So all of those forces are also in effect as well. And then the final point I would make is, if you think about Chris\u2019 opening remarks and where we covered the Global Capability Centers provides a very meaningful benefit to TransUnion. That\u2019s why we felt it was appropriate to provide that update and a little bit more detail this quarter. So that\u2019s definitely another driver for us as well too.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And I think that\u2019s all spot on. And I think just to amplify that last point, centralizing operations and building out our global capability centers has been a big part of globalizing this company, but also making it structurally more profitable. And that\u2019s why we put a spotlight on the march that we\u2019ve been on for the past five years now. And I \u2013 we think there\u2019s more opportunity. We\u2019re going to stay the course there and take full advantage of it. We also think there\u2019s opportunity and time to become structurally more efficient on the technology side, and as we continue our migration through Project Rise to the cloud with considerable standardization along the way that will then create an opportunity for us to consolidate the tech stack further and produce some further efficiencies there as well. So we\u2019re on a multi-year path here to get our margins back to where they were before the acquisitions, that\u2019s our commitment to investors. And it\u2019s a combination of the near-term things that Todd talked about, but also the strategic backdrop that we\u2019ve been investing in for many years.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s great. Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities. Go ahead.\nAndrew Jeffrey: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m wondering specifically, Chris, in the Trusted Call Solutions part of your business, can you talk about sort of where those wins are coming from? Are they coming from internal solutions? So from whom are you taking share and what are the pricing characteristics of those contracts?\nChris Cartwright: Okay, well, let me shed some more light on that. What I would say is that, Trusted Call Solutions is a relatively new solution to the market. And I mean, Neustar over the past four or five years has taken it from zero to where it is today. And I think we\u2019ve guided on the specific dollars, but it\u2019s already been a considerable success. So don\u2019t think of this as us taking share from established players. This is an innovation that they brought to market that we\u2019re scaling. We\u2019re having success selling it across all of our vertical markets, frankly. And knock wood here, thus far, it\u2019s been the easiest cross sell that\u2019s come out of this TransUnion and Neustar combination. We view Trusted Call Solutions as \u2013 it\u2019s a product that straddles both marketing effectiveness, which is a major strategic push for us, but also risk mitigation. And again, it\u2019s based on the broad and unique phone intelligence that Neustar has always had at its core that goes all the way back to Argus info. And we think there\u2019s a lot of growth upside. So it has been, from a revenue perspective, a nice positive to our M&A case since we bought the business and we are focused on investing and accelerating and further scaling it.\nAndrew Jeffrey: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I was curious about the insurance business and the trends you saw in the quarter and how to think about the improvement for the rest of the year. Shopping is improving, marketing hasn\u2019t started to ramp just yet, kind of what are you hearing, what do you think happens with marketing as the year progresses? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. I think those are some fair insights, Heather. And what I\u2019ll say about insurance that we expect the growth rate in insurance to accelerate in the second half. We\u2019re happy that we\u2019ve already seen some improvement in the second quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that the third quarter of last year, and even the fourth quarter to a lesser extent for insurance we\u2019re quite muted, because marketing activity, client acquisition activity just came to a grinding halt because of the mismatch between the pricing and repair and replacement costs at P&C carriers. As we updated you last call, the carriers are making good progress in getting price increases from the various states. I think, and they say that there\u2019s still a bit more work to do, but we\u2019re approaching a point where they can initiate new business again with more confidence. And so with that, I\u2019d expect some improving trends on the marketing activities. Whether it goes back to the same level of frothiness or how long it takes to get to that point, it remains to be seen. But given the material price increases that they\u2019ve had to put through on their customers, there\u2019s an acceleration in shopping behavior, which has helped our numbers as well. So we\u2019ve got some pretty reasonable confidence that we\u2019re going to accelerate in insurance over the second half of the year. And hopefully, that\u2019ll set us up for a nice guide in 2024 too. \nAaron Hoffman: Great. Thanks, Chris. And given that we\u2019re now at the bottom of the hour, we want to be respectful of everyone\u2019s time on what we know is a busy day of earnings in the space. We\u2019re going to close down the call, but thank you everyone very much for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you over the course of the quarter. All the best.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on a reported and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions as we lap the purchase of Argus last quarter. Foreign exchange was a 1% headwind. Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA declined 3% on a reported basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margins sequentially improved to 35.0% down almost 200 basis points compared to the year ago second quarter, which had the most challenging comparison for 2023. Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 13% as a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense. Before I get into U.S. Markets results, a reminder that we are reporting Neustar revenue within our vertical market structure and we will discontinue providing standalone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023. Now looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. Markets revenue was up 1% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. Markets declined 5% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.6%. Financial services revenue was flat. Turning to the individual end markets. Consumer lending revenue declined low-double digits against a high-20% growth rate in the year ago quarter. After pulling back, late last year in response to a potentially weakening consumer, fintechs have stabilized and remain active market participants with reasonable access to funding. We also continued to see strength in the Buy Now Pay Later market. Our credit card business was down mid-single-digits against a high teens growth rate in the prior year quarter. Issuers remain selective on marketing outreach, but continue to originate at a healthy level. We are also benefiting from our relationships with larger firms that are aggressively utilizing digital marketing. Our auto business delivered low-single-digit growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, pricing, strong pre-qualification volumes, the impact of cross-selling, Neustar marketing and call center solutions. We are seeing improving supply of new vehicles somewhat offset by continued weakness in the used vehicle market. For mortgage, revenue was up 16% in the quarter, despite inquiry volumes falling about 29%. Absolute volumes remained weak, but year ago comparisons started to ease with volume declines offset by pricing and strong HELOC activity. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market is stagnated as home prices remain high and existing homeowners are reluctant to leave low rate mortgages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 6.5% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 25% and our revenue to increase roughly 20%. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 3% in the quarter. Insurance delivered another good quarter. Importantly, we are seeing carriers receive approval for rate increases and beginning to pass those increased prices to consumers, which we believe will continue to drive a recovery in shopping activity. At this point, insurers have largely limited their marketing activity to brand oriented campaigns and have yet to substantially reactivate personalized marketing to drive new applications. We also continue to benefit from new business wins, adoption of our innovations like TruVision driving history, growth in newer markets like life and commercial auto, and successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions. Tenant and employment screening was down against tough comps and a softening employment market. However, we continue to see signs of a recovery in the tenant market with month over month declines in rental rates, increases in move rates, and an increasing supply of rental units as new construction comes online. Our media vertical grew in the quarter as a result of continued business wins driven by the combination of TransUnion and Neustar Solutions as Chris described. Finally, we continue to see good growth in services and collections and tech, retail and e-commerce, particularly on the strength of customer wins of our Trusted Call Solutions suite. Consumer interactive revenue declined 2%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 47.0%, up about 80 basis points as a result of more focused advertising spending. Our direct business continues to decline as we recalibrate our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we've seen good returns on the revamp tactics with better than expected customer acquisition stats at attractive cost acquire. In our indirect business, we grew in the second quarter on the strength of new business wins, particularly with financial services accounts using TruEmpower, formerly known as our credit view platform, as well as a modest improvement with some of our partners that offer paid monitoring. For my comments about international, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 13% with four of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.3%, down about 100 basis points as a result of strategic investments across our regions. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, our largest international market, we grew 35% reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both consumer and commercial credit markets, as well as from fraud and direct-to-consumer offerings. We expect India to deliver another year of over 30% growth. And with the exception of COVID impact 2020, we have grown this business over 30% every year since 2017. In the UK, revenue declined 1%, excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts, including with the UK government, we would've grown about 3% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. While lending markets have softened, we continue to see large banks staying active to satisfy demand even as the fintech market has struggled. The same time, we have seen good performance for our affordability and trended credit solutions to help lenders assess portfolio risk. Our Canadian business grew 11% in the second quarter. While the market remains relatively flat, we have generated strong growth through the execution of share shifts in financial services and fintech as well as a recovery in property and casualty insurance underwriting activity. In Latin America, revenue was up 5% with broad-based growth across the majority of our markets, including another quarter of double-digit growth for our largest market Colombia. Brazil was down in the quarter as we've seen some weakness in the fintech market. While macro conditions have softened across Latin America, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintech's and neo banks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of TruVision trended credit, and our fraud solutions. In Asia Pacific, we grew 20% from continued good performance in Hong Kong and the Philippines, where we continue to add new offerings and win new business. Finally, Africa increased 10% on broadly strong performance across the portfolio and the region, despite a challenging macroeconomic and social environment in several of our largest markets. In South Africa, core banking business growth was driven by solid market conditions and new business wins. This growth was augmented by continued strength in fast growing verticals like telco and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in markets like Kenya, Zambia and Rwanda. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.5 billion of debt after pre-paying another $75 million in the quarter that left us with $442 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.8x. We have now prepaid $150 million of debt in 2023 and at this point we continue to intend to prepay additional debt in the second half of the year. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.4 billion of debt. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not in our plans this year. We are focused on integrating and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we expect FX to be in significant to revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $973 million and $988 million or up 4% to 5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 1.5 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be up 2.5% to 3.5% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $361 million and $370 million, an increase of 6% to 9%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be up 80 basis points to 110 basis points. We also expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.92 and $0.95, a range of down 1% to up 2%. Turning to the full year. Most of our guidance remains largely unchanged. We expect about 1 point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and we expect less than 1 point of impact from M&A. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis and up 2% to 4% excluding the impact of mortgage. For our business segments, our organic revenue growth outlook also remains unchanged. We expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single-digits, but low-single-digits without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up low-single-digits and down low-single-digits excluding mortgage. While the overall guidance for financial services is unchanged, we have modestly increased our expectations for consumer lending, but reduce them for mortgage. We expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single-digits. You can see the benefits of our diversified portfolio playing out, allowing us to maintain our full year revenue guidance. We anticipate that international will grow low-double-digits in constant currency turns driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets, and we continue to expect consumer interactive to decline low-single-digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion up 3% to 5%, also unchanged. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings partially offset by the inclusion of Argus' relatively lower margins in the first quarter and some revenue mix considerations. We anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share being flat to declining 4% with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth, and we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $275 million for the full year as the benefits of debt prepayment are offset by an increase in the SOFR forward curve. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Good morning, Jeff. This is Todd. I'll take that question and probably a very appropriate place for us to start this morning. So yes, in Q1 and Q2 we did beat expectations across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS and we did not raise the guide. And the reason for that is we feel that the economic conditions, particularly in the U.S. and in some of the developed markets that we operate in, continue to remain uncertain. And as a point to that and how we think about this, if you go back to our April call when we gave our Q1 results and the updated guide at that time we significantly increased our mortgage assumption for the year because we saw a mix shift more towards smaller players in the space. But we reduced our consumer lending forecast for the year close to similar amounts for all intents and purposes. And in the consumer lending space what we were seeing at that time was a slowdown and it was primarily in response to the aftermath of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature failures. We saw just a cautiousness in the late March, early April period. So what happened is in the second quarter those dynamics that I just articulated that we forecasted in essence we saw almost reverse, we saw interest rates tick up in particular on the 10 year yield, which had a direct impact on mortgage rates where we saw mortgage rates close to 7% not that long ago, still in the upper 6's. So as a result of that in this guide what we've done is we've taken down our mortgage assumption and conversely consumer lending as the second quarter went on and our customers got more and more comfortable with the type of environment that they were operating in, we started to see the consumer lending volumes tick up. So again, kind of a similar offsetting case there. So I think that's just important because when you look at the full year guide and you see that we maintain, there are puts and takes that we're seeing in the business and that's probably the best example I can give you. The thing I would say though is, needless to say is we're really pleased to have been able to outperform in the first half of the year. And really what we're focused on is de-risk and the \u2013 de-risking the second half of the year. But with that being said, when you look at the growth rates and the expectations for the second half of the year, we feel that the guide is strong. We feel like we're going to deliver a good second half. And it really gets to \u2013 point of your question is our customers, we are seeing a stability right now, again, in more of our developed markets. So think of U.S. financial services as well as in markets like Canada and even a little bit in the UK, maybe that's a little bit more pressured. And the international business continues to grow strongly in the double digits. So that's what gives us the conviction in the second half. And Chris, I would just add on to that, that just underscore the point that Neustar has performed to our expectations through the first half. And the second point that I think is important to understand is that this business is expected to be the fastest grower in our U.S. Markets business in 2023. So it gets to the question on the growth rates. Chris just said, we fully expect to deliver on the high-single digit. We put 3% growth up in Q1, 6% up in Q2. You can do the math as far as how high-single digits gets there. We have good visibility in the Q3, Q4, and it should be at a higher rate than what you've seen. Ashish, thanks for the question. So as far as our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is concerned, let's just say, I think the appropriate place to start is with our revenue guidance, right? And so if you look at the guide that we put out there obviously maintaining if you look at that from the high end of our guidance range, we are expecting incrementally more dollars to arrive from a revenue perspective in the second half. Seasonality is a big factor of that. So Q3 is typically one of TransUnion's highest revenue quarters on a historical basis in a normal non-pandemic times. So we \u2013 you can see that in the guide that there's incremental dollars that are assumed from a revenue perspective and that's going to drive a nice amount of flow through into our adjusted EBITDA margin. The second thing that I would say is that the Neustar cost synergies that Chris just alluded to in the previous question they continue to build for us and provide a very meaningful benefit. So that'll definitely be a driver for us as well. And coming of back to the first question that we got just about \u2013 in talking about the uncertainty that we face in the business, in response to that, the organization over the last year plus has prudently managed expenses. And we've been focused only on the most critical hires, we've pulled back on our travel and entertainment and looked for other one-time spend to be able to pull out of our operating expense run rate. So all of those forces are also in effect as well. And then the final point I would make is, if you think about Chris' opening remarks and where we covered the Global Capability Centers provides a very meaningful benefit to TransUnion. That's why we felt it was appropriate to provide that update and a little bit more detail this quarter. So that's definitely another driver for us as well too."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions and TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our strong second quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress with Neustar to accelerate revenue growth and achieve savings targets. And I'll wrap up with a short discussion of our global capability center strategy, which enables us to scale our global business efficiently and tap into diverse talent pools. And finally, Todd will detail our second quarter results, along with our third quarter and full year guidance. Through the second quarter, macroeconomic conditions are unchanged to slightly improve with reduced expectations for a recession in the U.S. In most of our markets globally, consumers continue to face higher interest rates and elevated although moderating inflation levels. This combination will continue to strain household finances, although high employment levels and modest real wage gains have mitigated the impact of these pressures to-date in most of our markets. Consumers remain resilient, and we see positive continued demand for borrowing. In the U.S., we've seen increased caution and tighter lending standards from banks. However, the strong demand for credit continues to be met by a broad range of lenders. U.S. consumers remain healthy and optimistic relative to historical norms with modest spending growth based on strong employment and real wage increases. Credit performance metrics have continued to normalize and remain within range of pre-pandemic and historical levels. Although delinquencies have increased, they're still very comfortable by historic standards across mortgage, card, auto and unsecured personal loans. Across our international portfolio, conditions also remain largely unchanged. In Canada and the UK, consumer health and credit demand continue to be similar to the U.S. with persistently high inflation and rising rates burdening consumers and slowing lending markets. However, lending volumes in our emerging markets of India, Asia-Pacific, South Africa and LatAm remain strong. Like many of our customers, we remain cautious about the rest of 2023. Therefore, we will again maintain our full year guidance at this point to account for market uncertainties despite overachieving in the second quarter. Todd will walk you through the details later of our third quarter and full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals. Now turning to second quarter highlights. We again beat our guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. U.S. markets grew 1% with financial services flat and emerging verticals up 3%. Our financial services vertical performed in line with our expectations, though mortgage was slightly below expectations but offset by modestly better performance in consumer lending. U.S. emerging verticals was also in line with our expectations and improved sequentially from the first quarter. Importantly, we have seen signs that the short-term headwinds we faced in tenant and employment screening and insurance are moderating, which should position us for faster growth in the second half of the year in those verticals. Our International segment grew constant currency revenue by double-digits for the ninth consecutive quarter, led by 35% revenue growth in India and double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, Africa and Canada. We continue to outperform our underlying markets because of market share gains and our industry-leading innovation. Across all our markets, our broad solutions portfolio is resonating with our customers, helping them navigate complex and hard to forecast economic conditions. And as I'll detail in a moment, we continue to make progress integrating Neustar and see strong customer adoption of our platforms and solutions. Also in the quarter, we announced a commercial partnership and a minority investment in Truework, a rapidly emerging player in the income and employment verification market. Truework uses sophisticated orchestration software to support a multipronged strategy to provide coverage of 90% of U.S. employees. We see an attractive opportunity to help bring Truework's unique solutions to our broad customer base in markets like financial services and rental screening, among others. And finally, we continue to direct our free cash flow towards reducing our debt levels. And in the second quarter, we've prepaid another $75 million in debt and intend to make additional prepayments in the second half of the year. We have now prepaid $150 million of debt this year. Moving to Neustar. Neustar delivered 6% organic growth as a result of solid performance across marketing, fraud and communications. For the full year, we continue to expect high single-digit revenue growth and a 32% margin, fueled by profit flow-through on accelerating revenues and attainment of our integration cost savings. We have line of sight to the revenue growth based on our strong bookings and the momentum achieved by joint sales teams aligned by vertical markets. In the first half of the year, we signed meaningful renewals with dozens of customers, including some of the largest companies in the world. We've also begun recognizing revenue on a number of new multimillion dollar contracts that we believe will accelerate growth in the second half. At the same time, we have numerous late-stage large contracts that should further enhance growth over the remainder of the year. Taken together, these wins give us confidence in delivering high-single digit growth for Neustar this year. During the quarter, we also announced a number of partnerships that further underpin our confidence in the short and long-term prospects for Neustar. At Snowflake's annual user conference, we announced the launch of TruAudience Marketing Solutions Transfer-less Identity Resolution app. It's now in the Snowflake marketplace. This partnership brings our advanced identity resolution capabilities to shared customers wherever their data and marketing technology lives. Together, we're helping our customers improve their consumer data quality and collaborate with partners without sharing sensitive customer information. Marketers and publishers want to connect disparate offline and online data and enrich consumer profiles with demographics data from TruAudience Identity Solutions. Using this app, they can do that without transferring data outside the Snowflake environment. The Transfer-less quality of the Native App helps to support security, privacy, and data governance. We also partnered with VideoAmp to release a comprehensive analytics solution for cross-platform media measurement and optimization. Marketers will now have more accurate visibility into the effectiveness of their linear television advertising by integrating VideoAmp's TV viewership dataset into the TruAudience marketing analytics and attribution solution. This integration enables marketers to better measure the holistic impact of their campaigns across TV and digital channels and to enable data-driven decisions. And we expanded our partnership with Magnite, the world's largest independent sell side advertising company, increasing their TruAudience data marketplace usage beyond connected TV. Magnite can now help agencies brand and publishers reach audiences across digital media channels, including streaming video, audio, gaming and digital out of home. TransUnion's TruAudience Data Marketplace offers advertisers and brands audience solutions that cover over 80 million U.S. connected homes. And our communication solutions continue to grow on the strength of our suite of TruContact Trusted Call Solutions or TCS, which grew about 75% in the second quarter. Our teams continue to identify new applications that have resulted in rapid customer adoption across a host of verticals. Let me detail some of the recent progress in two end markets. First, we've made inroads into the healthcare sector where TCS can enhance the effectiveness of necessary phone calls at many steps of care, including booking appointments, pre-appointment insurance authorizations, appointment reminders, telehealth phone calls, test results, prescription pickups, and payment notices or reminders. Second, we see opportunities in the public sector. A few weeks ago, we launched TruLookup Veteran Connect to help State Departments of Veterans Affairs improve outreach and effectively deliver housing, healthcare, job training, and other essential support to their members. In this case, TruContact Branded Call Display verifies that the inbound call is coming from the Department of Veterans Affairs and adds context to the mobile call display including brand name, location, logo, and reason for the call. Last quarter, I discussed our ongoing data and technology transformation, which has been supercharged by the Neustar acquisition. This quarter, I want to highlight our Global Capability Centers or GCCs and how they're enabling our transformation into a truly global organization. Investment in our GCCs in recent years has allowed us to centralize and standardize a variety of important work in high talent and lower cost locations. Today, our GCCs are delivering high quality solutions and services to customers using a follow the sun coverage approach across time zones. We launched our first GCC in 2018, and over the last five years, we've grown to more than 4,000 employees across India, South Africa in our newest location Costa Rica. Local GCC associates inject new ideas and energies into our solutions and our processes. Concentrating functions and software development, data science and analytics, operations and business support functions creates scale efficiencies and consolidates knowledge and best practices. And as we grow our market share in the region surrounding the GCCs, we believe their real-time support, regional expertise, and strong local language skills will be critical to supporting our customers. We've received numerous rewards reflecting the outstanding work of our GCCs. These include certification as great places to work in India and a top employer in South Africa. And in the last two months, our India GCC was recognized by NASSCOM, the Indian IT Business Process Management Association for its stellar distributed work model for the future, and also named by Everest Group as a top global business services employer in India. This recognition reflects the strong leadership we've put in place and the high caliber diverse talent they've assembled. We see the growth of our GCC network as another attractive path to margin expansion and improved operational performance in the year to come. Now that wraps up my comments on our market conditions, second quarter performance, progress, integrating Neustar and our successful GCC strategy. Now Todd will provide you with further details on our second quarter financial results and our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. Over to you, Todd. Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we had another good quarter beating our guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We're prudently holding our full year guidance given the level of uncertainty in the market, at the same time we continue to make meaningful progress integrating Neustar and delivering business wins from the combination. With that, I'll turn it back to Aaron. Okay, Kelsey, thank you for the question. And again, we're excited about our partnership with Truework's. I think any discussion of verified employment and income space starts with the context that the work number is setting the standard for product in this marketplace. But it's a big and attractive adjacent market for us. And I think the investment in Truework just reflects our continued efforts to find our way into this market and scale our revenues. We think the market is hungry for competitive alternatives and we're one of a number of players that seized the opportunity and we're going to continue to work to find the right solutions that can satisfy client needs and scale revenues. What we like about Truework is, they are rapidly emerging player in the space and they're very kind of foot forward technologically. They have sophisticated workflow and orchestration software that's very easy to access and has a very streamlined user interface that allows customers to fulfill the need through a variety of approaches or mechanisms that could be tapping into their database of employment and income, which is well beyond critical mass and growing from relationships with payroll processors, but also with major corporations. But they can also support a consumer permissioned account access workflow, the traditional telephonic workflow, document upload embedded within the loan origination lifecycle. So the kind of umbrella functionality that they provide across a range of fulfillment methods is particularly attractive. We think we have certainly attractive data assets and very broad distribution MSAs, relationships with the demand side that can help scale this investment. And then to some of your kind of more detailed questions, those are probably better for the Truework's CEO. But I think this just reinforces our strategic intent to compete in this space and our ongoing efforts to find the right solution to help us penetrate and scale. Okay. Yes, happy to focus on that. I'd say trading conditions for the fintechs are largely unchanged between the quarters. We see certainly reduced activity from prior years where their growth had really accelerated, but a lot of stability and resilience in the sector. They are still originating loans, albeit at a lower level, and they're more selective than they were previously. I don't think we've seen a distinct shift toward marketing and customer acquisition in either the fintechs or frankly, consumer lending in the broad, right. There is more caution and there's more sensitivity to risk, which has reduced overall marketing and acquisition activity. That said, there's still a good level of lending activity. There are certainly ample consumer appetite for loans because the consumer remains pretty healthy. And as long as that's the case, the market is going to find a way to fulfill that demand. And again, I think it's important again, to provide some context. While in 2022, in the first half of the year, the fintechs in consumer lending in general was booming. We saw that diminish in the second half of the year, and we still have kind of steady as she goes, outlook for fintechs for the remainder of this year. But with that said, the business is still up 75% over the last three years. And we view that as something to be excited about, not concerned about. Yes. Happy to elaborate on that. First of all, I would say, across the three product areas of marketing, risk and communications, we've had strong growth in each of those areas, and we are looking to accelerated growth in the third and the fourth quarter to reach the full year high single-digits guide. As I said in my commentary, we had strong renewals with big customers. We are ramping the revenues from big customer wins last year. We continue to sell well. And so there's a lot of positive indicators that give us confidence in that Neustar high single-digit guide. And yes, we absolutely are executing on our cross-sell and on our integrated product development in very meaningful ways. In prior calls, I've talked I think, extensively about the benefits of Neustar's technology. The OneID platform that they developed, which we have adopted and rebranded as OneTRU and is becoming the integrated data acquisition, management and analytics platform for TransUnion across multiple geographies and multiple markets. We'll continue to roll that out. We've firmly proven the concept that we can do it. So yes, the integration is going well on multiple levels. I think on the selling side, we integrated the sales forces in the first year, and they're very comfortable and their knowledge of the broader product line is increasing, and their comfort cross-selling is increasing, and we are seeing improvement. Now clearly under more work to do and a lot of upside there. So we're going to continue to push hard. But we do have integrated product development or multigenerational product plans in each of their product lines between the two companies. Yes, sure. Again, look, I have to acknowledge that Equifax has a very strong business in the space. We all understand that. However, I think their \u2013 I think the market will support multiple competitors in the space in different niches. And so when you take on a strong and entrenched competitor like this, you're looking for an opportunity to penetrate the market. The market, I think, is hungry for alternatives for a variety of competitive factors. I think it's healthy, for the market I think it's good for consumers. And I think Truework has demonstrated that they have a value proposition that can sell, that they are scaling the business and that the distribution partnership with us is going to be significantly additive to that. So we're working on growing this beachhead that they've established, and we can grow it in a variety of ways from adding records to increasing the distribution to deeper and more meaningful penetration into TransUnion products so they can ride our rails into our clients, et cetera. And we're just going to continue to fight the fight and there's really not a strategic change. Yes. Well, 6% growth in Neustar in the second quarter is right on plan. And the plan for Neustar over the course of 2023 was accelerating revenues based on the strength of the bookings and the implementations. The bookings from 2022, and the implementations ramping over the course of 2023. And that is playing out as planned. We still expect to get the high-single digits for Neustar in total by the end of the year. Now back to the guidance, the initial guide, yes, indeed, we did expect for the business to be executing in the low-double digit organic revenue range of a couple of years after acquisition. That is still our expectation for the potential of this business over the longer-term. But again, we are facing more challenging conditions overall economically, but certainly in terms of marketing and advertising spend than when we first provided that guidance. So right now, we're really focused on achieving high-single digit and sustaining that in the foreseeable future. Yes. Those are good adds and too early to guide for 2024. We're still focused on hitting 2023. The other add I guess is that the integration savings program continues right on target and as we grow revenue and we take costs out of the business, we're going to progress toward those long-term margin objectives for Neustar as well. Yes. And I think that's all spot on. And I think just to amplify that last point, centralizing operations and building out our global capability centers has been a big part of globalizing this company, but also making it structurally more profitable. And that's why we put a spotlight on the march that we've been on for the past five years now. And I \u2013 we think there's more opportunity. We're going to stay the course there and take full advantage of it. We also think there's opportunity and time to become structurally more efficient on the technology side, and as we continue our migration through Project Rise to the cloud with considerable standardization along the way that will then create an opportunity for us to consolidate the tech stack further and produce some further efficiencies there as well. So we're on a multi-year path here to get our margins back to where they were before the acquisitions, that's our commitment to investors. And it's a combination of the near-term things that Todd talked about, but also the strategic backdrop that we've been investing in for many years. Okay, well, let me shed some more light on that. What I would say is that, Trusted Call Solutions is a relatively new solution to the market. And I mean, Neustar over the past four or five years has taken it from zero to where it is today. And I think we've guided on the specific dollars, but it's already been a considerable success. So don't think of this as us taking share from established players. This is an innovation that they brought to market that we're scaling. We're having success selling it across all of our vertical markets, frankly. And knock wood here, thus far, it's been the easiest cross sell that's come out of this TransUnion and Neustar combination. We view Trusted Call Solutions as \u2013 it's a product that straddles both marketing effectiveness, which is a major strategic push for us, but also risk mitigation. And again, it's based on the broad and unique phone intelligence that Neustar has always had at its core that goes all the way back to Argus info. And we think there's a lot of growth upside. So it has been, from a revenue perspective, a nice positive to our M&A case since we bought the business and we are focused on investing and accelerating and further scaling it. Yes. I think those are some fair insights, Heather. And what I'll say about insurance that we expect the growth rate in insurance to accelerate in the second half. We're happy that we've already seen some improvement in the second quarter. I'll remind you that the third quarter of last year, and even the fourth quarter to a lesser extent for insurance we're quite muted, because marketing activity, client acquisition activity just came to a grinding halt because of the mismatch between the pricing and repair and replacement costs at P&C carriers. As we updated you last call, the carriers are making good progress in getting price increases from the various states. I think, and they say that there's still a bit more work to do, but we're approaching a point where they can initiate new business again with more confidence. And so with that, I'd expect some improving trends on the marketing activities. Whether it goes back to the same level of frothiness or how long it takes to get to that point, it remains to be seen. But given the material price increases that they've had to put through on their customers, there's an acceleration in shopping behavior, which has helped our numbers as well. So we've got some pretty reasonable confidence that we're going to accelerate in insurance over the second half of the year. And hopefully, that'll set us up for a nice guide in 2024 too."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the TransUnion 2023 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Aaron Hoffman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAaron Hoffman: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with the corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn the time over to Chris.\nChristopher Cartwright: Thanks, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our strong first quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress with Neustar to accelerate revenue growth, achieve targeted savings, and leverage its technologies across the enterprise.  Finally, Todd will detail our first quarter results, along with our second quarter and full year guidance. Inflation in our developed markets around the world remains elevated although its signs of subsiding as central banks have raised interest rates to slow consumer demand and return to long-term inflation targets. Higher prices and higher rates have pressured consumer finances and economic growth has slowed as a result. However, thus far, developing economies have been less impacted by these factors. Lending volumes in our emerging markets as India, Asia Pacific, South Africa and LATAM have remained strong. In the U.S., consumers remain healthy relative to historical norms with modest spending growth, high employment levels and some real wage increases.  Credit performance metrics have continued to normalize and remain within the range of pre-pandemic and historical levels. Against this backdrop, we\u2019ve seen increased caution from banks. While their financials are still strong and consumer demand for credit is healthy, banks are concerned that their markets might slow further and as a result have tightened lending standards, reduced marketing and originations and increased loss reserves.  Thus far, we've seen some limited impact on our business from these changing conditions. However, like our customers, we remain cautious about the rest of 2023. And I note that the recent failure of a few lenders should not cause the lending system to contract materially. We are confident that even if certain institutions slow their pace of origination, other lenders will take advantage of the situation to garner new business and satisfy strong consumer demand.  And given this confluence of concerns and despite our outperformance in the first quarter, we will maintain our full year guidance at this point to account for market uncertainties. Todd will walk you through the details later of our second quarter and full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals.  Now turning to first quarter highlights, we beat our guidance on a revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our financial services vertical performed slightly ahead of our expectations down 1% organically and flat excluding the impact of mortgage. Auto lending increased due to the easing of supply chain constraints and strong new business wins.  Card was flat despite comparing to continued very strong originations for over a year. Although consumer lending declined, it also face challenging comparisons over exceptional growth last year and mortgage was down mid-single-digits, but better than expected U.S. emerging verticals delivered moderate growth in line with our expectations, given the comparison to strong year ago performance.  Importantly, we've seen early signs of the temporary issues we faced in tenant and employment screening and insurance are abating setting us up for a good full year. Our International segment again grew constant currency revenue by double-digits for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by 32% growth in India and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America.  We continue to outperform our underlying markets as a result of strong lending growth, market share gains and our successful innovation. As I\u2019ll detail in a moment, we had another good quarter integrating Neustar and continue to see strong customer adoption of our platforms and solutions.  Finally, we continue to point our free cash flow toward reducing our debt levels and in the first quarter, we prepaid $75 million of debt with intent to make additional prepayments in the second quarter and the second half of the year.  Neustar delivered 3% of revenue growth largely in line with our expectations as we compared against last year's strongest growth quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit revenue growth at the 32% margin fueled by the revenue growth and achieving our aggressive integration cost savings. We have line of sight to the revenue growth based on our strong bookings and the momentum achieved by joint sales teams aligned by our market verticals.  We also enjoy a favorable portfolio effect from the broad range of Neustar Solutions. Our customers are challenged by compliance with privacy and regulatory requirements and also increasing focus on cost management and vendor consolidation, all of which play to our strengths as a scaled platform provider of identity-based solutions.  Our solutions are highly relevant regardless of the macro backdrop as we help customers unlock value in their first-party data, reach consumers reach consumers in a cost-effective manner, measure the return on their marketing investment, mitigate fraud and improve communication effectiveness.  We see this relevance playing out with meaningful new business wins across our verticals including a top 10 traditional lender, a large fintech player, a major auto manufacturer and a large used vehicle retailer.  Now this next slide illustrates the key Neustar integration and innovation initiatives. We made significant progress on each with meaningful path to deliver more value as we complete each initiative. As we execute our plan, we've identified substantial incremental opportunities for cost reduction and commercial success.  On previous calls, we've shared important progress on many of these initiatives. Infrastructure savings have been driven by data consolidation, rather data center consolidation in the migration of Neustar\u2019s cloud computing to the Google Cloud which supports improved performance at a lower cost. This enables a stronger cyber security stance, the opportunity to eliminate redundant tools and cost savings.  We've also made meaningful progress and are already seeing valuable lift and cost savings from combining TransUnion and Neustar data. Underlying the integration of Neustar is the combination of its data assets with TU\u2019s, bringing our data together on a common tech platform has given us 15% greater coverage of all adults in the U.S., a 10% increase in email coverage and a 15% improvement in telephone number coverage.  At the same time, by bringing more data sets in-house, we're realizing cost reductions and superior performance. Work is underway to bring together additional data sets, like offline household data, real-time digital interactions and phone signals, which should yield incremental uplift in performance when we complete this year.  Importantly, all of our US verticals and all product types benefit from these improvements. Greater value in our data assets is achieved by connecting them into a more complete and powerful identity graph where each company previously had its own identity graph per product, we now have one that performs considerably better. With this work well, underway, we're beginning to deploy this single identity graph across all products.  I'll offer you some compelling examples in a minute. At the same time, bringing all of our data together is just start. Underpinning all this progress is a single enterprise data and analytics platform, OneID. We benefit from improved data ingestion speeds in the ability to quickly link and match the data. We can also deliver superior analytics rapidly to our customers.  This is all done in a highly privacy compliant manner, to support both regulatory and customer-specific requirements. From there, we made progress in expanding and improving our customer data analytics enablement. We're migrating the Prama platform onto OneID where it will combine with Neustar\u2019s clean room functionality to create the next-generation of advanced analytic capabilities.  All this work has allowed us to consolidate products into integrated platforms like the TruAudience marketplace, enhanced call center capabilities and the combination of all of our best-in-class fraud solutions.  Let me spend some time on the significant progress we've made in aligning relevant TU and Neustar platforms. In the first quarter we announced a key milestone in the integration of Neustar with the launch of TruAudience marketplace. We married the expansive consumer data in identity resolution, audience building and targeting capabilities of TU and Neustar into a comprehensive and interoperable site of privacy-enhanced marketing solutions.  Additionally, the products now offers closed-loop marketing measurement and attribution and credit informed marketing solutions, which weren't previously available. TruAudience enables clients to improve marketing effectiveness by increasing audience reach, improving the quality of consumer insights and leveraging more accurate and up-to-date identity data across all marketing and measurement activities.  Clients have reported seeing a 40% reduction in duplicate CRM records and a 30% increase in conversions from higher performing audiences. TruAdience now leverages the proprietary data ecosystems of TU and Neustar spanning 200 authoritative data sources including data from over 16 billion monthly phone signals offline consumer data covering over 125 million US households and data spanning 10 billion real-time digital interactions daily.  Additionally, TruAudience combines TransUnion\u2019s direct media and technology partnerships across the television and streaming media world with Neustar\u2019s integrations across the Walled Garden and digital media ecosystem to ensure clients can reach and measure consumers across the channels that matter most. This includes partnerships with over 250 leading media owners and publishers networks and more than 100 advertising data management and cloud providers, as well social and retail media platforms, ad servers, demand-side and sell-side platforms, and customer data platforms.  In Communications, our Innovative family of trusted call solutions, which includes branded call display and caller name optimization continues to provide differentiated growth. While landline caller ID continues to decline, we are more than offsetting that headwind with considerable growth in TCS, which delivered a very strong first quarter and is expected to grow almost 50% in 2023.  In the first quarter, we onboarded one of the largest retailers in the US to our trusted call suite. A key part of the growth is the expansion of Branded Call display, which should triple in size this year and then represent about half of all TCS revenue. We're in the early days of penetrating the market with Branded Call, but we are scaling rapidly. We quadrupled the number of customers using this solution over the past year.  In addition to the impressive TCS growth, we continue to realize considerable cross-sell revenue from call center solutions, most notably with financial services and insurance customers. Further, we are creating a blended phone append that will lead to best-in-class right party contact solutions, leveraging our contact center and specialized risk data assets.  And in fraud, we continue to push toward the completion of a single, integrated platform that marries all of our best-in-class solutions including those acquired from Neustar. Early testing has shown substantial lift in match rates reduction in false positives and an increase in identification of fraudulent activity driven through the combination of TU and Neustar data.  We expect to have this fully formed offering in market by the end of this year. Just as we've integrated and redefined our solutions, we also announced an important rebranding of our global business solutions. We organize thousands of existing B2B products and dozens of brands into seven solution lines globally defined by business need and unified by a promise to deliver a true picture of consumers, a robust multi-layered and actionable view of each person stewarded with care.  You'll find explanations of each of the new brands on this slide. TU\u2019s rebranding clarifies our product offerings and better demonstrates our expertise in our heritage and new markets, while also making it easier for customers to find what they need. After almost 20 acquisitions in the last decade, this rebranding is a logical step in the company's evolution.  We can now offer more powerful consumer insights than ever before allowing us to meet the needs of our customers in more ways and at a much deeper level.  I want to conclude by noting that we recently published our annual sustainability and diversity reports, which can be found on our investor relations website. In both cases, you will find expanded disclosure and meaningful progress against important topics like diversity representation among our associates and more comprehensive ESG reporting.  I encourage all of our investors to read these important documents. As a reflection of our progress News Week recently named TransUnion one of the 500 most responsible companies.  That wraps up my comments on our market conditions, first quarter performance, progress in integrating Neustar, our global rebranding in our ongoing commitment to diversity in ESG.  Now, Todd will provide you with further details on our first quarter financial results, second quarter outlook and the full year 2023 outlook. Over to you Todd. \nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Argus added about two points to inorganic revenue, while foreign exchange was a two point headwind.  Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA declined 4% on a reported basis and was flat on an organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.3%, down 200 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter, as we had expected.  Excluding the impact of Argus, our organic constant currency, adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.4% or down about 90 basis points year-over-year. First quarter adjusted, diluted EPS declined 13% as a result of lower adjusted EBITDA, and higher interest expense.  Before I get into US markets\u2019 results, a reminder that we are now reporting Neustar within our vertical market structure to drive accountability and internal reporting clarity. And we will discontinue providing standalone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023.  Now looking at segment financial performance for the first quarter, US market\u2019s revenue was up 3% compared to the year-ago quarter. Organic revenue was flat in the quarter and was up 1%, excluding mortgage.  Adjusted EBITDA for US markets declined 8% on an as reported basis and declined 6% on an organic basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.2% for 33.9% on an organic basis. Financial Services, revenue grew 5% as reported and was down 1% organically, excluding Argus.  Excluding mortgage, organic revenue growth was flat despite comparing to a 21% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022 implying a 10% two year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end-markets, consumer lending revenue declined low-double-digits against a mid-30s growth rate in the year ago quarter.  As expected, lenders are pulling back and investors continue to be selective, but activity remains solid relative to historical levels, particularly in the BNPL space where we continue to see strong activity and new entrants. We are in an advantage position to focus on strategically extending and expanding existing relationships.  The breadth of offerings that we can provide allows us to further penetrate existing accounts with solutions like fraud mitigation, marketing, call center management and advanced analytic capabilities. Many of these capabilities are the results of recent acquisitions, especially Neustar.  Our credit card business was flat against mid-20s growth in the prior year quarter. Issuers continue to market with a focus on gaining top of wallet share with consumers, helping to drive origination activity. They are also benefiting from our relationships with larger firms that are aggressively utilizing digital marketing.  Our auto business delivers 8% growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, strong pre-qualification volumes, the impact of cross-selling Neustar marketing and call center solutions in addition to improving market conditions.  For mortgage, revenue was down only 6% in the quarter, despite origination volumes falling about 47%. The volume declines were offset by pricing, strong HELOC and marketing activity. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market has maintained decent origination levels and been helped by recent, so modest declines in mortgage rates.  On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 6% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 20% and our revenue to increase in the mid-20s. In addition to slightly improved volume expectations, we are seeing a higher share of volume from smaller, end-user customers, which are facing higher third-party pricing markups this year.  Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 1% in the quarter, despite a tough year ago, comparison. Insurance delivered another good quarter. Importantly, we are seeing carriers receive approval for rate increases and beginning to pass those increased prices to consumers, which is driving a recovery in shopping activity.  At this point, insurers have largely limited their marketing activity to brand-oriented campaigns and have yet to substantially reactivate personalized marketing to drive new applications. We remain confident that this recovery will come to fruition over the course of the year and improve the already attractive growth for our insurance vertical.  Tenant and employment screening growth again improved as a result of early signs of a recovery in the tenant market, with month-over-month declines in rental rates, increases and move rates, and an increasing supply of rental units as new construction comes online. This growth was somewhat offset by a softer employment screening market as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring.  Our Media vertical declined in the quarter, as a result of some market softness. Despite that, based on the new business wins we've achieved, we continue to expect the vertical to deliver growth for the full year. Consumer Interactive revenue declined 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 49.2%, up 310 basis points as a result of reduced advertising spending.  Our Direct business continues to decline as we recalibrate our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we're seeing good returns on the revamped tactics with better-than-expected, customer acquisition stats at attractive cost to acquire. In our Indirect business, we grew in the first quarter on the strength of new business wins and a modest improvement with some of our partners that offer paid monitoring.  Importantly, we continue to make progress fully integrating Sontiq into our global operating model, which we believe will facilitate increased cross-sell opportunities with existing customers and continue to provide us differentiated features in the market.  For my comments about International, all growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, up 80 basis points as a result of our strong revenue growth.  Now, let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue declined 8%. Excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts including with the UK government, we would have grown about 2% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. We continue to see strong demand for consumer loans and large banks staying active to satisfy this demand.  At the same time, we have seen good performance for our affordability in trended credit solutions, to help lenders assess portfolio risks. Our Canadian business grew 9% in the first quarter, driven by material business wins with a large bank, a major fintech lender and deepening credit use case in adjacent markets, which contributed to offset a generally softer demand for consumer credit.  In India, we grew 32%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both Consumer and Commercial Credit markets, as well as from fraud, employment screening and direct-to-consumer offerings.  In Latin America, revenue was up 11% with broad-based growth across our markets, including another quarter of double-digit growth for our largest market Columbia. While macro conditions have softened in the region, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintechs and neo banks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of credit vision and our fraud solutions.  In Asia Pacific, we grew 25% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by new business with fintech players and exceptional growth in the Philippines, which is now running well ahead of pre-COVID levels as the economy has now fully re-emerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory.  Finally, Africa increased 14% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio, and the region despite a challenging environment in several of our largest markets. In South Africa, core business growth was augmented by continued strength in fast-growing verticals like telco, and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in markets like Kenya and Zambia, particularly with micro and fintech lenders.  We ended the quarter with roughly $5.6 billion of debt after prepaying $75 million in the quarter. That left us with $439 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.8 times.  At this point, we intend to prepay additional debt in the second quarter and the full year. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.3 billion of debt. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not currently in our plans. We are focused on integrating, and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus.  That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, there is no impact from acquisitions. We expect revenue to come in between $948 million and $958 million or flat to up 1% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 2% on an organic constant currency basis.  Our revenue guidance includes an approximate one point tailwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% percent on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $330 million and $335 million, a decrease of 4% to 6%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 200 to 220 basis points as a result of the impact of revenue mix.  We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.81, and $0.83, a range of down 15% to 18%, a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense.  Turning to the full year, most of our guidance remains largely unchanged. We expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate less than 1% of benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as reported basis and in organic constant currency basis and up to 2% to 4% excluding the impact of mortgage.  For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect US markets to grow mid-single-digits, but low-single-digits without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate Financial Services to be up low-single-digits, and down low-single-digits excluding mortgage. While the overall guidance for Financial Services is unchanged, we have modestly reduced our expectations for Consumer Lending and Card to reflect an uncertain lending environment.  We expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single digits. We can see the benefits of our diversified portfolio playing out and allowing us to maintain our full year revenue guidance. We now anticipate that International will grow, low-double-digits in constant currency terms, up from high-single-digits and driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets and we continue to expect Consumer Interactive to decline, low-single-digits.  Turning back to total company outlook, we expect to adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion, up 3% to 5%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings, partially offset by the inclusion of Argus\u2019 relatively lower margin in the first quarter, and some revenue mix considerations.  We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS being flat to declining 4%, with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth. And we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control, and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million.  We anticipate net interest expense will be about $275 million for the full year, down slightly from our previous guidance due to our debt prepayment and a modest reduction in the forward LIBOR curve. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue.  I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. \nChristopher Cartwright : Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we had a good first quarter and we're holding our full year guidance out of an abundance of caution given the level of uncertainty in the market. At the same time, we continue to make meaningful progress integrating Neustar and delivering business wins from the combination.  Now, let me turn it over to Aaron. \nAaron Hoffman: Thanks, Chris. And that of course concludes our prepared remarks today. For the Q&A, as always, we ask that you each ask only one question. So that we can include more participants. Operator, we can begin the Q&A now. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  The first question today comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Steinerman: Could you speak about the three sub-segments of Neustar in terms of Neustar revenue growth both in the first quarter actual and in the 2023 goals of high-single-digits? And also, if there's anything else to talk about with Neustar in the first quarter in terms of the revenue growth deceleration besides for the year-over-year comparison, could just give us a little more color on that? \nChristopher Cartwright : Sure. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah, I guess, let me address the full year first. And I'll start by just reaffirming that we hit our plan for the first quarter for Neustar 3% above prior year comp in the quarter of 9% which is the high watermark for Neustar\u2019s growth in 20202. We feel like, we've got good confidence and good line of sight in the high-single-digit organic growth for the full year for Neustar in large part, because, it is largely 80% plus a subscription business retention rates that have been strong.  Plus we're layering in, we're ramping up on a very good year of sales and the good news is that, the bookings are continuing to be strong this year. So we're going to get some additional in year kind of revenue momentum. And then look, all three lines of business grew nicely in the first quarter and I expect them to grow well for the full year, marketing continues to do well, despite having a cyclical component, which is the audience generation piece of it.  But marketing continue to looks good. The Communication\u2019s data assets, all around trusted call or Branded Call display. As you can see from our commentary, they're doing really well. And I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future, and of course, fraud is doing well, as you would expect. So, I'd say, strength across the board and Todd's going to elaborate that. \nTodd Cello: Yes Andrew, just more specifically on the numbers themselves. As Chris already said, Neustar met our expectations in the first quarter, what I would say is across Communications, Marketing and Risk, we saw all three product lines grow in the quarter. But when we flip back to the to the full year, as we have said on the \u2013 in our prepared remarks, we are expecting high-single-digit growth and what we're seeing in Communications, Marketing and Resolutions is, that all three of those grow high single. For the full year it's our expectation. \nAndrew Simon: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Please go ahead. \nKelsey Zhu : Thanks for taking my question. So for Mortgage, there's quite a bit of outperformance compared to your peers, and you talked about pricing and strong performance in share and additional marketing products, can you just give us little bit more colors on what's going on there? \nChristopher Cartwright : Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, you're right to cite a number of variables that contribute to overall revenue growth in a vertical, right? So the Mortgage vertical for us, it could be pricing, it could be share, it could be volume and it could be just the broader basket of services that we're now marketing. But, the net-net while the magnitude of decline in the quarter was less than we expected most of the outperformance you're seeing is coming from the pricing impact that we're seeing roll through, a combination of third-party pricing and some pricing from TransUnion, as well.  And it\u2019s really the mix implication, right? The assumed mix versus the actual mix is a little bit different in the first quarter. It was more skewed towards smaller lenders, who typically pay higher unit prices that may be because the composition of mortgage volume, it was more toward purchases, which tend to be broadly distributed or representative across the market as opposed to refi, which gets more weighed at the higher end of the market.  But I would say, it's really a story of outperformance on the pricing dimension. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. \nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. So, I can certainly respect the prudence of not flowing Q1 upside into full year guidance raise in this macro. But as it relates to, I guess US financial markets and I think your language was an abundance of caution of what could come. Just, how much of this is about what's possible versus what you\u2019ve seen already.  So have you seen much client response yet in marketing spends origination criteria, I guess and/or bookings and pipeline progression or conversion? Thank you. \nChristopher Cartwright : Yeah, it's a good question. Todd and I\u2019ll weigh in on this together. But let me start. Yeah, look, it's one of those situations I guess, where, we\u2019ve outperformed if we were to, beat and raise the guidance for the year and then half the market would say, oh, well, that's risky. If we take a more prudent approach, like I think we have then some might argue it's too conservative.  But look, it's an uncertain market as we can all agree. And in terms of the impact, particularly from the banking stability that we had about a month ago, while we may have had some wobble in the daily volumes and in our conversations with clients we know that they're going to continue to be cautious about new originations and they are more cautious in terms of marketing and origination activity. There's still pretty good volume and pretty good demand.  Now, as we forecast it across the remainder of the year, in keeping with the methodology that we talked about in the last call, we didn't try and declare when a recession might happen or the depth of the duration of the recession. We just forecasted from the current subdued market characteristics and applied a bit of caution on top of that based on what we've seen in the first quarter.  But at this point, I can't say that the market has become materially more cautious in its marketing or origination posture than it already was.\nOperator: The next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nManav Patnaik : Thank you. Chris, I was hoping, maybe along the same lines, talk a little bit about your fintech customer base. There's a lot of chat, of course, given the specific banks that failed and whether that's, a great exposure for those customer base that you have and the unique insight into them. So, can you just share some, whether - whether they're struggling or some of them have to shut down? Or just, what's going on there and how that impacts your business with them? \nTodd Cello: Hey, good morning. Manav, this is Todd. I'm going to take that question. So, first of all is, as it pertains to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures, I would say that TransUnion had virtually no revenue exposure to either bank. I think what's important to remember as well too is that, TransUnion\u2019s customer base in our core Financial Services.  And this is excluding Neustar and Argus, about a third of our revenues come from our top 20 customers, another third come from our 21st to 100 customers. And then another third of those come from thousands of other customers. So the point there is, we have a very nice diversified base of customers. We\u2019re not necessarily upheld in a kind of situation with one particular customer.  As it pertains to the, failures of themselves, I would say that TransUnion saw no direct impact of it. However, we did see an indirect effect and that's just the tightening, the tighter of lending that what Chris has already articulated and we talked about it in our prepared remarks this morning. In particular, just again as a reminder, just to caution that we're taking with Card, Consumer Lending and which we've reflected in our updated guidance.  When we look specifically, at our Consumer Lending LLB with in Financial Services, Consumer Lending, it\u2019s where our fintechs residers is probably most held. And I think what's important to remember here is that the growth rectory of the - of this Consumer Lending business has been particularly strong in 2021. We saw really strong growth in \u201822 that growth continued in the mid-teens.  And, right now, we're calling for a high-single-digit decline with that customer base. So what does all that mean? What it means is, on a compounded annual growth rate basis, we're talking about a mid-teen performance for this customer base for the last three years, which is pretty exceptional. And I think what's important also to remember with the fintechs is that this isn't a linear business.  But what they will do is, they will outperform overall lending market over time. A couple other things I think are important to call out with this customer base is, there still demand, both on the customer side as well as on the consumer side and capital is available. Just what we're living through right now is that, our customers are just being more selective as well as their investors are.  And what's encouraging to us is, we've embraced the fintechs since the very beginning and the customers here in this space have gotten more sophisticated and they want to buy our broad based solution suite, which we've only done nothing, but enhance due to our recent acquisitions of Neustar and Argus. And the last point here is, the BNPL part of this area is still growing nicely. \nOperator: The next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nFaiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Good morning. Todd, I wanted to ask about the margins in the back half of the year. Your 2Q guide is indicating that we're going to see huge margin expansion and the back half. And I think you've talked about Neustar and others synergies coming through in the back half and maybe give us a bit more color around what are some of the puts and takes to think about? \nTodd Cello: I'd be happy to, Faiza. Thank you for the question. So, just kind of grown is in the numbers, our margin in the first quarter was 34.3% and the guidance that we just provided for Q2 is contemplating 34.8% to 35% on the margin. And in the full year it\u2019s 36.3% to 36.6%. So, if you take the, kind of the high, of that and figure out what the second half would be for roughly estimating, we need about a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin in the second half.  So it's about 300 basis points higher than the high end of our 2Q guide. Okay, so how are we going to do that? Well, first is just our revenue expectations I think I can\u2019t stop without saying. But the second part of that is the synergies pertaining to Neustar only. We spoke about that during our February call. We - of the number, we initially said that the overall synergies and when we announced the acquisition back September 2021 that\u2019s going to be $70 million. Back in February, we increased the number to $80 million just based on what we have accomplished in the pretty good line of sight that we have in achieving that.  In addition, to the revenue and the synergies, we're also being very proactive on the cost management side, as we're navigating a very uncertain market. So first we are focused only on making critical hires in areas of strategic importance to us. We've tightened our travel and entertainment and we've eliminated significant one-time spend in our specific consulting engagements. In addition to all of that what also gives us the conviction in the margin that we're also seeing the early benefits of our global approach towards operating TransUnion through our global capability centers, as well as the early benefits that we're continuing to enjoy for our technology transformation which we refer to as Project Rise. \nOperator: The next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I was just hoping you could put a finer point on the trajectory of the market trends. What are you seeing in terms of consumer demand and lender tightening credit so far in April versus January or February? And also just to get a directional sense April versus second half of March? Thanks. \nChristopher Cartwright : Well, Toni, we\u2019ll try and offer you a little bit of color on that. I mean, going back to the period of bank instability that we experienced about a month back, I think, while certainly the bank failure \u2013 the failures we experienced and then some of the incremental pressure, it's unfortunate. That was really - it was really more fear-driven I think and amplified across our many media touchpoints.  From what I've read, since then, and from what we've seen, while there could be some implications on liquidity and just available capital to loan from the conventional banking segment, that's likely to be just kind of small. And I think as I mentioned earlier, in and around the crisis, we saw some wobble in daily volume figures.  But I wouldn't say it was material and or that it's been particularly material since. But I think it's also important understand that demand for credit for consumers remains strong and to the degree that it can't be satisfied from conventional bank lenders, alternative funding sources are going to come into the market. They may replenish available funding in the fintech space.  We have seen this. We've experienced it several times, particularly with the fintech lenders where whatever there's market uncertainty, fintech pulls back very quickly. It takes a period of time from the, - from the supply side to decide which lenders they want to back and what degree and what price, right? But I would expect that to be a kind of quarterly disruption in supply meeting demand and that that's going to correct itself.  And you're going to continue to see at consistent level of lending activity over the course of this year, despite the turmoil on the Bank segment and just the general uncertainty in the environment. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Well, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the emerging vertical and the acceleration that we are expecting. I was wondering if you could provide some color on the cadence and in terms of driver is it right for us to think about a lot of the growth is really coming from Neustar accelerating through the rest of the year. But also some other puts and takes around employment screening, tenant, screening and insurance will be helpful? Thanks. \nChristopher Cartwright : Yeah, well, thanks for that question. So, emerging did grow in the first quarter about a point and a half. The starting point in the story for the year though, is to point out that it was growing over almost 10% organic comps in the same quarter prior year. And that was again the high watermark. The expectation is over the course of the year, one comps are going to ease as we've said and that kind of underpins our forecast, its entirety, to also turn the emerging segment.  So easier comps and accelerating growth in a few areas where for idiosyncratic reasons and some market reasons, I think growth fell below where we would typically expect it. That's certainly true in tenant, screening. We talked a lot about the dynamics there of reduced move volumes because of high prices. That has eased quite a bit in the recent quarter or so.  And then there's also an expectation of a million additional housing units, rental housing users to come on the market and that should get us back more toward normal volumes, normal revenues. We're also seeing a recovery in our insurance business. It's probably the largest single segment it is within the emerging verticals and it was subdued because insurers needed higher prices to compensate for increased repair and replacement costs.  That's largely work itself through the system. We are seeing volumes there improve, as well. Retail and e-commerce are showing some nice strength. A lot of that has to do with the sales of Trusted Call solutions and Branded Call display. And in public sector, there were just some - public sector is kind of a big deal-driven and so it can be lumpy.  And of course, we had to comp some \u2013 a contract where there was diminished volume for, some, again maybe idiosyncratic reasons, but we expect public sector to come back, as well. So, we've got pretty good confidence in the forecast of revenue acceleration over the remainder the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nHeather Balsky: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping to touch on Consumer Interactive. And it sounds like you're pulling back on some of your products and just cleaning up the mix there. Can you talk about what's happening in that segment? \nChristopher Cartwright : Yeah. Well, I would say that Consumer Interactive, as you know it's been challenged for about the past 18 to 24 months. The market dynamics are such where the productivity of our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts declined. We think some of that has to do with structural shift toward freemium. Some of it may have to do with just the economic environment and consumers pairing subscriptions.  But that was - it remains the drag in our overall, direct-to-consumer business. Last year, we were in the indirect side of the business, lapping some contract restructuring. That's fully in the rearview mirror now and the indirect piece, which is materially larger is kind of return to the expected growth levels, which is great. Sontiq has given us new and exciting capabilities that continues to grow kind of low-double-digits.  We're feeling good about that. And in total, over the course of this year, you're going to see the rate of organic decline lessen. That's mainly going to be because Sontiq and Indirect are going to perform well in line with expectations. And the Indirect piece is going to become less and less negative as we get to kind of a equilibrium with our new level of marketing spend. \nOperator: The next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning. Just wondering if your guidance, your full year outlook kind of contemplates any changes in the student loan forgiveness landscape. There's some discussion that that could really cause some pickup in delinquencies, just how you're thinking about that? Thanks. \nChristopher Cartwright : Well, what I would say generally is, the former lenders who run our financial services business do a granular build up of trajectory and pipeline from every type of lender. And they would have included any potential impact from the student lending space. At this point, that doesn't figure prominently on my risk radar. So I feel like, we're in pretty good shape with the guidance that we've reiterated today. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Given the increased traction and headlines around Artificial Intelligence and maybe Generative AI, more specifically, I was hoping you could spend some time talking about how you're leveraging AI at Trans Union today? And maybe what some incremental opportunities might be to leverage it further going forward? And maybe how that could impact growth, your margins in the medium term? Thank you. \nChristopher Cartwright : Great question, Andrew. Actually, Todd and I are on vacation today and you're interfacing with an internal AI bot. Kidding, aside, from course. Look, we have been in the credit reporting agency and business in TransUnion in particular, we've been using machine learning and some AI capabilities for some time.  And we're excited about the potential for improving the efficiency that this technology step forward represents. I think there are various internal processes, a dispute resolution comes to mind where we could see some really material impacts over time as we apply this to service consumers more effectively. In terms of actual credit modeling and alike, it no doubt has a role, but I think we have to remember that our data and the needs that we serve are highly regulated and in privacy, in information security, really comes out a premium.  So we're not going to, for example, send credit information over to the public web to interface with Chat GPT, or anything like that. We will continue to invest in kind of AI large language models that are tuned to credit needs that meet privacy and security requirements. And that's something that's going to evolve over time. But, we will be investing in this area as appropriate and I think it's going to be an enhancement generally to our ability to provide services \nAaron Hoffman: Great. And now we're going to wrap up the call here at the bottom of the hour. I know is a very busy earnings day and asking this in spite of the quarter. So we want to be respectful of everybody's time on the call and we'll draw it to a close there. Thanks everyone for your time today. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. All the best.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christopher Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll discuss the macroeconomic conditions in TransUnion's markets around the world. Then I'll provide an overview of our strong first quarter financial performance. I'll also review the continued progress with Neustar to accelerate revenue growth, achieve targeted savings, and leverage its technologies across the enterprise.  Finally, Todd will detail our first quarter results, along with our second quarter and full year guidance. Inflation in our developed markets around the world remains elevated although its signs of subsiding as central banks have raised interest rates to slow consumer demand and return to long-term inflation targets. Higher prices and higher rates have pressured consumer finances and economic growth has slowed as a result. However, thus far, developing economies have been less impacted by these factors. Lending volumes in our emerging markets as India, Asia Pacific, South Africa and LATAM have remained strong. In the U.S., consumers remain healthy relative to historical norms with modest spending growth, high employment levels and some real wage increases.  Credit performance metrics have continued to normalize and remain within the range of pre-pandemic and historical levels. Against this backdrop, we've seen increased caution from banks. While their financials are still strong and consumer demand for credit is healthy, banks are concerned that their markets might slow further and as a result have tightened lending standards, reduced marketing and originations and increased loss reserves.  Thus far, we've seen some limited impact on our business from these changing conditions. However, like our customers, we remain cautious about the rest of 2023. And I note that the recent failure of a few lenders should not cause the lending system to contract materially. We are confident that even if certain institutions slow their pace of origination, other lenders will take advantage of the situation to garner new business and satisfy strong consumer demand.  And given this confluence of concerns and despite our outperformance in the first quarter, we will maintain our full year guidance at this point to account for market uncertainties. Todd will walk you through the details later of our second quarter and full year guidance and expectations for each of our markets and verticals.  Now turning to first quarter highlights, we beat our guidance on a revenue adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our financial services vertical performed slightly ahead of our expectations down 1% organically and flat excluding the impact of mortgage. Auto lending increased due to the easing of supply chain constraints and strong new business wins.  Card was flat despite comparing to continued very strong originations for over a year. Although consumer lending declined, it also face challenging comparisons over exceptional growth last year and mortgage was down mid-single-digits, but better than expected U.S. emerging verticals delivered moderate growth in line with our expectations, given the comparison to strong year ago performance.  Importantly, we've seen early signs of the temporary issues we faced in tenant and employment screening and insurance are abating setting us up for a good full year. Our International segment again grew constant currency revenue by double-digits for the eighth consecutive quarter, led by 32% growth in India and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America.  We continue to outperform our underlying markets as a result of strong lending growth, market share gains and our successful innovation. As I'll detail in a moment, we had another good quarter integrating Neustar and continue to see strong customer adoption of our platforms and solutions.  Finally, we continue to point our free cash flow toward reducing our debt levels and in the first quarter, we prepaid $75 million of debt with intent to make additional prepayments in the second quarter and the second half of the year.  Neustar delivered 3% of revenue growth largely in line with our expectations as we compared against last year's strongest growth quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect high-single-digit revenue growth at the 32% margin fueled by the revenue growth and achieving our aggressive integration cost savings. We have line of sight to the revenue growth based on our strong bookings and the momentum achieved by joint sales teams aligned by our market verticals.  We also enjoy a favorable portfolio effect from the broad range of Neustar Solutions. Our customers are challenged by compliance with privacy and regulatory requirements and also increasing focus on cost management and vendor consolidation, all of which play to our strengths as a scaled platform provider of identity-based solutions.  Our solutions are highly relevant regardless of the macro backdrop as we help customers unlock value in their first-party data, reach consumers reach consumers in a cost-effective manner, measure the return on their marketing investment, mitigate fraud and improve communication effectiveness.  We see this relevance playing out with meaningful new business wins across our verticals including a top 10 traditional lender, a large fintech player, a major auto manufacturer and a large used vehicle retailer.  Now this next slide illustrates the key Neustar integration and innovation initiatives. We made significant progress on each with meaningful path to deliver more value as we complete each initiative. As we execute our plan, we've identified substantial incremental opportunities for cost reduction and commercial success.  On previous calls, we've shared important progress on many of these initiatives. Infrastructure savings have been driven by data consolidation, rather data center consolidation in the migration of Neustar's cloud computing to the Google Cloud which supports improved performance at a lower cost. This enables a stronger cyber security stance, the opportunity to eliminate redundant tools and cost savings.  We've also made meaningful progress and are already seeing valuable lift and cost savings from combining TransUnion and Neustar data. Underlying the integration of Neustar is the combination of its data assets with TU's, bringing our data together on a common tech platform has given us 15% greater coverage of all adults in the U.S., a 10% increase in email coverage and a 15% improvement in telephone number coverage.  At the same time, by bringing more data sets in-house, we're realizing cost reductions and superior performance. Work is underway to bring together additional data sets, like offline household data, real-time digital interactions and phone signals, which should yield incremental uplift in performance when we complete this year.  Importantly, all of our US verticals and all product types benefit from these improvements. Greater value in our data assets is achieved by connecting them into a more complete and powerful identity graph where each company previously had its own identity graph per product, we now have one that performs considerably better. With this work well, underway, we're beginning to deploy this single identity graph across all products.  I'll offer you some compelling examples in a minute. At the same time, bringing all of our data together is just start. Underpinning all this progress is a single enterprise data and analytics platform, OneID. We benefit from improved data ingestion speeds in the ability to quickly link and match the data. We can also deliver superior analytics rapidly to our customers.  This is all done in a highly privacy compliant manner, to support both regulatory and customer-specific requirements. From there, we made progress in expanding and improving our customer data analytics enablement. We're migrating the Prama platform onto OneID where it will combine with Neustar's clean room functionality to create the next-generation of advanced analytic capabilities.  All this work has allowed us to consolidate products into integrated platforms like the TruAudience marketplace, enhanced call center capabilities and the combination of all of our best-in-class fraud solutions.  Let me spend some time on the significant progress we've made in aligning relevant TU and Neustar platforms. In the first quarter we announced a key milestone in the integration of Neustar with the launch of TruAudience marketplace. We married the expansive consumer data in identity resolution, audience building and targeting capabilities of TU and Neustar into a comprehensive and interoperable site of privacy-enhanced marketing solutions.  Additionally, the products now offers closed-loop marketing measurement and attribution and credit informed marketing solutions, which weren't previously available. TruAudience enables clients to improve marketing effectiveness by increasing audience reach, improving the quality of consumer insights and leveraging more accurate and up-to-date identity data across all marketing and measurement activities.  Clients have reported seeing a 40% reduction in duplicate CRM records and a 30% increase in conversions from higher performing audiences. TruAdience now leverages the proprietary data ecosystems of TU and Neustar spanning 200 authoritative data sources including data from over 16 billion monthly phone signals offline consumer data covering over 125 million US households and data spanning 10 billion real-time digital interactions daily.  Additionally, TruAudience combines TransUnion's direct media and technology partnerships across the television and streaming media world with Neustar's integrations across the Walled Garden and digital media ecosystem to ensure clients can reach and measure consumers across the channels that matter most. This includes partnerships with over 250 leading media owners and publishers networks and more than 100 advertising data management and cloud providers, as well social and retail media platforms, ad servers, demand-side and sell-side platforms, and customer data platforms.  In Communications, our Innovative family of trusted call solutions, which includes branded call display and caller name optimization continues to provide differentiated growth. While landline caller ID continues to decline, we are more than offsetting that headwind with considerable growth in TCS, which delivered a very strong first quarter and is expected to grow almost 50% in 2023.  In the first quarter, we onboarded one of the largest retailers in the US to our trusted call suite. A key part of the growth is the expansion of Branded Call display, which should triple in size this year and then represent about half of all TCS revenue. We're in the early days of penetrating the market with Branded Call, but we are scaling rapidly. We quadrupled the number of customers using this solution over the past year.  In addition to the impressive TCS growth, we continue to realize considerable cross-sell revenue from call center solutions, most notably with financial services and insurance customers. Further, we are creating a blended phone append that will lead to best-in-class right party contact solutions, leveraging our contact center and specialized risk data assets.  And in fraud, we continue to push toward the completion of a single, integrated platform that marries all of our best-in-class solutions including those acquired from Neustar. Early testing has shown substantial lift in match rates reduction in false positives and an increase in identification of fraudulent activity driven through the combination of TU and Neustar data.  We expect to have this fully formed offering in market by the end of this year. Just as we've integrated and redefined our solutions, we also announced an important rebranding of our global business solutions. We organize thousands of existing B2B products and dozens of brands into seven solution lines globally defined by business need and unified by a promise to deliver a true picture of consumers, a robust multi-layered and actionable view of each person stewarded with care.  You'll find explanations of each of the new brands on this slide. TU's rebranding clarifies our product offerings and better demonstrates our expertise in our heritage and new markets, while also making it easier for customers to find what they need. After almost 20 acquisitions in the last decade, this rebranding is a logical step in the company's evolution.  We can now offer more powerful consumer insights than ever before allowing us to meet the needs of our customers in more ways and at a much deeper level.  I want to conclude by noting that we recently published our annual sustainability and diversity reports, which can be found on our investor relations website. In both cases, you will find expanded disclosure and meaningful progress against important topics like diversity representation among our associates and more comprehensive ESG reporting.  I encourage all of our investors to read these important documents. As a reflection of our progress News Week recently named TransUnion one of the 500 most responsible companies.  That wraps up my comments on our market conditions, first quarter performance, progress in integrating Neustar, our global rebranding in our ongoing commitment to diversity in ESG.  Now, Todd will provide you with further details on our first quarter financial results, second quarter outlook and the full year 2023 outlook. Over to you Todd. Thank you, Todd. To wrap up, we had a good first quarter and we're holding our full year guidance out of an abundance of caution given the level of uncertainty in the market. At the same time, we continue to make meaningful progress integrating Neustar and delivering business wins from the combination.  Now, let me turn it over to Aaron. Sure. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah, I guess, let me address the full year first. And I'll start by just reaffirming that we hit our plan for the first quarter for Neustar 3% above prior year comp in the quarter of 9% which is the high watermark for Neustar's growth in 20202. We feel like, we've got good confidence and good line of sight in the high-single-digit organic growth for the full year for Neustar in large part, because, it is largely 80% plus a subscription business retention rates that have been strong.  Plus we're layering in, we're ramping up on a very good year of sales and the good news is that, the bookings are continuing to be strong this year. So we're going to get some additional in year kind of revenue momentum. And then look, all three lines of business grew nicely in the first quarter and I expect them to grow well for the full year, marketing continues to do well, despite having a cyclical component, which is the audience generation piece of it.  But marketing continue to looks good. The Communication's data assets, all around trusted call or Branded Call display. As you can see from our commentary, they're doing really well. And I expect that to continue for the foreseeable future, and of course, fraud is doing well, as you would expect. So, I'd say, strength across the board and Todd's going to elaborate that. Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, you're right to cite a number of variables that contribute to overall revenue growth in a vertical, right? So the Mortgage vertical for us, it could be pricing, it could be share, it could be volume and it could be just the broader basket of services that we're now marketing. But, the net-net while the magnitude of decline in the quarter was less than we expected most of the outperformance you're seeing is coming from the pricing impact that we're seeing roll through, a combination of third-party pricing and some pricing from TransUnion, as well.  And it's really the mix implication, right? The assumed mix versus the actual mix is a little bit different in the first quarter. It was more skewed towards smaller lenders, who typically pay higher unit prices that may be because the composition of mortgage volume, it was more toward purchases, which tend to be broadly distributed or representative across the market as opposed to refi, which gets more weighed at the higher end of the market.  But I would say, it's really a story of outperformance on the pricing dimension. Yeah, it's a good question. Todd and I'll weigh in on this together. But let me start. Yeah, look, it's one of those situations I guess, where, we've outperformed if we were to, beat and raise the guidance for the year and then half the market would say, oh, well, that's risky. If we take a more prudent approach, like I think we have then some might argue it's too conservative.  But look, it's an uncertain market as we can all agree. And in terms of the impact, particularly from the banking stability that we had about a month ago, while we may have had some wobble in the daily volumes and in our conversations with clients we know that they're going to continue to be cautious about new originations and they are more cautious in terms of marketing and origination activity. There's still pretty good volume and pretty good demand.  Now, as we forecast it across the remainder of the year, in keeping with the methodology that we talked about in the last call, we didn't try and declare when a recession might happen or the depth of the duration of the recession. We just forecasted from the current subdued market characteristics and applied a bit of caution on top of that based on what we've seen in the first quarter.  But at this point, I can't say that the market has become materially more cautious in its marketing or origination posture than it already was. Well, Toni, we'll try and offer you a little bit of color on that. I mean, going back to the period of bank instability that we experienced about a month back, I think, while certainly the bank failure \u2013 the failures we experienced and then some of the incremental pressure, it's unfortunate. That was really - it was really more fear-driven I think and amplified across our many media touchpoints.  From what I've read, since then, and from what we've seen, while there could be some implications on liquidity and just available capital to loan from the conventional banking segment, that's likely to be just kind of small. And I think as I mentioned earlier, in and around the crisis, we saw some wobble in daily volume figures.  But I wouldn't say it was material and or that it's been particularly material since. But I think it's also important understand that demand for credit for consumers remains strong and to the degree that it can't be satisfied from conventional bank lenders, alternative funding sources are going to come into the market. They may replenish available funding in the fintech space.  We have seen this. We've experienced it several times, particularly with the fintech lenders where whatever there's market uncertainty, fintech pulls back very quickly. It takes a period of time from the, - from the supply side to decide which lenders they want to back and what degree and what price, right? But I would expect that to be a kind of quarterly disruption in supply meeting demand and that that's going to correct itself.  And you're going to continue to see at consistent level of lending activity over the course of this year, despite the turmoil on the Bank segment and just the general uncertainty in the environment. Yeah, well, thanks for that question. So, emerging did grow in the first quarter about a point and a half. The starting point in the story for the year though, is to point out that it was growing over almost 10% organic comps in the same quarter prior year. And that was again the high watermark. The expectation is over the course of the year, one comps are going to ease as we've said and that kind of underpins our forecast, its entirety, to also turn the emerging segment.  So easier comps and accelerating growth in a few areas where for idiosyncratic reasons and some market reasons, I think growth fell below where we would typically expect it. That's certainly true in tenant, screening. We talked a lot about the dynamics there of reduced move volumes because of high prices. That has eased quite a bit in the recent quarter or so.  And then there's also an expectation of a million additional housing units, rental housing users to come on the market and that should get us back more toward normal volumes, normal revenues. We're also seeing a recovery in our insurance business. It's probably the largest single segment it is within the emerging verticals and it was subdued because insurers needed higher prices to compensate for increased repair and replacement costs.  That's largely work itself through the system. We are seeing volumes there improve, as well. Retail and e-commerce are showing some nice strength. A lot of that has to do with the sales of Trusted Call solutions and Branded Call display. And in public sector, there were just some - public sector is kind of a big deal-driven and so it can be lumpy.  And of course, we had to comp some \u2013 a contract where there was diminished volume for, some, again maybe idiosyncratic reasons, but we expect public sector to come back, as well. So, we've got pretty good confidence in the forecast of revenue acceleration over the remainder the year. Yeah. Well, I would say that Consumer Interactive, as you know it's been challenged for about the past 18 to 24 months. The market dynamics are such where the productivity of our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts declined. We think some of that has to do with structural shift toward freemium. Some of it may have to do with just the economic environment and consumers pairing subscriptions.  But that was - it remains the drag in our overall, direct-to-consumer business. Last year, we were in the indirect side of the business, lapping some contract restructuring. That's fully in the rearview mirror now and the indirect piece, which is materially larger is kind of return to the expected growth levels, which is great. Sontiq has given us new and exciting capabilities that continues to grow kind of low-double-digits.  We're feeling good about that. And in total, over the course of this year, you're going to see the rate of organic decline lessen. That's mainly going to be because Sontiq and Indirect are going to perform well in line with expectations. And the Indirect piece is going to become less and less negative as we get to kind of a equilibrium with our new level of marketing spend. Well, what I would say generally is, the former lenders who run our financial services business do a granular build up of trajectory and pipeline from every type of lender. And they would have included any potential impact from the student lending space. At this point, that doesn't figure prominently on my risk radar. So I feel like, we're in pretty good shape with the guidance that we've reiterated today. Great question, Andrew. Actually, Todd and I are on vacation today and you're interfacing with an internal AI bot. Kidding, aside, from course. Look, we have been in the credit reporting agency and business in TransUnion in particular, we've been using machine learning and some AI capabilities for some time.  And we're excited about the potential for improving the efficiency that this technology step forward represents. I think there are various internal processes, a dispute resolution comes to mind where we could see some really material impacts over time as we apply this to service consumers more effectively. In terms of actual credit modeling and alike, it no doubt has a role, but I think we have to remember that our data and the needs that we serve are highly regulated and in privacy, in information security, really comes out a premium.  So we're not going to, for example, send credit information over to the public web to interface with Chat GPT, or anything like that. We will continue to invest in kind of AI large language models that are tuned to credit needs that meet privacy and security requirements. And that's something that's going to evolve over time. But, we will be investing in this area as appropriate and I think it's going to be an enhancement generally to our ability to provide services"

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. I'll start off with our consolidated financial results. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 2% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Argus added about two points to inorganic revenue, while foreign exchange was a two point headwind.  Our business grew 2% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2022 and 2023. Adjusted EBITDA declined 4% on a reported basis and was flat on an organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.3%, down 200 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter, as we had expected.  Excluding the impact of Argus, our organic constant currency, adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.4% or down about 90 basis points year-over-year. First quarter adjusted, diluted EPS declined 13% as a result of lower adjusted EBITDA, and higher interest expense.  Before I get into US markets' results, a reminder that we are now reporting Neustar within our vertical market structure to drive accountability and internal reporting clarity. And we will discontinue providing standalone Neustar reporting at the end of 2023.  Now looking at segment financial performance for the first quarter, US market's revenue was up 3% compared to the year-ago quarter. Organic revenue was flat in the quarter and was up 1%, excluding mortgage.  Adjusted EBITDA for US markets declined 8% on an as reported basis and declined 6% on an organic basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 32.2% for 33.9% on an organic basis. Financial Services, revenue grew 5% as reported and was down 1% organically, excluding Argus.  Excluding mortgage, organic revenue growth was flat despite comparing to a 21% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022 implying a 10% two year growth CAGR. Looking at the individual end-markets, consumer lending revenue declined low-double-digits against a mid-30s growth rate in the year ago quarter.  As expected, lenders are pulling back and investors continue to be selective, but activity remains solid relative to historical levels, particularly in the BNPL space where we continue to see strong activity and new entrants. We are in an advantage position to focus on strategically extending and expanding existing relationships.  The breadth of offerings that we can provide allows us to further penetrate existing accounts with solutions like fraud mitigation, marketing, call center management and advanced analytic capabilities. Many of these capabilities are the results of recent acquisitions, especially Neustar.  Our credit card business was flat against mid-20s growth in the prior year quarter. Issuers continue to market with a focus on gaining top of wallet share with consumers, helping to drive origination activity. They are also benefiting from our relationships with larger firms that are aggressively utilizing digital marketing.  Our auto business delivers 8% growth in the quarter on the strength of continued share gains, strong pre-qualification volumes, the impact of cross-selling Neustar marketing and call center solutions in addition to improving market conditions.  For mortgage, revenue was down only 6% in the quarter, despite origination volumes falling about 47%. The volume declines were offset by pricing, strong HELOC and marketing activity. At this point, refinancing activity is almost non-existent while the purchase market has maintained decent origination levels and been helped by recent, so modest declines in mortgage rates.  On a trailing 12 month basis, mortgage represented about 6% of total TransUnion revenue. For 2023, we now expect the inquiry market to be down roughly 20% and our revenue to increase in the mid-20s. In addition to slightly improved volume expectations, we are seeing a higher share of volume from smaller, end-user customers, which are facing higher third-party pricing markups this year.  Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 1% in the quarter, despite a tough year ago, comparison. Insurance delivered another good quarter. Importantly, we are seeing carriers receive approval for rate increases and beginning to pass those increased prices to consumers, which is driving a recovery in shopping activity.  At this point, insurers have largely limited their marketing activity to brand-oriented campaigns and have yet to substantially reactivate personalized marketing to drive new applications. We remain confident that this recovery will come to fruition over the course of the year and improve the already attractive growth for our insurance vertical.  Tenant and employment screening growth again improved as a result of early signs of a recovery in the tenant market, with month-over-month declines in rental rates, increases and move rates, and an increasing supply of rental units as new construction comes online. This growth was somewhat offset by a softer employment screening market as employers take a more cautious approach to hiring.  Our Media vertical declined in the quarter, as a result of some market softness. Despite that, based on the new business wins we've achieved, we continue to expect the vertical to deliver growth for the full year. Consumer Interactive revenue declined 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 49.2%, up 310 basis points as a result of reduced advertising spending.  Our Direct business continues to decline as we recalibrate our marketing approach to focus on higher value consumers. Thus far, we're seeing good returns on the revamped tactics with better-than-expected, customer acquisition stats at attractive cost to acquire. In our Indirect business, we grew in the first quarter on the strength of new business wins and a modest improvement with some of our partners that offer paid monitoring.  Importantly, we continue to make progress fully integrating Sontiq into our global operating model, which we believe will facilitate increased cross-sell opportunities with existing customers and continue to provide us differentiated features in the market.  For my comments about International, all growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 43.6%, up 80 basis points as a result of our strong revenue growth.  Now, let's dig into the specifics for each region. In the UK, revenue declined 8%. Excluding the revenue related to one-time contracts including with the UK government, we would have grown about 2% in the quarter despite a challenging macro environment. We continue to see strong demand for consumer loans and large banks staying active to satisfy this demand.  At the same time, we have seen good performance for our affordability in trended credit solutions, to help lenders assess portfolio risks. Our Canadian business grew 9% in the first quarter, driven by material business wins with a large bank, a major fintech lender and deepening credit use case in adjacent markets, which contributed to offset a generally softer demand for consumer credit.  In India, we grew 32%, reflecting strong market trends and generally healthy consumers. The diversity of our portfolio remains a real strength in India. We saw meaningful growth in both Consumer and Commercial Credit markets, as well as from fraud, employment screening and direct-to-consumer offerings.  In Latin America, revenue was up 11% with broad-based growth across our markets, including another quarter of double-digit growth for our largest market Columbia. While macro conditions have softened in the region, our teams continue to win new business in financial services, particularly with fintechs and neo banks, insurance, government and telcos. We also continue to see strong adoption of credit vision and our fraud solutions.  In Asia Pacific, we grew 25% from continued good performance in Hong Kong, driven by new business with fintech players and exceptional growth in the Philippines, which is now running well ahead of pre-COVID levels as the economy has now fully re-emerged from COVID and resumed its strong growth trajectory.  Finally, Africa increased 14% based on broadly strong performance across the portfolio, and the region despite a challenging environment in several of our largest markets. In South Africa, core business growth was augmented by continued strength in fast-growing verticals like telco, and gaming. Outside of South Africa, we continue to see very strong revenue growth in markets like Kenya and Zambia, particularly with micro and fintech lenders.  We ended the quarter with roughly $5.6 billion of debt after prepaying $75 million in the quarter. That left us with $439 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.8 times.  At this point, we intend to prepay additional debt in the second quarter and the full year. Looking back, since we announced the acquisition of Neustar in September of 2021, we've prepaid about $1.3 billion of debt. And to reiterate our previous comment, at this time, we have no intention to pursue any large-scale acquisitions and even smaller bolt-on acquisitions are not currently in our plans. We are focused on integrating, and maximizing the growth potential of Neustar, Sontiq and Argus.  That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter. In the second quarter, we expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, there is no impact from acquisitions. We expect revenue to come in between $948 million and $958 million or flat to up 1% on an as reported basis and up 1% to 2% on an organic constant currency basis.  Our revenue guidance includes an approximate one point tailwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business will be flat to up 1% percent on an organic constant currency basis. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $330 million and $335 million, a decrease of 4% to 6%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be down 200 to 220 basis points as a result of the impact of revenue mix.  We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.81, and $0.83, a range of down 15% to 18%, a result of lower adjusted EBITDA and higher interest expense.  Turning to the full year, most of our guidance remains largely unchanged. We expect about one point of headwind from FX on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we anticipate less than 1% of benefit from the acquisition of Argus. We expect revenue to come in between $3.825 billion and $3.885 billion or up 3% to 5% on an as reported basis and in organic constant currency basis and up to 2% to 4% excluding the impact of mortgage.  For our business segments, on an organic basis, we expect US markets to grow mid-single-digits, but low-single-digits without the impact of mortgage. We anticipate Financial Services to be up low-single-digits, and down low-single-digits excluding mortgage. While the overall guidance for Financial Services is unchanged, we have modestly reduced our expectations for Consumer Lending and Card to reflect an uncertain lending environment.  We expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single digits. We can see the benefits of our diversified portfolio playing out and allowing us to maintain our full year revenue guidance. We now anticipate that International will grow, low-double-digits in constant currency terms, up from high-single-digits and driven by ongoing strength in emerging markets and we continue to expect Consumer Interactive to decline, low-single-digits.  Turning back to total company outlook, we expect to adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.388 billion and $1.421 billion, up 3% to 5%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being flat to up 30 basis points with the significant benefits of the Neustar cost savings, partially offset by the inclusion of Argus' relatively lower margin in the first quarter, and some revenue mix considerations.  We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS being flat to declining 4%, with higher interest expense offsetting adjusted EBITDA growth. And we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $525 million and we expect the portion excluding step up amortization from our 2012 change in control, and subsequent acquisitions to be about $225 million.  We anticipate net interest expense will be about $275 million for the full year, down slightly from our previous guidance due to our debt prepayment and a modest reduction in the forward LIBOR curve. And we expect capital expenditures to come in at about 8% of revenue.  I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Yes Andrew, just more specifically on the numbers themselves. As Chris already said, Neustar met our expectations in the first quarter, what I would say is across Communications, Marketing and Risk, we saw all three product lines grow in the quarter. But when we flip back to the to the full year, as we have said on the \u2013 in our prepared remarks, we are expecting high-single-digit growth and what we're seeing in Communications, Marketing and Resolutions is, that all three of those grow high single. For the full year it's our expectation. Hey, good morning. Manav, this is Todd. I'm going to take that question. So, first of all is, as it pertains to the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures, I would say that TransUnion had virtually no revenue exposure to either bank. I think what's important to remember as well too is that, TransUnion's customer base in our core Financial Services.  And this is excluding Neustar and Argus, about a third of our revenues come from our top 20 customers, another third come from our 21st to 100 customers. And then another third of those come from thousands of other customers. So the point there is, we have a very nice diversified base of customers. We're not necessarily upheld in a kind of situation with one particular customer.  As it pertains to the, failures of themselves, I would say that TransUnion saw no direct impact of it. However, we did see an indirect effect and that's just the tightening, the tighter of lending that what Chris has already articulated and we talked about it in our prepared remarks this morning. In particular, just again as a reminder, just to caution that we're taking with Card, Consumer Lending and which we've reflected in our updated guidance.  When we look specifically, at our Consumer Lending LLB with in Financial Services, Consumer Lending, it's where our fintechs residers is probably most held. And I think what's important to remember here is that the growth rectory of the - of this Consumer Lending business has been particularly strong in 2021. We saw really strong growth in \u201822 that growth continued in the mid-teens.  And, right now, we're calling for a high-single-digit decline with that customer base. So what does all that mean? What it means is, on a compounded annual growth rate basis, we're talking about a mid-teen performance for this customer base for the last three years, which is pretty exceptional. And I think what's important also to remember with the fintechs is that this isn't a linear business.  But what they will do is, they will outperform overall lending market over time. A couple other things I think are important to call out with this customer base is, there still demand, both on the customer side as well as on the consumer side and capital is available. Just what we're living through right now is that, our customers are just being more selective as well as their investors are.  And what's encouraging to us is, we've embraced the fintechs since the very beginning and the customers here in this space have gotten more sophisticated and they want to buy our broad based solution suite, which we've only done nothing, but enhance due to our recent acquisitions of Neustar and Argus. And the last point here is, the BNPL part of this area is still growing nicely. I'd be happy to, Faiza. Thank you for the question. So, just kind of grown is in the numbers, our margin in the first quarter was 34.3% and the guidance that we just provided for Q2 is contemplating 34.8% to 35% on the margin. And in the full year it's 36.3% to 36.6%. So, if you take the, kind of the high, of that and figure out what the second half would be for roughly estimating, we need about a 38% adjusted EBITDA margin in the second half.  So it's about 300 basis points higher than the high end of our 2Q guide. Okay, so how are we going to do that? Well, first is just our revenue expectations I think I can't stop without saying. But the second part of that is the synergies pertaining to Neustar only. We spoke about that during our February call. We - of the number, we initially said that the overall synergies and when we announced the acquisition back September 2021 that's going to be $70 million. Back in February, we increased the number to $80 million just based on what we have accomplished in the pretty good line of sight that we have in achieving that.  In addition, to the revenue and the synergies, we're also being very proactive on the cost management side, as we're navigating a very uncertain market. So first we are focused only on making critical hires in areas of strategic importance to us. We've tightened our travel and entertainment and we've eliminated significant one-time spend in our specific consulting engagements. In addition to all of that what also gives us the conviction in the margin that we're also seeing the early benefits of our global approach towards operating TransUnion through our global capability centers, as well as the early benefits that we're continuing to enjoy for our technology transformation which we refer to as Project Rise."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the TransUnion 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Bardi, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreg Bardi: Good morning and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning, and they can also be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses, and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release and the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn it over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright: Thanks, Greg. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I will provide the financial highlights for our third quarter 2024 results. Second, I will detail progress against our transformation program and next milestones. Finally, Todd will detail our third quarter results along with our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 guidance. In the third quarter, TransUnion again exceeded guidance across all key financial metrics. Given the strength in the quarter and ongoing business momentum, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance, which Todd will discuss later. Revenue grew 12% on an organic constant currency basis above our 8% to 10% guidance. Excluding mortgage, our growth of over 8% also exceeded expectations. In the U.S., we continue to experience stable economic and lending conditions. Household finances remain healthy due to low unemployment and some real wage growth, although lower income consumers face affordability pressures from higher shelter, transportation and other expenses. Consumer delinquencies have improved for personal loans and appear to be stabilizing for credit cards and auto loans. In mortgages, delinquencies have risen but remain below historical averages. In September, the Fed announced a 50-basis point interest rate cut with market expectations for further gradual reductions over the next several quarters. We expect an interest rate easing cycle will benefit our volumes over the medium term. In mortgage, we expect there will be a notable refinancing opportunity for loans opened over the last three years, as well as potentially higher purchase activity resulting from improved affordability. Outside of mortgage, we expect lower rates to benefit consumers, who will see lower borrowing costs and our customers, who will benefit from lower funding cost and increased consumer demand. These dynamics are in the context of lending volumes that remain below historical trends. In our U.S. markets segment, revenue grew 12% in the third quarter. Financial services grew 17%, led by over 60% growth in mortgage and growth across all our non-mortgage lines of business. Emerging verticals grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in insurance. Consumer interactive grew 21% due to our large breach remediation wins. In our International segment, we grew by 12% on a constant currency basis, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 23% growth, while Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa all grew double-digits. And finally, we prepaid $25 million in debt during the quarter for a total of $105 million year-to-date with the intent to make additional prepayment in the fourth quarter. Our leverage ratio is on track to be within our near-term target of 3 times or under by year end. As we approach the one-year anniversary of announcing the next step in our transformation, I want to provide an update on the strong execution throughout the year. As a reminder, this phase of our transformation comprises two complementary programs aimed at reducing cost and accelerating innovation. First, we're optimizing our operating model by expanding our global capability center network. Second, we're modernizing our technology capabilities on the state-of-the-art data management and product platforms. Let me detail the progress made to-date in the next steps to complete the programs in 2025 as intended. Our operating model optimization is the continuation of a multi-year journey to build scale across the organization, foster knowledge sharing, and standardize ways of operating. We leverage our Global Capability Centers or GCCs, driving workforce productivity and allowing us to provide more services from talent-rich geographies such as India, South Africa and Costa Rica. Over the last 12 months, we substantially completed the relocation of roughly 1,000 roles from local markets to our GCCs. As of the end of the third quarter, nearly all new positions in the GCCs have been filled. We now have roughly 5,600 employees in our GCC network, largely in India, but with significant presence in Africa and Costa Rica to support 24x7 availability. We also strengthened our local GCC leadership by hiring senior management roles within the regions to support these deep talent pools. A majority of our GCC employees are software developers within our technology, data, and analytics organization. In addition to sizable teams supporting our corporate functions and business transformation efforts. As more work shifts to the GCCs, we're implementing a rigorous playbook to mitigate knowledge transfer risk. Our centralized transition team systematically tracks and documents work processes and develops a feedback loop for continuous process improvement. We also emphasized training, development, and assessment for recent hires to ensure success in their new roles. We're very pleased with the execution of our GCC strategy, which is driving material realized cost savings in 2024. Our focus now is further refining our processes to enhance and expand our best-in-class GCC network. Last quarter, we laid out how we're aligning TransUnion around global technology and product platforms powered by OneTru. Today, I'll focus on the innovative capabilities and product launches in recent months. Earlier this year, we tested and demonstrated that OneTru can materially improve the speed and efficacy of FactorTrust, our short-term credit lending bureau in the U.S. We recently went live with several enhanced capabilities, including triggers, innovation labs, new attributes, and customer prescreens. We plan to migrate FactorTrust customers over the remainder of this year. In 2025, we plan to migrate our primary U.S. credit system customers and decommission the legacy platforms. We also released the first capabilities of TruValidate integrated fraud suite for general availability. The suite produces notable predictive uplift and allows us to deliver our fraud point solutions to customers via a common API. In the third quarter, we signed our first contract for the integrated suite in a competitive win against top fraud vendors. TruIQ Data Enrichment provides instant access to TransUnion credit from within a customer's technology environment. This privacy first approach enables our customers to develop highly targeted marketing campaigns, while retaining control of their sensitive IP. In August, we launched data enrichment on the Snowflake platform to high customer interest with strong new sales and a growing pipeline. We see significant opportunity to embed identity-centric solutions like data enrichment directly within cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake, enabling customers to access our data within the environments of their choice. In our TruAudience marketing solutions, we achieved another key milestone in integrating products and building capabilities. Earlier this year, we unified the underlying identity graphs of our solutions to deliver more accurate identity resolution. This quarter, we consolidated the product, so that customers can experience our identity products on a common and modern user interface with improved features and functionality. Over the next few quarters, we expect to release further enhancement as well as roll out the capability internationally. Finally, we're in the process of migrating our internal big data and analytics environment, which we call SHAPE onto OneTru. SHAPE is frequently the starting point for new product innovation and is also used for customer analytics work, including our innovation labs. And we've onboarded and trained approximately 400 of our data scientists onto OneTru and delivered 10 innovation labs utilizing the platform. We plan to onboard and train all 1,000 plus of our data scientists by the end of this year, allowing us to decommission the legacy SHAPE platform in early 2025. OneTru is accelerating our innovation and enabling new products that resonate with our clients. We've already built a pipeline approaching 50 million and growing from recently introduced OneTru-powered products. Now the early success of OneTru strengthens our conviction in our technology modernization strategy. In addition to delivering continued innovation, 2025 will focus on application development and customer migration. Let me discuss our key initiatives for the coming year. In core U.S. Credit, we aim to have end-to-end capabilities for both online and batch services on OneTru by early next year. We plan to start parallel runs and initial migrations of customers in the first quarter with continued migrations throughout 2025. In India Credit, we are similarly migrating all data and analytics work on the OneTru next year. This will enable us to launch our TruIQ analytics suite and innovation labs into the region. We anticipate strong demand in India for our next generation analytics solutions. We are also well underway in modernizing our consumer solutions technology, which underpins our credit education and identity protection offerings for our indirect channel partners. We plan to consolidate our offerings, including those acquired through Sontiq onto a single global platform. We also plan to launch a comprehensive new interface for our direct-to-consumer product in early 2025. Finally, given the positive early indications of OneTru strengthening our core credit applications, we are evaluating opportunities for further international bureau migrations. Remember that our announced program focused on the U.S. and India through 2025, but we view OneTru as our destination platform for all bureau applications. Next year, we plan to lay the groundwork in four other key markets for their eventual migration to OneTru. We remain on track to complete our transformation program in 2025 with full savings benefits expected in 2026. We continue to expect to incur $355 million to $375 million of one-time expenses to capture the benefits of our transformation programs, including $200 million in 2024. We now expect CapEx to be 8% of revenues in 2024 against a prior expectation of 9%, driven by more efficient spend throughout this year in addition to higher revenues. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 8% of revenues in 2025. We continue to expect to deliver roughly $200 million of free cash flow benefit by 2026, driven by $100 million to $140 million of operating expense savings as well as $70 million to $80 million of CapEx savings as we lower our CapEx requirements to a sustainable 6% of revenues. In 2024, we now expect to deliver $85 million of in-year operating expense savings ahead of our $65 million expectations at the start of the year and supporting almost 100 basis points of margin expansion in the year. The higher savings in 2024 have been largely driven by our people-related actions and expanded GCC network. The remaining $45 million of expected savings will be driven primarily by our technology modernization. We expect to complete the investment program in 2025 and most of the technology cost rationalization will be actioned late in 2025 near the completion of the program. That means that the remaining savings will not be realized until 2026. Taken together, our transformation programs are driving tangible benefits across the organization and will enable us to reach new levels of performance and scale. We look forward to updating you on our accelerating innovation as well as progress against our remaining cost savings targets. Now, Todd will provide further details on our third quarter financial results and our updated full-year 2024 outlook. Todd?\nTodd Cello: Thank you, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we exceeded our guidance across all key financial metrics. Mortgage was the largest driver of our outperformance and our non-mortgage financial services businesses and International segment also contributed positively. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 12% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign currency. Our business grew 8% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, above the high end of our expectations. Margins were down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, which includes an 80-basis point drag from our lower margin breach wins as well as an over 100-basis point impact from lapping last year's lower than typical incentive compensation. Excluding those items, we delivered another strong quarter of underlying margin expansion driven by revenue growth and transformation savings. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.04, an increase of 14%. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, higher than expected due to a recently started internal project to restructure our legal entities to maintain a tax-efficient structure as we expand our global footprint. Finally, in the third quarter, we took $69 million of one-time charges related to our transformation program, $47 million for operating model optimization, primarily related to our planned exit of an office lease, and $22 million for technology transformation. We incurred $145 million of one-time transformation expenses year-to-date. Looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. markets revenue, which includes Consumer Interactive, was up 12%, compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7% or down 120 basis points. Excluding the impact of breach revenues and last year's lower incentive compensation, margins were up strongly. Financial services revenue grew 17%. Excluding mortgage, financial services revenue was up 4%. Trends remain consistent with the last several quarters with year-over-year growth improving sequentially as we start to lap the slowdown in activity from last fall. We outperformed flattish volumes driven by successful cross-sell of our broader solution suite. Our credit card and banking business was, up 5% despite tempered online volumes. This customer segment has seen some of the strongest interest in data enrichment and the broader TruIQ analytics suite in addition to other highly relevant products such as Trusted Call Solutions. Consumer lending revenue grew 2%. FinTech online activity remains muted, but stable with lenders slowly resuming some level of marketing activity. The FinTech market appears to be trending in the right direction and should be a longer-term beneficiary of falling interest rates, which lowers funding costs and supports increased consumer demand, particularly for debt consolidation. Our short-term lending business improved, benefiting from recent wins. Our auto business grew 1%. The market remains choppy across both the new and used car market as consumers face persistent affordability challenges. Against this backdrop, we drove new business wins, including in TruAudience marketing solutions, as well as Trusted Call Solutions. For mortgage, revenue grew 63% ahead of our expectations compared to inquiry volumes down 8%. For the first time this year in late September, we experienced volumes that were ahead of last year's pace as average mortgage rates moved below 6% following the Fed's announcement. Mortgage rates have since crept back above 6%, which has tempered the pace of activity in recent weeks. We continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting fourth quarter volumes even as originations remain significantly below historical averages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented above 10% of total TransUnion revenue. Emerging verticals grew 3% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in insurance. Public sector, tenant and employment, and tech, retail, and e-commerce also grew, offsetting declines in telco and media. Insurance grew double-digits as market trends progressed as anticipated. Insurers continue to gradually increase marketing activity, driving demand for our credit and identity-based marketing solutions. While marketing activity has improved, it remains below levels seen a few years ago as select insurers still work to achieve rate adequacy. Shopping remains strong with increased activity across all demographics. We see good momentum expanding our value proposition to the insurance market with products such as TruVision, Driving History, Trusted Call Solutions, and our fraud and marketing products. And employment returned to growth as we lap the impact of our product recalibration with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter. Public sector grew low-single-digit, led by communications and fraud solutions. Public sector had favorable project timing in the second quarter that reversed in the third quarter, and we expect this vertical to grow low-double-digits for the year. Tech, retail and e-commerce also grew low-single-digit, primarily led by trusted call solutions. Media declined mid-single-digit, lapping mid-teens growth in the prior year, which was aided by one-time project wins. We expect this vertical to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Collections was flat and telco declined low-single-digit, both as expected. Turning to Consumer Interactive. Revenue increased 21%, driven by recent breach remediation wins. Our cross functional teams executed well against these contracts, supporting consumers and building our credibility in this space. Excluding the breach benefit, revenue declined mid-single-digit, primarily due to our direct channel. We are making good progress on broadening our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in direct-to-consumer, and we expect to have more to share in the coming quarters. For my comments about international, our revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.7%, up 110 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 23% with broad-based growth across consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer. While growth remained strong, we experienced some deceleration in the last two quarters. As previously noted, the Reserve Bank of India has tempered the pace of lending activity by tightening regulations on unsecured lending and targeting lower loan-to-deposit ratios industry-wide. This resulted in our online volumes slowing in the third quarter, compared to strong growth throughout the first-half of 2024. We believe the RBI is taking a proactive approach to support financial stability over the long-term as they build a world-class lending market. These actions are also in the context of good GDP growth, inflation in line with historical trends and an overall healthy consumer with delinquencies below long-term averages. In this period of consumer credit tightening in India, we are benefiting from our ongoing product and vertical diversification. Our team is doing an excellent job outgrowing the underlying market, leaning further into our commercial credit solutions and new products like our API marketplace. We are monitoring lending conditions in India and expect strong growth in the fourth quarter. Our U.K. business delivered another quarter of growth, up 4%. The market is trending positively with gradually improving banking and FinTech activity, as well as higher consumer optimism, supported by lower inflation and the Bank of England's first interest rate cut in August. We delivered strong new business, including wins across our FinTech, insurance, government, and gaming verticals. In Canada, we grew 9%. We outperformed flattish market volumes, driven by strategic cross-sell into financial services and alternative lenders, recent breach and consumer indirect wins, and strength in insurance. We anticipate mid-to-high single-digit growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. In Latin America, revenue grew 13%. Colombia grew high-single-digit, outpacing muted volumes. Brazil grew double-digits, supported by new business wins, and our other Latin American countries also grew double-digits. In Asia-Pacific, we grew 11%, led by strength in Philippines and a solid quarter in Hong Kong. Finally, Africa increased 10% with broad-based growth led by our retail vertical. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.2 billion of debt and $643 million of cash. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.1 times. We made a $25 million voluntary repayment in the third quarter for a total of $105 million year-to-date. We expect to make an additional prepayment in the fourth quarter with excess free cash flow after funding our transformation initiatives. Remember that the majority of the roughly $280 million of accrued one-time transformation expenses from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the end of 2024 will be paid out this year. Since announcing our Neustar acquisition, we have voluntarily prepaid $1.6 billion while executing on three refinancing transactions to lower our interest expense and extend our maturity profile. Net of our swaps are all in average effective cost of debt at today's rates is roughly 4.7% below current SOFR. You can find a slide on our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. Based on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be roughly three times by the end of 2024. We continue to target a leverage ratio of under 3 times and view debt prepayment as an attractive use of cash. Turning to guidance. We are pleased with our outperformance over the first three quarters of the year, but our guidance approach remains unchanged. In prior guides this year, we assumed no benefits from interest rate cuts. With the Federal Reserve announcing a 50-basis point interest rate cut in mid-September, we have incorporated modest improvements in mortgage volumes based on what we have experienced over the last few weeks. While we expect interest rate reductions to benefit our broader U.S. financial services business over the long-term, we do not expect those benefits to manifest meaningfully in 2024. We assume muted, but stable lending volumes will persist through the end of the year. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect foreign exchange to have a less than 0.5% impact on revenue and an insignificant impact on adjusted EBITDA. We expect our revenue to be between $1.014 billion and $1.034 billion or up 6% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 5 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 1% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. In terms of other drivers of revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect mortgage revenues to increase over 80% based on roughly 10% volume growth. We continue to expect financial services excluding mortgage to grow mid-single-digit. We expect emerging verticals to accelerate from 3% growth in the third quarter and grow mid-single-digit. We anticipate another quarter of strong growth from international and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline roughly 10% as the business laps a sizable breach win from the prior year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $360 million and $375 million, up 10% to 15%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.5% to 36.2% or up 130 basis points to 210 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.92 and $0.98, up 14% to 21%. Turning to the full-year. We now expect revenue to come in between $4.161 billion and $4.181 billion or up roughly 9% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. We expect our organic constant currency growth excluding mortgage to be up about 5%. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow high-single-digit or up low-single-digit excluding mortgage. Across U.S. markets, Neustar remains well on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2024. We anticipate financial services to be up mid-teens or low-single-digits excluding mortgage. We expect mortgage revenue to increase about 60% based on mortgage inquiries down less than 5% for the year. We now expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single-digit. We expect Consumer Interactive to increase low-single-digit and we expect International to grow low-double-digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.488 billion and $1.503 billion, up 11% to 12%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margins of 35.8% to 36% or up 70 basis points to 90 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $3.87 to $3.93, up 15% to 17%. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23.5%, higher than our previous guidance due to the previously mentioned internal project, which we expect to complete in 2025. We remain focused on maintaining the most efficient tax structure, but expect our future adjusted tax rate to be modestly higher than our recent historical rate given the evolving tax landscape, including initiatives like the global minimum tax. Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be approximately $535 million. We expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $250 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $245 million for the full-year, and we now expect capital expenditures to be about 8% of revenue. We expect to incur approximately $200 million in one-time charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. With today's guidance raise, we have raised our revenue expectations over the course of the year by $161 million, adjusted EBITDA by $62 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. Our revenue increase has been driven by stronger mortgage revenues, large breach remediation wins and broad-based business momentum. We also modestly increased our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations, despite adding lower margin breach revenue, supported by revenue flow-through and higher in-year transformation savings. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up, we exceeded third quarter expectations driven primarily by U.S. financial services and international. We're executing well against our transformation program, driving material savings and a step change improvement in innovation with several new capability and product launches powered by OneTru. We're raising our 2024 guidance and expect to deliver strong high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-teens adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for the year. Now let me turn it back to Greg.\nGreg Bardi: That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question, so that we can include more participants. Operator, we can begin the Q&A.\nOperator: And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, good morning, and thank you. So, Chris, I wanted to touch on your comments around OneTru and the transformation. You talked about around $50 million, I think, of pipeline related to OneTru products. I'm curious if we should consider those potentially as incremental revenues and how should we think about really the additional revenue benefit from the transformation as we look ahead to '25 and beyond?\nChris Cartwright: Okay. Well, good morning, Faiza. Thank you for the question and welcome everybody to the Q3 call. OneTru is having a very profound impact on our business and our ability to compete in a variety of product lines and markets. I think what's been most exciting is completing the integration phase of the acquisitions and the tech transformation that we've been doing and pivoting really to strong innovation. Over the past couple of quarters in earnings and in press releases, you've seen us announce a whole series of product innovations in analytics, in marketing solutions, in fraud, in credit for short-term unsecured lending. And I think the market should get used to this elevated pace of innovation, which is going to buttress our revenue growth and our revenue forecasts as we roll into next year. Recently, you may have seen an announcement of the next gen of our TruAudience marketing solutions, we've brought together the best of Neustar and the best of TransUnion marketing solutions for identity resolution and market segmentation and audience generation and onboarding with a new user interface onto the OneTru platform. And over the course of '25, we have quarterly robust product functional improvements in the pipeline. The story is the same on the fraud side. We've launched TruValidate, which is our brand name for our global fraud solutions. And again, we've integrated our various very strong point solutions for e-commerce fraud mitigation and just transaction authentication onto a common platform. Our predictive models are far more performant. We are winning new clients. And so we pointed to kind of a cumulative $50 million bookings benefit at this point that is driven directly from that innovation. I can say that over the last couple of quarters, our sales of marketing products have improved materially. And again, that's against a pretty tepid advertising and marketing environment as CMOs have had the belt tighten in a more difficult revenue environment and just a less aggressive posture toward client acquisition. I think as rates come down in 2025 and we achieve this soft landing and if economic macro conditions continue to be stable as they are or even improving, you could see consumer -- or rather our customers pivot more toward acquisition, which again would benefit. So I mean, I think before I say it's additive since we haven't guided to 2025, I just think it certainly derisks our belief that we can return to steady high-single-digit revenue compounding over the intermediate term. And that's really the goal. And look, the good news is we are guiding to that type of growth in 2024 with this raise. And we've yet to see any real strengthening in our end markets. We've just gone from a negative volume environment over the past 18 months to 24 months to one where we have stable, but still muted market conditions and we're demonstrating how growthful we can be given all of our products, given our geographic spread and the stability that we're now enjoying.\nFaiza Alwy: Great. Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi, could you just tell us your assumptions around the consumer credit activity kind of through the fourth quarter and the guide? And do you anticipate that there's a direction as we head into next year around credit activity.\nTodd Cello: Good morning, Andrew. This is Todd. I'll take that question. Let's answer it specifically from financial services excluding mortgage, right? And the trajectory that we're seeing. So as you saw in the third quarter, we grew 4% on that basis, which was a bit better than the low-single-digit expectations that we had. As you just heard Chris say, volumes, they're stable, but they're still muted. So you look at that in -- at more of a flattish perspective. And when you look at the comparables to the prior year, needless to say, it's important to look that we're lapping the slowdown and the headwind that Chris again just had alluded to. So as we look into the fourth quarter, we are expecting mid-single-digit growth here in this space, as we're just considering that the conditions persist and the comparisons will also ease. I think what's important here is that we're not assuming that there is any type of material benefit from the recent actions that the Federal Reserve took with interest rate reductions. However, we do believe that we will be a medium-term beneficiary of those rate cuts. So more as we get into 2025. And as we look at the lines of business within financial services, excluding mortgage, I mean, consumer lending is one that we would say is a little bit more rate sensitive. And as I'm sure you know, this is where the vast majority of our FinTech customers reside. And it's kind of two-pronged here. First, with lower rates, the FinTechs have cheaper access to capital, which then improves their funding models. But then on the demand side, if rates are lower, you'll see consumers look for products such as debt consolidation. So rate sensitivity there is impactful, and we should see a benefit. If you look at our auto business, the lower rates are aiding affordability. Vehicle prices have gone up significantly since before the pandemic. So a lower rate environment will help. There's also a potential refi opportunity in the auto space as well too. When you think about how auto loans were taken out at very high levels of interest rates, there could be an opportunity there as well in the medium term. Thinking about the credit card business, probably a limited impact that rates are going to have there. And then finally, when we think about the banking side of the equation, the small and medium-sized lenders, as we talked about a year ago, this group felt outsized pain from higher rates as well as dislocation of deposits last year in the wake of a couple of banking failures. So we look at that group of customers which TransUnion is well positioned in that lower interest rates again in the medium term should help.\nAndrew Steinerman: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about mortgage. You talk -- could you just talk about the delta between the mortgage revenue growth and inquiries? I'm sure a lot of this is coming from the FICO price increase, but maybe just help with some other drivers, just given the large delta it accelerated from the last couple of quarters? And maybe if I could just tag on really quickly, the inquiries of down about 8% looks a little bit light compared to peers and third-party sources. So anything to read into the inquiries as well? Thank you.\nTodd Cello: Good morning, Toni. Thanks for that question, and that's an important one for us to go through the details on. So as you stated, our mortgage volumes in Q3 did decline 8%. What's important there to call out though is that's as we expected it. So we're pretty much right in line with how we felt volumes were going to come in at the beginning of the quarter. One thing that is important to remember, when you look at the volumes that TransUnion reports for mortgage, we include everything that's mortgage in that number, including pre-qualification. So other numbers that you may see in the market maybe don't compare on a like-for-like basis. So that's an important distinction there as well. The early access program grew in the third quarter, but the growth was moderating as we lap the program ramp that started in the second half of 2023. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did see volume start to turn positive in late September as mortgage rates were 6% or below. But since then we've seen rates creep back up. And so we've seen the tri-merge volumes in mortgage, you know, decline. But we've changed our guidance though because of what we've seen with rate cuts and just a handful of weeks of performance in mortgage. And as you can see, we are now calling for a 10% increase in the fourth quarter, which if you think about it from a seasonality perspective, it's typically very low. But then historically, we had a very weak fourth quarter of 2023. So there is definitely a comparable that you have to take into consideration. And now we're expecting from the little bit of benefit that we're getting from the rate reduction that we're expecting the second-half volumes to be roughly flat where last time we spoke with you, we were talking about a 5% decline. Now to your question specific about the gap between the revenues and the volumes. In the third quarter, we posted 63% growth, but as I've already said, volumes were down 8%, so that delta is about 71%, if you do the math on that one. And then for what we're guiding basically for the fourth quarter, with a 10% increase in volume, in essence is assuming 80% in revenue. So what we're seeing here is just a positive mix and price from TransUnion's products and this includes the pre-qual shift to early access plus the reporting that we put on our own credit products as well. And I guess one last point too is when you look at our mortgage revenues, another important thing to remember is that there's more than just online volumes in our mortgages. So we -- in particular, we work with mortgage lenders to help them target and prospect consumers that may be in the market for a mortgage. So we're starting to see that business pick up in a meaningful way.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. So I just -- how fully do you feel the RBI actions have been felt on the market and your financial services business or consumer credit business within India at this point? And then just anything you can say, I know it's a diversified information solutions business. So is growth as strong as ever kind of outside the U.S. consumer credit business in India. I know you said growth should remain strong. I'm just not quite sure what that means in the context of 23% but decelerating growth recently. Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Okay, Jeff, I'll take the India question. And I'm going to take your question about the diversification component as applying to India and not to the U.S. markets.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, it's correct.\nChris Cartwright: Correct me if you\u2026\nJeff Meuler: Correct.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. So as we pointed out in -- I think the last call, the RBI has become concerned over the pace of lending growth across the Indian marketplace and has taken certain actions to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio in that market. We view it as a prudent step to ensure kind of the stability and the soundness of lending practices within India, which year-on-year had been growing very rapidly. And I think the RBI is going to kind of maintain that for the coming quarters until they're comfortable that there's real integrity across all the lending practices, particularly unsecured lending, which they've scrutinized more highly. I think it's important to remember that India is an amazing market for all the reasons that we've talked about in prior calls, population growth, economic growth, penetration of financial products, and general innovation. And India wants to create a world-class financial services marketplace. And I think the actions by the RBI are toward that end. The lending market continues to be very strong. Delinquencies are at three-year lows. So there's not really a specific problem. And if you look at some of the recent actions against specific lenders, they were more concerned that the appropriate interest rates were being charged to consumers, not an excess interest rate. So it had the flavor of anti-usury if you will, and also that banks were properly diligencing the affordability of loans for consumers. So really, we just view it as a prudent and conservative posture by the RBI to ensure that they don't suffer a boom and then bust cycle. I think we got to remember that we're accelerating our growth outside of core consumer lending, while we're also expanding the number of use cases within consumer lending that we can serve, particularly agri lending and other small-dollar lending, micro lending, if you will, and increasing the analytic products that we're bringing to consumer lending. But the team is confident that we can continue to produce this outsized growth for the intermediate future because of the diversification in commercial, in direct-to-consumer, in fraud, and marketing solutions as we bring them and just a whole array of new analytic products that we can bring across the Indian marketplace. So while growth has slowed from the low-30s to the low-20s, we still expect this market to compound over the next three, five years at very attractive rates and we'll guide more to that effect in the early part of next year.\nJeff Meuler: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could talk about what's driving the improvement in emerging verticals in the fourth quarter. And as you think about going forward with some of these innovations from OneTru, how should we think about that momentum going forward? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. So emerging verticals in the U.S. grew 3% in the third quarter. It's down a touch from the 4% growth rate we achieved in the first couple of quarters, we don't really view it as a concern. We think things will accelerate and we'll be back mid-single-digits for the fourth quarter and for the full-year. I mean, on a quarterly basis, there's always some lumpiness or noise. In the third quarter for emerging public sector, which is a lumpy business, grew, but not as fast as it typically does and will for the full year. We were also lapping some very large comps in media. You may recall next year; we had a big media quarter in the third quarter of '23 and so there was a difficult comp there. The good news is that insurance is returning to its former growthfulness, and we saw some double-digit growth, low-double-digit growth in the -- in the third quarter, technology, retail and e-commerce, solid, tenant and employment screening, et cetera, still looking good. So our prospects are improving, and momentum is improving in emerging verticals. And again, we saw a lot of marketing and fraud solutions into emerging, and I feel like we're pretty well positioned to deliver a good year of growth and continue into next year.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So we've seen really strong growth in Canada for the last few quarters and I think you previously mentioned that part of the strength comes from share gains. So I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around what has worked really well in that market and what level of medium-term growth rate we should expect going forward?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Thank you, Kelsey. So I've been in the business for 11-years now, and for 10 of them, we've had outsized growth rates in Canada and that team has done a great job of consistently gaining market share. The playbook has been consistent innovation. They have done a great job of innovating in country, but also importing just a range of relevant product innovations from the U.S. and adapting it to the Canadian market. We were also the first mover in launching trended data in the Canadian market and we've got a very rich trended dataset, many attributes that perform extremely well vis-a-vis our competition and we've been able just to bring down shingles year-after-year in Canada. And I expect that the team will continue to do so. Now we're starting to lap some very large growth rates in a mature market. And so the rate of growth is going to decelerate from the mid and sometimes high teens that we've enjoyed over these last few quarters. But the Canadian team knows what they're doing. They're going to continue to innovate, they're going to continue to focus on ways to make Canadian lenders more effective and more profitable. And I think we're going to do quite well going forward.\nKelsey Zhu: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Haas with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJason Haas: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm curious to focus on the Consumer Interactive segment. I'm curious if trends worsened excluding that breach. It sounds like maybe that was due to DTC. And then I'm just curious what can drive sort of improvement there going forward? Thanks.\nChris Cartwright: Yes, thanks for the question, Jason. Direct-to-consumer in the consumer business overall remains an area of intense focus for innovation, and we've talked a lot about it in recent quarters. I feel like we're still on the path to deliver what we need to strategically to return this business to growth. Now, look, in any one quarter you're going to have some noise, but it's important to understand that on the direct-to-consumer side, we are broadening the value proposition and improving our go-to-market strategy, so that we can better monetize the audience that we're getting: one, just our natural flow given our brand in the U.S., but also through our marketing efforts, which we've continued to fine tune to be both effective and entirely compliant. When I talk about broadening the value proposition, I mean, obviously, we've got to bring all things credit to the consumer. We've got to have education and access and simulation and we're good at that. But we've been able to bring identity protection and breach remediation services. And I believe in the relatively near future, we will also launch offers capability, which has been a missing link to the component and we're very excited about bringing that capability to the U.S. markets and beyond and enabling our indirect business to bring the full complement of consumer solutions, which again is credit, identity protection, breach mitigation and a financial and insurance offers engine, right? So that's kind of the strategy and we are making great progress in delivering that. And in fact, that will probably become a focal point of an upcoming earnings call. So that's what I would say about consumer.\nJason Haas: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Chris, I just wanted to understand the expected drop in CapEx from 8% to 6% in '26. I think part of it might just be your expectations of high-single-digit top line growth, maybe a bigger revenue base, but maybe just trying to appreciate, perhaps the power of all the spend in the tech platform because I imagine there's always going to be the need to spend on analytics, software, data, et cetera. So a whole two-point drop seems like a lot assuming things keep changing.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Manav. There is a bit of a revenue element, but it's secondary. The core is that we're actually achieving the technology transformation with a lower level of spend. Now when we announced in the early fourth quarter of last year, this current chapter of the transformation, which is really the two components of an operating model shift, we're relocating more work to the GCCs, but also an acceleration of technology investment on the backs of Project Rise to consolidate applications on the platform. We're just getting that done with a lower level of spend this year. And so we've reduced guidance on our CapEx to 8% from 9%, but it really has to do from effectiveness. Now some of these other areas that you mentioned, they are important areas of investment. We're continuing to invest disproportionately in innovation, but not all of it is capitalized, right? So the component that is capitalizable, we're getting the work done with less, and so I think it's good news.\nTodd Cello: And Manav I would add on to it because I think you're more referring to how do we get to 6% of revenue in 2026, like is there any risk? Are we foregoing anything? An important thing to remember here is that we're migrating all of our applications to the cloud. And by doing that, we no longer have the need for hardware and software purchases, which historically would have been capital expenditures. So now as we have cloud computing costs, that comes into the P&L as an operating expense as opposed to a capital expense that we would depreciate over the life. So what's left in that capital spend when we get to 2026 is primarily our innovation. It's the internally developed software to develop our products and services for our customers.\nChris Cartwright: Yes. And the other wrinkle on that is, given that we are actually consolidating on a global platform and not just migrating the same stuff to the cloud, we will have fewer systems to care and feed for and we can concentrate our engineering on a common configurable global platform. And I think that's really going to be a point of leverage in our earnings and our innovation going forward.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Hello, Simon, your line may be muted.\nSimon Clinch: Apologies that was muted. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the longer-term sort of competitive environment in what has historically been a very stable core credit business for the credit bureaus. As your -- you and your peers are all developing new products and there's a greater capability of sort of, I guess, bundling additional services beyond just the traditional credit file into these revenue streams and for your customers? And I was just wondering if you expect that to change the intensity of competition or anything like that in the long-term and how you would be able to compete in that environment?\nChris Cartwright: Yes. Thank you for the question. So look my perspective is that each of the bureaus provide great data and analytics and serve our customers well and that there is a good competitive intensity and a lot of innovation. I mean, if you look over the decade that I've been here, lots of innovation. Each of the three of us have differentiated value propositions and I think you know what those are. I don't necessarily view this as a zero some type competition. I view it as -- each of the bureaus expanding the range of services and the value they can add to clients to gain share of spending, to gain wallet share, if you will. And I think we'll each pursue our somewhat differentiated strategies to accomplish that. But net-net, this is an expanding market. There's a lot of work that clients do internally that I think the bureaus are well positioned to take over and incorporate into their value propositions. And then I also think that it's just data and analytics is hugely important to lenders, insurers, and the entire client base operating effectively. And so they're willing to pay premiums for quality data and insights that help them manage their broader P&Ls more effectively. So I think that's why it's a great business. There's a constant stream of innovation, we can prove the value that we add, and I think TransUnion is certainly well positioned to grow with and above the market across the geographies that we compete in.\nGreg Bardi: Perfect. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thank you for your time and have a great rest of the day. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we exceeded our guidance across all key financial metrics. Mortgage was the largest driver of our outperformance and our non-mortgage financial services businesses and International segment also contributed positively. Third quarter consolidated revenue increased 12% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign currency. Our business grew 8% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the third quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3%, above the high end of our expectations. Margins were down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, which includes an 80-basis point drag from our lower margin breach wins as well as an over 100-basis point impact from lapping last year's lower than typical incentive compensation. Excluding those items, we delivered another strong quarter of underlying margin expansion driven by revenue growth and transformation savings. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.04, an increase of 14%. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, higher than expected due to a recently started internal project to restructure our legal entities to maintain a tax-efficient structure as we expand our global footprint. Finally, in the third quarter, we took $69 million of one-time charges related to our transformation program, $47 million for operating model optimization, primarily related to our planned exit of an office lease, and $22 million for technology transformation. We incurred $145 million of one-time transformation expenses year-to-date. Looking at segment financial performance for the third quarter. U.S. markets revenue, which includes Consumer Interactive, was up 12%, compared to the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.7% or down 120 basis points. Excluding the impact of breach revenues and last year's lower incentive compensation, margins were up strongly. Financial services revenue grew 17%. Excluding mortgage, financial services revenue was up 4%. Trends remain consistent with the last several quarters with year-over-year growth improving sequentially as we start to lap the slowdown in activity from last fall. We outperformed flattish volumes driven by successful cross-sell of our broader solution suite. Our credit card and banking business was, up 5% despite tempered online volumes. This customer segment has seen some of the strongest interest in data enrichment and the broader TruIQ analytics suite in addition to other highly relevant products such as Trusted Call Solutions. Consumer lending revenue grew 2%. FinTech online activity remains muted, but stable with lenders slowly resuming some level of marketing activity. The FinTech market appears to be trending in the right direction and should be a longer-term beneficiary of falling interest rates, which lowers funding costs and supports increased consumer demand, particularly for debt consolidation. Our short-term lending business improved, benefiting from recent wins. Our auto business grew 1%. The market remains choppy across both the new and used car market as consumers face persistent affordability challenges. Against this backdrop, we drove new business wins, including in TruAudience marketing solutions, as well as Trusted Call Solutions. For mortgage, revenue grew 63% ahead of our expectations compared to inquiry volumes down 8%. For the first time this year in late September, we experienced volumes that were ahead of last year's pace as average mortgage rates moved below 6% following the Fed's announcement. Mortgage rates have since crept back above 6%, which has tempered the pace of activity in recent weeks. We continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting fourth quarter volumes even as originations remain significantly below historical averages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented above 10% of total TransUnion revenue. Emerging verticals grew 3% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in insurance. Public sector, tenant and employment, and tech, retail, and e-commerce also grew, offsetting declines in telco and media. Insurance grew double-digits as market trends progressed as anticipated. Insurers continue to gradually increase marketing activity, driving demand for our credit and identity-based marketing solutions. While marketing activity has improved, it remains below levels seen a few years ago as select insurers still work to achieve rate adequacy. Shopping remains strong with increased activity across all demographics. We see good momentum expanding our value proposition to the insurance market with products such as TruVision, Driving History, Trusted Call Solutions, and our fraud and marketing products. And employment returned to growth as we lap the impact of our product recalibration with further improvement expected in the fourth quarter. Public sector grew low-single-digit, led by communications and fraud solutions. Public sector had favorable project timing in the second quarter that reversed in the third quarter, and we expect this vertical to grow low-double-digits for the year. Tech, retail and e-commerce also grew low-single-digit, primarily led by trusted call solutions. Media declined mid-single-digit, lapping mid-teens growth in the prior year, which was aided by one-time project wins. We expect this vertical to return to growth in the fourth quarter. Collections was flat and telco declined low-single-digit, both as expected. Turning to Consumer Interactive. Revenue increased 21%, driven by recent breach remediation wins. Our cross functional teams executed well against these contracts, supporting consumers and building our credibility in this space. Excluding the breach benefit, revenue declined mid-single-digit, primarily due to our direct channel. We are making good progress on broadening our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in direct-to-consumer, and we expect to have more to share in the coming quarters. For my comments about international, our revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 12% with four of our six reported markets growing by double-digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.7%, up 110 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 23% with broad-based growth across consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer. While growth remained strong, we experienced some deceleration in the last two quarters. As previously noted, the Reserve Bank of India has tempered the pace of lending activity by tightening regulations on unsecured lending and targeting lower loan-to-deposit ratios industry-wide. This resulted in our online volumes slowing in the third quarter, compared to strong growth throughout the first-half of 2024. We believe the RBI is taking a proactive approach to support financial stability over the long-term as they build a world-class lending market. These actions are also in the context of good GDP growth, inflation in line with historical trends and an overall healthy consumer with delinquencies below long-term averages. In this period of consumer credit tightening in India, we are benefiting from our ongoing product and vertical diversification. Our team is doing an excellent job outgrowing the underlying market, leaning further into our commercial credit solutions and new products like our API marketplace. We are monitoring lending conditions in India and expect strong growth in the fourth quarter. Our U.K. business delivered another quarter of growth, up 4%. The market is trending positively with gradually improving banking and FinTech activity, as well as higher consumer optimism, supported by lower inflation and the Bank of England's first interest rate cut in August. We delivered strong new business, including wins across our FinTech, insurance, government, and gaming verticals. In Canada, we grew 9%. We outperformed flattish market volumes, driven by strategic cross-sell into financial services and alternative lenders, recent breach and consumer indirect wins, and strength in insurance. We anticipate mid-to-high single-digit growth from Canada in the fourth quarter. In Latin America, revenue grew 13%. Colombia grew high-single-digit, outpacing muted volumes. Brazil grew double-digits, supported by new business wins, and our other Latin American countries also grew double-digits. In Asia-Pacific, we grew 11%, led by strength in Philippines and a solid quarter in Hong Kong. Finally, Africa increased 10% with broad-based growth led by our retail vertical. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.2 billion of debt and $643 million of cash. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.1 times. We made a $25 million voluntary repayment in the third quarter for a total of $105 million year-to-date. We expect to make an additional prepayment in the fourth quarter with excess free cash flow after funding our transformation initiatives. Remember that the majority of the roughly $280 million of accrued one-time transformation expenses from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the end of 2024 will be paid out this year. Since announcing our Neustar acquisition, we have voluntarily prepaid $1.6 billion while executing on three refinancing transactions to lower our interest expense and extend our maturity profile. Net of our swaps are all in average effective cost of debt at today's rates is roughly 4.7% below current SOFR. You can find a slide on our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. Based on our expectations for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be roughly three times by the end of 2024. We continue to target a leverage ratio of under 3 times and view debt prepayment as an attractive use of cash. Turning to guidance. We are pleased with our outperformance over the first three quarters of the year, but our guidance approach remains unchanged. In prior guides this year, we assumed no benefits from interest rate cuts. With the Federal Reserve announcing a 50-basis point interest rate cut in mid-September, we have incorporated modest improvements in mortgage volumes based on what we have experienced over the last few weeks. While we expect interest rate reductions to benefit our broader U.S. financial services business over the long-term, we do not expect those benefits to manifest meaningfully in 2024. We assume muted, but stable lending volumes will persist through the end of the year. That brings us to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect foreign exchange to have a less than 0.5% impact on revenue and an insignificant impact on adjusted EBITDA. We expect our revenue to be between $1.014 billion and $1.034 billion or up 6% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately 5 points of tailwind from mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 1% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. In terms of other drivers of revenue in the fourth quarter, we expect mortgage revenues to increase over 80% based on roughly 10% volume growth. We continue to expect financial services excluding mortgage to grow mid-single-digit. We expect emerging verticals to accelerate from 3% growth in the third quarter and grow mid-single-digit. We anticipate another quarter of strong growth from international and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline roughly 10% as the business laps a sizable breach win from the prior year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $360 million and $375 million, up 10% to 15%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.5% to 36.2% or up 130 basis points to 210 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.92 and $0.98, up 14% to 21%. Turning to the full-year. We now expect revenue to come in between $4.161 billion and $4.181 billion or up roughly 9% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. We expect our organic constant currency growth excluding mortgage to be up about 5%. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow high-single-digit or up low-single-digit excluding mortgage. Across U.S. markets, Neustar remains well on track for mid-single-digit growth in 2024. We anticipate financial services to be up mid-teens or low-single-digits excluding mortgage. We expect mortgage revenue to increase about 60% based on mortgage inquiries down less than 5% for the year. We now expect emerging verticals to be up mid-single-digit. We expect Consumer Interactive to increase low-single-digit and we expect International to grow low-double-digits. Turning back to total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.488 billion and $1.503 billion, up 11% to 12%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margins of 35.8% to 36% or up 70 basis points to 90 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $3.87 to $3.93, up 15% to 17%. We now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23.5%, higher than our previous guidance due to the previously mentioned internal project, which we expect to complete in 2025. We remain focused on maintaining the most efficient tax structure, but expect our future adjusted tax rate to be modestly higher than our recent historical rate given the evolving tax landscape, including initiatives like the global minimum tax. Depreciation and amortization is now expected to be approximately $535 million. We expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $250 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $245 million for the full-year, and we now expect capital expenditures to be about 8% of revenue. We expect to incur approximately $200 million in one-time charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. With today's guidance raise, we have raised our revenue expectations over the course of the year by $161 million, adjusted EBITDA by $62 million, and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. Our revenue increase has been driven by stronger mortgage revenues, large breach remediation wins and broad-based business momentum. We also modestly increased our adjusted EBITDA margin expectations, despite adding lower margin breach revenue, supported by revenue flow-through and higher in-year transformation savings. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Good morning, Andrew. This is Todd. I'll take that question. Let's answer it specifically from financial services excluding mortgage, right? And the trajectory that we're seeing. So as you saw in the third quarter, we grew 4% on that basis, which was a bit better than the low-single-digit expectations that we had. As you just heard Chris say, volumes, they're stable, but they're still muted. So you look at that in -- at more of a flattish perspective. And when you look at the comparables to the prior year, needless to say, it's important to look that we're lapping the slowdown and the headwind that Chris again just had alluded to. So as we look into the fourth quarter, we are expecting mid-single-digit growth here in this space, as we're just considering that the conditions persist and the comparisons will also ease. I think what's important here is that we're not assuming that there is any type of material benefit from the recent actions that the Federal Reserve took with interest rate reductions. However, we do believe that we will be a medium-term beneficiary of those rate cuts. So more as we get into 2025. And as we look at the lines of business within financial services, excluding mortgage, I mean, consumer lending is one that we would say is a little bit more rate sensitive. And as I'm sure you know, this is where the vast majority of our FinTech customers reside. And it's kind of two-pronged here. First, with lower rates, the FinTechs have cheaper access to capital, which then improves their funding models. But then on the demand side, if rates are lower, you'll see consumers look for products such as debt consolidation. So rate sensitivity there is impactful, and we should see a benefit. If you look at our auto business, the lower rates are aiding affordability. Vehicle prices have gone up significantly since before the pandemic. So a lower rate environment will help. There's also a potential refi opportunity in the auto space as well too. When you think about how auto loans were taken out at very high levels of interest rates, there could be an opportunity there as well in the medium term. Thinking about the credit card business, probably a limited impact that rates are going to have there. And then finally, when we think about the banking side of the equation, the small and medium-sized lenders, as we talked about a year ago, this group felt outsized pain from higher rates as well as dislocation of deposits last year in the wake of a couple of banking failures. So we look at that group of customers which TransUnion is well positioned in that lower interest rates again in the medium term should help. Good morning, Toni. Thanks for that question, and that's an important one for us to go through the details on. So as you stated, our mortgage volumes in Q3 did decline 8%. What's important there to call out though is that's as we expected it. So we're pretty much right in line with how we felt volumes were going to come in at the beginning of the quarter. One thing that is important to remember, when you look at the volumes that TransUnion reports for mortgage, we include everything that's mortgage in that number, including pre-qualification. So other numbers that you may see in the market maybe don't compare on a like-for-like basis. So that's an important distinction there as well. The early access program grew in the third quarter, but the growth was moderating as we lap the program ramp that started in the second half of 2023. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did see volume start to turn positive in late September as mortgage rates were 6% or below. But since then we've seen rates creep back up. And so we've seen the tri-merge volumes in mortgage, you know, decline. But we've changed our guidance though because of what we've seen with rate cuts and just a handful of weeks of performance in mortgage. And as you can see, we are now calling for a 10% increase in the fourth quarter, which if you think about it from a seasonality perspective, it's typically very low. But then historically, we had a very weak fourth quarter of 2023. So there is definitely a comparable that you have to take into consideration. And now we're expecting from the little bit of benefit that we're getting from the rate reduction that we're expecting the second-half volumes to be roughly flat where last time we spoke with you, we were talking about a 5% decline. Now to your question specific about the gap between the revenues and the volumes. In the third quarter, we posted 63% growth, but as I've already said, volumes were down 8%, so that delta is about 71%, if you do the math on that one. And then for what we're guiding basically for the fourth quarter, with a 10% increase in volume, in essence is assuming 80% in revenue. So what we're seeing here is just a positive mix and price from TransUnion's products and this includes the pre-qual shift to early access plus the reporting that we put on our own credit products as well. And I guess one last point too is when you look at our mortgage revenues, another important thing to remember is that there's more than just online volumes in our mortgages. So we -- in particular, we work with mortgage lenders to help them target and prospect consumers that may be in the market for a mortgage. So we're starting to see that business pick up in a meaningful way. And Manav I would add on to it because I think you're more referring to how do we get to 6% of revenue in 2026, like is there any risk? Are we foregoing anything? An important thing to remember here is that we're migrating all of our applications to the cloud. And by doing that, we no longer have the need for hardware and software purchases, which historically would have been capital expenditures. So now as we have cloud computing costs, that comes into the P&L as an operating expense as opposed to a capital expense that we would depreciate over the life. So what's left in that capital spend when we get to 2026 is primarily our innovation. It's the internally developed software to develop our products and services for our customers."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I will provide the financial highlights for our third quarter 2024 results. Second, I will detail progress against our transformation program and next milestones. Finally, Todd will detail our third quarter results along with our fourth quarter and full-year 2024 guidance. In the third quarter, TransUnion again exceeded guidance across all key financial metrics. Given the strength in the quarter and ongoing business momentum, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance, which Todd will discuss later. Revenue grew 12% on an organic constant currency basis above our 8% to 10% guidance. Excluding mortgage, our growth of over 8% also exceeded expectations. In the U.S., we continue to experience stable economic and lending conditions. Household finances remain healthy due to low unemployment and some real wage growth, although lower income consumers face affordability pressures from higher shelter, transportation and other expenses. Consumer delinquencies have improved for personal loans and appear to be stabilizing for credit cards and auto loans. In mortgages, delinquencies have risen but remain below historical averages. In September, the Fed announced a 50-basis point interest rate cut with market expectations for further gradual reductions over the next several quarters. We expect an interest rate easing cycle will benefit our volumes over the medium term. In mortgage, we expect there will be a notable refinancing opportunity for loans opened over the last three years, as well as potentially higher purchase activity resulting from improved affordability. Outside of mortgage, we expect lower rates to benefit consumers, who will see lower borrowing costs and our customers, who will benefit from lower funding cost and increased consumer demand. These dynamics are in the context of lending volumes that remain below historical trends. In our U.S. markets segment, revenue grew 12% in the third quarter. Financial services grew 17%, led by over 60% growth in mortgage and growth across all our non-mortgage lines of business. Emerging verticals grew 3%, driven by double-digit growth in insurance. Consumer interactive grew 21% due to our large breach remediation wins. In our International segment, we grew by 12% on a constant currency basis, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 23% growth, while Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and Africa all grew double-digits. And finally, we prepaid $25 million in debt during the quarter for a total of $105 million year-to-date with the intent to make additional prepayment in the fourth quarter. Our leverage ratio is on track to be within our near-term target of 3 times or under by year end. As we approach the one-year anniversary of announcing the next step in our transformation, I want to provide an update on the strong execution throughout the year. As a reminder, this phase of our transformation comprises two complementary programs aimed at reducing cost and accelerating innovation. First, we're optimizing our operating model by expanding our global capability center network. Second, we're modernizing our technology capabilities on the state-of-the-art data management and product platforms. Let me detail the progress made to-date in the next steps to complete the programs in 2025 as intended. Our operating model optimization is the continuation of a multi-year journey to build scale across the organization, foster knowledge sharing, and standardize ways of operating. We leverage our Global Capability Centers or GCCs, driving workforce productivity and allowing us to provide more services from talent-rich geographies such as India, South Africa and Costa Rica. Over the last 12 months, we substantially completed the relocation of roughly 1,000 roles from local markets to our GCCs. As of the end of the third quarter, nearly all new positions in the GCCs have been filled. We now have roughly 5,600 employees in our GCC network, largely in India, but with significant presence in Africa and Costa Rica to support 24x7 availability. We also strengthened our local GCC leadership by hiring senior management roles within the regions to support these deep talent pools. A majority of our GCC employees are software developers within our technology, data, and analytics organization. In addition to sizable teams supporting our corporate functions and business transformation efforts. As more work shifts to the GCCs, we're implementing a rigorous playbook to mitigate knowledge transfer risk. Our centralized transition team systematically tracks and documents work processes and develops a feedback loop for continuous process improvement. We also emphasized training, development, and assessment for recent hires to ensure success in their new roles. We're very pleased with the execution of our GCC strategy, which is driving material realized cost savings in 2024. Our focus now is further refining our processes to enhance and expand our best-in-class GCC network. Last quarter, we laid out how we're aligning TransUnion around global technology and product platforms powered by OneTru. Today, I'll focus on the innovative capabilities and product launches in recent months. Earlier this year, we tested and demonstrated that OneTru can materially improve the speed and efficacy of FactorTrust, our short-term credit lending bureau in the U.S. We recently went live with several enhanced capabilities, including triggers, innovation labs, new attributes, and customer prescreens. We plan to migrate FactorTrust customers over the remainder of this year. In 2025, we plan to migrate our primary U.S. credit system customers and decommission the legacy platforms. We also released the first capabilities of TruValidate integrated fraud suite for general availability. The suite produces notable predictive uplift and allows us to deliver our fraud point solutions to customers via a common API. In the third quarter, we signed our first contract for the integrated suite in a competitive win against top fraud vendors. TruIQ Data Enrichment provides instant access to TransUnion credit from within a customer's technology environment. This privacy first approach enables our customers to develop highly targeted marketing campaigns, while retaining control of their sensitive IP. In August, we launched data enrichment on the Snowflake platform to high customer interest with strong new sales and a growing pipeline. We see significant opportunity to embed identity-centric solutions like data enrichment directly within cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake, enabling customers to access our data within the environments of their choice. In our TruAudience marketing solutions, we achieved another key milestone in integrating products and building capabilities. Earlier this year, we unified the underlying identity graphs of our solutions to deliver more accurate identity resolution. This quarter, we consolidated the product, so that customers can experience our identity products on a common and modern user interface with improved features and functionality. Over the next few quarters, we expect to release further enhancement as well as roll out the capability internationally. Finally, we're in the process of migrating our internal big data and analytics environment, which we call SHAPE onto OneTru. SHAPE is frequently the starting point for new product innovation and is also used for customer analytics work, including our innovation labs. And we've onboarded and trained approximately 400 of our data scientists onto OneTru and delivered 10 innovation labs utilizing the platform. We plan to onboard and train all 1,000 plus of our data scientists by the end of this year, allowing us to decommission the legacy SHAPE platform in early 2025. OneTru is accelerating our innovation and enabling new products that resonate with our clients. We've already built a pipeline approaching 50 million and growing from recently introduced OneTru-powered products. Now the early success of OneTru strengthens our conviction in our technology modernization strategy. In addition to delivering continued innovation, 2025 will focus on application development and customer migration. Let me discuss our key initiatives for the coming year. In core U.S. Credit, we aim to have end-to-end capabilities for both online and batch services on OneTru by early next year. We plan to start parallel runs and initial migrations of customers in the first quarter with continued migrations throughout 2025. In India Credit, we are similarly migrating all data and analytics work on the OneTru next year. This will enable us to launch our TruIQ analytics suite and innovation labs into the region. We anticipate strong demand in India for our next generation analytics solutions. We are also well underway in modernizing our consumer solutions technology, which underpins our credit education and identity protection offerings for our indirect channel partners. We plan to consolidate our offerings, including those acquired through Sontiq onto a single global platform. We also plan to launch a comprehensive new interface for our direct-to-consumer product in early 2025. Finally, given the positive early indications of OneTru strengthening our core credit applications, we are evaluating opportunities for further international bureau migrations. Remember that our announced program focused on the U.S. and India through 2025, but we view OneTru as our destination platform for all bureau applications. Next year, we plan to lay the groundwork in four other key markets for their eventual migration to OneTru. We remain on track to complete our transformation program in 2025 with full savings benefits expected in 2026. We continue to expect to incur $355 million to $375 million of one-time expenses to capture the benefits of our transformation programs, including $200 million in 2024. We now expect CapEx to be 8% of revenues in 2024 against a prior expectation of 9%, driven by more efficient spend throughout this year in addition to higher revenues. We continue to expect CapEx to be approximately 8% of revenues in 2025. We continue to expect to deliver roughly $200 million of free cash flow benefit by 2026, driven by $100 million to $140 million of operating expense savings as well as $70 million to $80 million of CapEx savings as we lower our CapEx requirements to a sustainable 6% of revenues. In 2024, we now expect to deliver $85 million of in-year operating expense savings ahead of our $65 million expectations at the start of the year and supporting almost 100 basis points of margin expansion in the year. The higher savings in 2024 have been largely driven by our people-related actions and expanded GCC network. The remaining $45 million of expected savings will be driven primarily by our technology modernization. We expect to complete the investment program in 2025 and most of the technology cost rationalization will be actioned late in 2025 near the completion of the program. That means that the remaining savings will not be realized until 2026. Taken together, our transformation programs are driving tangible benefits across the organization and will enable us to reach new levels of performance and scale. We look forward to updating you on our accelerating innovation as well as progress against our remaining cost savings targets. Now, Todd will provide further details on our third quarter financial results and our updated full-year 2024 outlook. Todd? Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up, we exceeded third quarter expectations driven primarily by U.S. financial services and international. We're executing well against our transformation program, driving material savings and a step change improvement in innovation with several new capability and product launches powered by OneTru. We're raising our 2024 guidance and expect to deliver strong high-single-digit revenue growth and mid-teens adjusted diluted earnings per share growth for the year. Now let me turn it back to Greg. Okay. Well, good morning, Faiza. Thank you for the question and welcome everybody to the Q3 call. OneTru is having a very profound impact on our business and our ability to compete in a variety of product lines and markets. I think what's been most exciting is completing the integration phase of the acquisitions and the tech transformation that we've been doing and pivoting really to strong innovation. Over the past couple of quarters in earnings and in press releases, you've seen us announce a whole series of product innovations in analytics, in marketing solutions, in fraud, in credit for short-term unsecured lending. And I think the market should get used to this elevated pace of innovation, which is going to buttress our revenue growth and our revenue forecasts as we roll into next year. Recently, you may have seen an announcement of the next gen of our TruAudience marketing solutions, we've brought together the best of Neustar and the best of TransUnion marketing solutions for identity resolution and market segmentation and audience generation and onboarding with a new user interface onto the OneTru platform. And over the course of '25, we have quarterly robust product functional improvements in the pipeline. The story is the same on the fraud side. We've launched TruValidate, which is our brand name for our global fraud solutions. And again, we've integrated our various very strong point solutions for e-commerce fraud mitigation and just transaction authentication onto a common platform. Our predictive models are far more performant. We are winning new clients. And so we pointed to kind of a cumulative $50 million bookings benefit at this point that is driven directly from that innovation. I can say that over the last couple of quarters, our sales of marketing products have improved materially. And again, that's against a pretty tepid advertising and marketing environment as CMOs have had the belt tighten in a more difficult revenue environment and just a less aggressive posture toward client acquisition. I think as rates come down in 2025 and we achieve this soft landing and if economic macro conditions continue to be stable as they are or even improving, you could see consumer -- or rather our customers pivot more toward acquisition, which again would benefit. So I mean, I think before I say it's additive since we haven't guided to 2025, I just think it certainly derisks our belief that we can return to steady high-single-digit revenue compounding over the intermediate term. And that's really the goal. And look, the good news is we are guiding to that type of growth in 2024 with this raise. And we've yet to see any real strengthening in our end markets. We've just gone from a negative volume environment over the past 18 months to 24 months to one where we have stable, but still muted market conditions and we're demonstrating how growthful we can be given all of our products, given our geographic spread and the stability that we're now enjoying. Okay, Jeff, I'll take the India question. And I'm going to take your question about the diversification component as applying to India and not to the U.S. markets. Correct me if you... Yes. So as we pointed out in -- I think the last call, the RBI has become concerned over the pace of lending growth across the Indian marketplace and has taken certain actions to lower the loan-to-deposit ratio in that market. We view it as a prudent step to ensure kind of the stability and the soundness of lending practices within India, which year-on-year had been growing very rapidly. And I think the RBI is going to kind of maintain that for the coming quarters until they're comfortable that there's real integrity across all the lending practices, particularly unsecured lending, which they've scrutinized more highly. I think it's important to remember that India is an amazing market for all the reasons that we've talked about in prior calls, population growth, economic growth, penetration of financial products, and general innovation. And India wants to create a world-class financial services marketplace. And I think the actions by the RBI are toward that end. The lending market continues to be very strong. Delinquencies are at three-year lows. So there's not really a specific problem. And if you look at some of the recent actions against specific lenders, they were more concerned that the appropriate interest rates were being charged to consumers, not an excess interest rate. So it had the flavor of anti-usury if you will, and also that banks were properly diligencing the affordability of loans for consumers. So really, we just view it as a prudent and conservative posture by the RBI to ensure that they don't suffer a boom and then bust cycle. I think we got to remember that we're accelerating our growth outside of core consumer lending, while we're also expanding the number of use cases within consumer lending that we can serve, particularly agri lending and other small-dollar lending, micro lending, if you will, and increasing the analytic products that we're bringing to consumer lending. But the team is confident that we can continue to produce this outsized growth for the intermediate future because of the diversification in commercial, in direct-to-consumer, in fraud, and marketing solutions as we bring them and just a whole array of new analytic products that we can bring across the Indian marketplace. So while growth has slowed from the low-30s to the low-20s, we still expect this market to compound over the next three, five years at very attractive rates and we'll guide more to that effect in the early part of next year. Yes. So emerging verticals in the U.S. grew 3% in the third quarter. It's down a touch from the 4% growth rate we achieved in the first couple of quarters, we don't really view it as a concern. We think things will accelerate and we'll be back mid-single-digits for the fourth quarter and for the full-year. I mean, on a quarterly basis, there's always some lumpiness or noise. In the third quarter for emerging public sector, which is a lumpy business, grew, but not as fast as it typically does and will for the full year. We were also lapping some very large comps in media. You may recall next year; we had a big media quarter in the third quarter of '23 and so there was a difficult comp there. The good news is that insurance is returning to its former growthfulness, and we saw some double-digit growth, low-double-digit growth in the -- in the third quarter, technology, retail and e-commerce, solid, tenant and employment screening, et cetera, still looking good. So our prospects are improving, and momentum is improving in emerging verticals. And again, we saw a lot of marketing and fraud solutions into emerging, and I feel like we're pretty well positioned to deliver a good year of growth and continue into next year. Yes. Thank you, Kelsey. So I've been in the business for 11-years now, and for 10 of them, we've had outsized growth rates in Canada and that team has done a great job of consistently gaining market share. The playbook has been consistent innovation. They have done a great job of innovating in country, but also importing just a range of relevant product innovations from the U.S. and adapting it to the Canadian market. We were also the first mover in launching trended data in the Canadian market and we've got a very rich trended dataset, many attributes that perform extremely well vis-a-vis our competition and we've been able just to bring down shingles year-after-year in Canada. And I expect that the team will continue to do so. Now we're starting to lap some very large growth rates in a mature market. And so the rate of growth is going to decelerate from the mid and sometimes high teens that we've enjoyed over these last few quarters. But the Canadian team knows what they're doing. They're going to continue to innovate, they're going to continue to focus on ways to make Canadian lenders more effective and more profitable. And I think we're going to do quite well going forward. Yes, thanks for the question, Jason. Direct-to-consumer in the consumer business overall remains an area of intense focus for innovation, and we've talked a lot about it in recent quarters. I feel like we're still on the path to deliver what we need to strategically to return this business to growth. Now, look, in any one quarter you're going to have some noise, but it's important to understand that on the direct-to-consumer side, we are broadening the value proposition and improving our go-to-market strategy, so that we can better monetize the audience that we're getting: one, just our natural flow given our brand in the U.S., but also through our marketing efforts, which we've continued to fine tune to be both effective and entirely compliant. When I talk about broadening the value proposition, I mean, obviously, we've got to bring all things credit to the consumer. We've got to have education and access and simulation and we're good at that. But we've been able to bring identity protection and breach remediation services. And I believe in the relatively near future, we will also launch offers capability, which has been a missing link to the component and we're very excited about bringing that capability to the U.S. markets and beyond and enabling our indirect business to bring the full complement of consumer solutions, which again is credit, identity protection, breach mitigation and a financial and insurance offers engine, right? So that's kind of the strategy and we are making great progress in delivering that. And in fact, that will probably become a focal point of an upcoming earnings call. So that's what I would say about consumer. Yes. Well, thanks for the question, Manav. There is a bit of a revenue element, but it's secondary. The core is that we're actually achieving the technology transformation with a lower level of spend. Now when we announced in the early fourth quarter of last year, this current chapter of the transformation, which is really the two components of an operating model shift, we're relocating more work to the GCCs, but also an acceleration of technology investment on the backs of Project Rise to consolidate applications on the platform. We're just getting that done with a lower level of spend this year. And so we've reduced guidance on our CapEx to 8% from 9%, but it really has to do from effectiveness. Now some of these other areas that you mentioned, they are important areas of investment. We're continuing to invest disproportionately in innovation, but not all of it is capitalized, right? So the component that is capitalizable, we're getting the work done with less, and so I think it's good news. Yes. And the other wrinkle on that is, given that we are actually consolidating on a global platform and not just migrating the same stuff to the cloud, we will have fewer systems to care and feed for and we can concentrate our engineering on a common configurable global platform. And I think that's really going to be a point of leverage in our earnings and our innovation going forward. Yes. Thank you for the question. So look my perspective is that each of the bureaus provide great data and analytics and serve our customers well and that there is a good competitive intensity and a lot of innovation. I mean, if you look over the decade that I've been here, lots of innovation. Each of the three of us have differentiated value propositions and I think you know what those are. I don't necessarily view this as a zero some type competition. I view it as -- each of the bureaus expanding the range of services and the value they can add to clients to gain share of spending, to gain wallet share, if you will. And I think we'll each pursue our somewhat differentiated strategies to accomplish that. But net-net, this is an expanding market. There's a lot of work that clients do internally that I think the bureaus are well positioned to take over and incorporate into their value propositions. And then I also think that it's just data and analytics is hugely important to lenders, insurers, and the entire client base operating effectively. And so they're willing to pay premiums for quality data and insights that help them manage their broader P&Ls more effectively. So I think that's why it's a great business. There's a constant stream of innovation, we can prove the value that we add, and I think TransUnion is certainly well positioned to grow with and above the market across the geographies that we compete in."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Bardi, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nGreg Bardi : Good morning and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning. And they can also be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses, and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures, along with the corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. Today's call will be recorded and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. With that, let me turn it over to Chris.\nChris Cartwright : Thank you, Greg. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll provide the financial highlights for our second quarter 2024 results. Second, I'll discuss OneTru and how we're modernizing our technology and product platforms. Finally, Todd will detail our second quarter results, along with our third quarter and full year 2024 guidance. Now, in the second quarter, TransUnion exceeded guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. Given the strength in the quarter and recent large breach remediation wins, we're raising our full year 2024 guidance, which Todd will detail later. We expect a strong year for both revenue and earnings growth. With that said, we are maintaining our conservative guidance posture due to ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Revenue grew 8% on an organic constant currency basis, above our 5% to 6% guidance. Our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage, of 4% also exceeded our expectations. In the U.S., we experienced muted, but stable lending volumes that were consistent with the first quarter and well below historical trends. Consumer finances in the U.S. remain broadly healthy due to continued low unemployment and some real wage growth, but pressures on lower income consumers have led to waning spending activity. Inflation slowed in the quarter after a modest tick-up at the start of the year, and market expectations are for the Fed to start lowering interest rates later in the year. Consumer delinquencies rose slightly for mortgages and auto loans, but have begun to stabilize for credit cards and personal loans. Our U.S. market segments grew 6%. Financial services was up 11%, led by 50% plus growth in mortgage. Emerging verticals grew 4%, driven by strength across insurance, public sector, tech, retail, and e-commerce, and media. Within U.S. markets, NeuStar also delivered another solid quarter. Trusted Call Solutions continues to lead the way, growing more than 40% with positive contribution across our verticals. NeuStar delivered mid-single digit growth in the first two quarters of the year and remains on track for mid-single digit growth in 2024. Consumer Interactive declined 1%, as expected, and we believe we're closer to an inflection point to return Consumer Interactive to sustainable growth, supported by strong identity protection and breach wins, and progress in stabilizing our consumer direct offering. Our international segment grew by 14% on a constant currency basis. The 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 27% growth, while Asia Pacific, Latin America, Canada, and Africa all grew double digits. And finally, we prepaid $80 million in debt during the quarter and intend to make further prepayments in the second half of the year. We also completed a debt refinancing to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest expense. We made strong progress with our technology modernization in the second quarter. Slide 5 illustrates how we're aligning TransUnion around a new global technology platform and solutions. By consolidating our powerful yet independent products into integrated suites on a next generation technology foundation, we believe that we can accelerate innovation, reduce cost, and leverage our solutions across our regions to drive revenue. Now to orient you on this visual from the bottom up, OneDev is the internal name for our new technology infrastructure operating system. OneDev standardizes our infrastructure services and developer tools in a single foundation to reduce cost and increase engineering productivity. In fact, it's the primary driver of our technology modernization savings. Built off of OneDev, OneTru is our core solutions enablement platform, which centralizes our common product services of data management, identity resolution, analytics, and delivery. OneTru is a key driver of innovation and revenue growth. And leveraging OneTru, our solutions are being integrated into end-to-end product suites under single brands, such as TruValidate fraud prevention and TruAudience marketing solutions. These integrated suites deliver dramatically better performance within clear global brand families. I'll now further explain how each technology layer creates value across the enterprise and share some examples of the benefits we've already delivered in our TruValidate fraud suite and Factor Trust alternative lending product. Now OneDev builds upon the success of Project Rise to create a global technology foundation common across our applications, reducing complexity, saving costs, and freeing engineering resources for innovation. OneDev creates a single technology operating plane that is cloud agnostic, preventing supplier lock-in. It also standardizes our developer utilities, creating a one-trans-union way for managing security, compliance, capacity provisioning, and software deployment. In addition to improving our developer productivity, OneDev will help us rationalize third-party software and other legacy technology costs. We will continue to operate our own private cloud infrastructure for certain applications where the economics are more attractive. OneDev provides the foundation for OneTru, which is our central data management, identity, and analytics hub. The platform standardizes the process of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence and deploying it within our product suites. This also allows our product specialists to focus on the data and analytic customization and workflow functionality needed to create innovative products. Let me detail the key processes that OneTru standardizes. OneTru integrates our data assets in credit risk, marketing, and fraud prevention into a unified data management environment. We embed strong permission and compliance controls to separate our credit and non-credit data. Our data scientists have easy access to our full complement of proprietary and public data for rapid, cross-functional development of insights. OneTru identity graphs link our offline and online data together for a consistent view of consumer identity, helping customers to reliably resolve identities across product lines and use cases. By servicing clients across risk, marketing, and fraud services, we participate in a broad feedback loop that reinforces our identity capabilities. OneTru Analytics Services consolidates and standardizes our tools and models in a single interface for use by our internal teams and customers alike. As new capabilities emerge, such as artificial intelligence or machine learning as a service, we can deploy these capabilities rapidly and at scale. And finally, OneTru's delivery layer leverages consistent and configurable technology for seamless delivery of our data and intelligence to customers for easier product upgrades and cross-selling. Now, I want to reinforce that OneTru already powers Heritage NeuStar marketing and fraud products, as well as our new enterprise identity graphs, our innovation labs, and our internal analytics environments. We're also launching a number of new products on OneTru this quarter, including TruValidate Fraud Prevention, TruAudience Marketing, and a number of enhancements to our advanced acquisition suite. We plan to continue this rapid pace of innovation and modernization over the next 18 months as we further refine and scale this platform. Now, TransUnion products will be integrated into broader functional suites built upon the world-class capabilities of the OneTru platform and then taken to market using the Tru portfolio brands. Over the last few years, we've organized our broad range of B2B products and our multitude of brands into several global product families. These global brand families clarify our offerings, they demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities, and make it easier for customers to find what they need. We continue to leverage our core competency in consumer identity to expand further beyond credit and risk into marketing and fraud prevention use cases. And we'll measure the success of our technology and product platform strategy in terms of driving better growth across credit, fraud, and marketing, as well as delivering on our cost savings targets. In the interim, we are tracking progress toward improving our product quality, our time to market, and the pace of innovation. So let me briefly spotlight the benefits that we're already seeing with TruValidate and FactorTrust. Our integrated TruValidate suite, powered by OneTru, combines our comprehensive identity data along with fraud signals from a range of NeuStar and TransUnion products. We aggregate the signal in our single platform where we apply advanced analytics to extract deep insights. The predictive uplift from consolidating all of our fraud signals and analytics onto OneTru has been notable. When we compare OneTru to our current in-market offerings, we see a 30% plus increase in fraud detection, along with a 75% decrease in false positives. This enhancement enables customers to better protect themselves while providing a friction-right experience for consumers. Now we're nearing the end of our beta testing for our first release with select customers. The initial results are extremely positive. We expect the first general release to be available later this quarter. Our fraud product suite serves thousands of customers today around the world and represents roughly $300 million in revenues last year against a multi-billion dollar addressable market. We aspire to be the customer's first call for fraud mitigation, and we see a substantial opportunity to gain market share with our integrated suite, which we know performs much better than the patchwork of point solutions so many customers use today. We're also in the process of modernizing FactorTrust, our short-term lending bureau within our TruVision suite, to OneTru over the course of 2024. The FactorTrust modernization serves as proof of concept of how OneTru can enhance our credit bureau capabilities across batch, online, and analytics. We're already taking foundational steps to migrate our core U.S. and Indian credit bureaus to OneTru starting early in 2025. OneTru is improving the speed and efficacy of FactorTrust, which we believe will strengthen our competitive positioning in the short-term lending space. We're seeing substantial improvement in the speed of batch processing from 24 hours to one hour, allowing faster on-demand retrospective analyses. Additionally, OneTru's modern delivery layer allows us to deliver enhanced data attributes and model upgrades seamlessly with improved model deployment, self-service analytics, and batch capabilities. We see opportunity for a near-term upgrade cycle, followed by more frequent and ongoing upgrades, strengthening our position for more competitive wins in the future. We look forward to continuing to update you on how OneTru platform is driving innovation across our product lines over the next several quarters. And now I'll hand it to Todd to provide further details on our second quarter financial results and our updated full year 2024 outlook. Todd?\nTodd Cello : Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. Mortgage drove roughly half of our $15 million of revenue outperformance. The other half of outperformance was broad-based, principally in emerging verticals and international. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign currency. Our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% at the high end of our expectations and up 115 basis points compared to the year ago quarter due to flow-through on revenue growth and realization of transformation cost savings. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99, an increase of 15%. Adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%. Finally, in the second quarter, we took $33 million of one-time charges related to the next phase of our transformation program, $15 million for operating model optimization, and $18 million for technology transformation. We incurred $76 million of one-time transformation expenses in the first half of the year and expect to incur approximately $200 million throughout 2024, driving at least $65 million of in-year operating expense savings. As part of our $355 million to $375 million program, we expect the remaining $75 million to $95 million of one-time expenses to be incurred in 2025. Looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. markets revenue, which includes Consumer Interactive, was up 6% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points to 39%. Our U.S. market segment benefited from a sequential increase in realized transformation cost savings. Financial services revenue grew 11%. Excluding mortgage, financial services revenue was down 2%. Trends were consistent with the levels seen in the first quarter. We continue to outperform softer volume activity driven by new business wins and successful cross-sell, including with NeuStar Solutions. In the third and fourth quarter, we expect improving financial services ex mortgage growth rates as comparisons ease in the back half of the year. Our credit card and banking business was down 2%. Activity remains tempered as lenders balance improving deposit basis and stabilizing delinquency rates against mixed consumer confidence. We are enabling our customers to navigate the current environment and position themselves for future growth with highly relevant products such as Trusted Call solutions, TruIQ's analytical suite, and our marketing solutions. Consumer lending revenue declined 3%. Fintech online activity remains muted but stable with a modest uptick in batch marketing. The short-term lending space remains soft. We continue to see wallet and new logo wins across both fintech and short-term lending as well as expanding new customer use cases. Our Auto business grew 3% despite continued headwinds in the auto market driven by our innovative credit solutions and new wins in Trusted Call Solutions. New vehicle sales continue to grow modestly but there remain affordability challenges across the market from higher interest rates in still high used car prices. We expect similar trends to persist throughout the year. For mortgage, revenue grew 53% against inquiry volume declines of 11%, modestly better than our expectations. We saw good prequalification volume supported by healthy shopping activity while mortgage originations remain down and significantly below historical averages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 9% of total TransUnion revenue. Emerging verticals grew 4% in the quarter led by insurance, public sector, tech retail and e-commerce, and media, offsetting modest declines in telco and tenant employment. Insurance grew 6% as market trends progress as anticipated which we expect to support growth acceleration in the second half of the year. Insurers are gradually increasing marketing activity as rate adequacy improves, driving demand for our credit-based marketing solutions as well as our suite of identity-based data hygiene, audience and analytic solutions. Consumer shopping activity remains strong. We continue to have a robust new business pipeline, particularly across our TruVision Driving History suite as well as cross-sell of Neustar and Sontiq Solutions. Public sector grew double digits with strength across credit, communications and fraud solutions as well as favorable project timing. Media and tech retail and e-commerce both grew mid-single digit. The overall marketing backdrop remains muted but stable and we delivered good growth in Trusted Call Solutions and our risk products. Elections grew modestly while telco and tenant and employment declined low single digit. Tenant employment year-over-year declines dissipated and we expect growth in the second half of the year as we lap the impact of our product recalibration and ramp recent new business wins. Turning to Consumer Interactive, revenue decreased 1%. Our indirect channel grew, benefited from continued breach wins. Our direct business declined as expected as we work through the impact of our recalibrated marketing strategy. For my comments about international, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 14% with five of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% up 120 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 27% on top of 35% growth in the prior year second quarter. We grew strongly in consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct to consumer, supported by healthy market trends. Our UK business returned to growth up 4% in the quarter. UK market continues to stabilize with improving inflation figures and expectations for lower interest rates, supporting gradually improving banking and fintech activity. Additionally, our consumer offerings as well as our insurance and gaming verticals drove strong performance. In Canada, we again delivered strong performance, growing 12% against flattish market volumes. Growth was broad based, benefiting from share gains and batch sales and financial services, strengthened insurance, and recent consumer indirect and breach wins. Into the second half of the year, we anticipate some deceleration in our growth rate in Canada as we lap sizable new business wins, but expect to deliver healthy and market leading performance. In Latin America, revenue growth accelerated to 13% with broad-based growth across regions. Colombia grew double digits, and we're starting to see the improving fintech growth after a period of retrenchment. Brazil also accelerated to double-digit growth driven by improving new business win momentum. In Asia Pacific, we grew 14%, led by very strong growth in the Philippines and another solid quarter in Hong Kong. Finally, Africa increased 10% with broad-based growth led by our retail vertical. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.2 billion of debt and $543 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.3 times. We made an $80 million debt prepayment in the second quarter and expect to make further prepayments over the course of 2024 with excess free cash flow after funding our transformation initiatives. Remember that we expect roughly $280 million of accrued onetime transformation expenses from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the end of 2024, with the majority paid out this year. In the quarter, we also successfully completed debt refinancing to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest expense. We refinanced $1.5 billion of our $2.2 billion Term Loan B5 into Term Loan B8 as well as our entire Term Loan A and revolving credit facility. We extended the maturity of the portion of our Term Loan B5 from 2026 to 2031 and our Term Loan A and revolving credit facility from 2028 to 2029. Additionally, we successfully removed the credit spread adjustment for the portion of our Term Loan B5, Term Loan A and revolving credit facility. Since announcing our Neustar acquisition, we have voluntarily prepaid $1.6 billion while executing on three refinancing transactions to lower our interest expense and extend our maturity profile. Net of our swaps, our all-in average effective cost of debt at today's rates is roughly 4.9% below the current SOFR rate. You can find two slides on our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. Based on our expectation for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low three times range by the end of 2024. We continue to work towards our leverage ratio target of under three times. We do not view 3 times as an ending point for deleveraging and view debt prepayment as an attractive use of cash. Turning to guidance. We are pleased with our outperformance over the first six months of the year, but our approach remains unchanged. We continue to assume muted economic growth throughout 2024 with steady lending volumes and no benefit from interest rate cuts. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We expect foreign exchange to have a less than 0.5% impact on revenue and insignificant impact on adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to be between $1.044 billion and $1.06 billion or up 8% to 10% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately two points of tailwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 6% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Included in our guidance is a roughly 4.5% benefit from recent large breach remediation wins that we expect will be realized in the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $367 million and $380 million, up 3% to 7%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.2% to 35.8% or down 90 to 160 basis points. A few nuances on third quarter margin. The impact of our lower margin large breach wins is a roughly 80 basis points drag on quarterly margins. Additionally, the impact of normalizing incentive compensation when compared to last third quarter's low levels when we had a reversal of variable compensation accrual is a little over 100 basis points drag. Excluding those items, we expect to deliver strong underlying margin expansion, benefiting from revenue growth and the realization of our transformation savings. We also expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.97 and $1.02, up 6% to 12%. Turning to the full year. We now expect revenue to come in between $4.098 billion and $4.138 billion or up 7% to 8% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. We expect our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage to be up about 4% to 5%. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or up low-single digit, excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up low double digit or low-single digit growth, excluding mortgage. We expect mortgage revenue to increase about 50% based on mortgage inquiries being down over 5%. We expect inquiries to be down roughly 5% in the second half of the year. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digit. We now expect Consumer Interactive to increase low-single digit, an increase from down low-single digit due to the breach wins. We continue to expect international to grow low-double digit. Turning back to the total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.455 billion and $1.485 billion, up 8% to 11%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.5% to 35.9% or up 40 to 80 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.78 to $3.90, up 12% to 16%. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million. We expect the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, to be about $245 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $250 million for the full year. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue. We continue to expect to incur approximately $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. Before wrapping up, I want to summarize the drivers of our guidance raise from what we guided in April. The increase in our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by two factors, first is our outperformance in the second quarter as we exceeded the high end of our revenue expectations by $15 million and adjusted EBITDA by $5 million; second, we expect our large breach wins to contribute roughly $40 million of revenue and $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year, with the vast majority recognized in the third quarter. The margin profile of breaches can vary depending on the services offered. With the acquisition of Sontiq, we are now able to play a meaningful role in the breach market with end-to-end services to meet the needs of a particular event. The large breach wins we are servicing now utilize all of our services, including print notification, which collectively are lower margin. By comparison, the numerous small breaches we continue to win typically utilize the higher-margin services. These large breach wins build our momentum, credibility and relevance in the growing space. Importantly, excluding the breach benefit, our expectations for the second half of the year are unchanged from April as we maintain our prudent guidance approach. We continue to expect healthy revenue growth and strong underlying margin expansion in the back half of the year. We are pleased with the progress on our transformation programs and remain well on track to deliver at least $65 million of savings throughout 2024. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments.\nChris Cartwright : Thanks, Todd. And to wrap up, we exceeded second quarter expectations driven by mortgage growth and broad-based outperformance in emerging verticals in International. We achieved key milestones against our transformation and technology modernization programs reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitments. And we're raising our 2024 guidance behind the strong second quarter results and our recent breach wins. We remain focused and confident in delivering strong results in the current low growth market environment. Now let me turn it back over to Greg.\nGreg Bardi: That concludes our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, we ask that you each ask only one question so that we can include more participants. Operator, we can begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler : Yeah, thank you. Good morning. So I want to ask about card and banking and consumer lending, I guess, both in the quarter and going forward from the standpoint that it sounds like market conditions are stable, but your numbers got a little bit worse in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So what drove that? And then going forward, I hear you on the benefit from the easier comp, but at what point do we see greater, I guess, underlying improvement beyond the using comp benefit, especially now that DQs are starting to level off given that they're further along in the normalization process. Thank you.\nTodd Cello : Hey, good morning, Jeff. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. So as it pertains to financial -- let's talk about financial services just in total, excluding mortgage. I know your question is about card and banking and consumer lending. But in the first quarter, we did grow 1%, and we just reported a decline of 2% in the second quarter. What we think is a more instructive way to look at it is to look at what actually happened in the first half of the year. And when you look at it on that basis, everything was pretty much flat. What we see there is simply a continuation of the trends that we saw exiting 2023. Needless to say, in Q3 of 2023, we saw a step down. And we've been pleased with what we characterized in our prepared remarks as a stabilization in our volumes. So when you look at the second half of the year, to your point, the volumes comparisons will definitely get easier where we're expecting in the third quarter, a low-single digit growth rate for financial services ex mortgage. But when you get into the fourth quarter because remember, the step down that we saw in 2023 was started really in September. So you saw the full run rate of that happen in the fourth quarter of 2023. So the comparable there look is about a mid-single digit grower in the fourth quarter that we're expecting. A lot of the focus, and rightfully so, is on how our volumes are performing, but it is also important to note that we do continue to win meaningful new logos, new business, as well as we've been successful within financial services and cross-selling Neustar capabilities. So the point in that is it's important to look at this a little bit more broader than just the volumes because there are other places that we have had some success.\nChris Cartwright : Yeah. I would just reinforce a couple of points. I mean we view this as stable market conditions, even though technically, we are a bit negative in the two categories that you pointed out. I mean, naturally, you are going to expect some variations in and around the floor. And so we think these fluctuations are within a stable, but muted, lending environment. I think the more important takeaway is that we are demonstrating that, through our diversification and overall business model strength, we can grow even when the conditions are muted. And so we've got nice top-line growth, good fall-through margin improvement and the ability to delever despite the fact that we're still in kind of a stable -- I mean, kind of a stable, but depressed, market conditions. Now looking forward, when do we think we're going to actually start to see growth beyond just steady conditions against easing comps? Look, it's tough to predict, but the consumers are holding up pretty well because they're employed and they're enjoying some real wage growth. There has been increasing distress among sub-prime and lower-income consumers, but we think some of that is moderating. And as you point out, delinquencies are easing. The deposit bases within the banks are stabilizing. And I think that means we're getting closer to market conditions, where marketing activity and the customer acquisition is going to improve. Of course, if the Fed does come through with any rate reductions in the second half of the year, that would be additive to our forecast at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Steinerman : Hi. Glad to hear that Neustar's revenue growth was solid in the quarter and on track for the year. Could you just give some more color on what's driving Neustar's revenues within the marketing and fraud solutions? And how is joint product development going traction in joint product development products that have been introduced? And lastly, is Neustar still expecting to have EBITDA margins around 32% this year?\nChris Cartwright : Well, first, quickly on the margin question because that's probably faster to address. Yes, 32% is our guide for the year. And we do believe that there's upside to those margins as we complete the realization of the acquisition synergies as we complete the technology modernization that we outlined in the third, fourth quarter environment last year. And also, as we return to more normalized marketing conditions, marketing has been in retreat for about 12 months plus now and our marketing products tend to be higher margin than the communication products because there's a lower cost of goods sold associated with them. So we also have some mix headwinds that are keeping Neustar margins a little bit lower than we expect in more normalized conditions. Now if you look across the board, we're having a pretty good year in fraud with Neustar, we're having a softer year in marketing relative to our guidance, and it's because of the pressures on businesses to find efficiencies in marketing in a more difficult environment. And we're doing pretty well on communication solutions, in particular, the subcomponent of communications, which is Trusted Call Solutions where we're getting really outsized growth because we've got a product that's getting great market acceptance, and we're going to continue to ride that. On the innovation front, we are very close to launching the next generation of our integrated marketing products, a unified marketing solution that combines the best of heritage TransUnion and Neustar on a single integrated platform. And that's one of the reasons why we took the time in this earnings call to focus on the many components of OneTru in the tech transformation because this next-generation solution is built upon OneTru. And also on OneDev, the underlying foundation. And it's going to bring together all of the data, the marketing audience data, all of the identity data and resolution capabilities in the range of identity, hygiene, audience planning, activation and media measurement services in a single integrated system. So we expect that to launch late third quarter. And rolling into next year, we think we're going to see material acceleration in growth there regardless of market conditions. We're also excited because we've achieved the same kind of product innovation milestone in the fraud world. We are launching the next-generation TruValidate fraud solution. We highlighted it in my section of the earnings. You can see it performs dramatically better. And it's been a point of integration and consolidation of the various fraud solutions that we have either acquired or built in different geographies through the year on the common Neustar platform. And by aggregating all of that signal and bringing advanced analytics against it, we're able to identify fraud far more effectively, but also reduce false positives, which saves our customers a lot of needless labor. So I'd say in the broad, Andrew, we're kind of moving from the acquisition integration phase, and we're kind of deeply now in the acquisition innovation phase.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy : Yes, hi. Thank you so much. So wanted to talk more about emerging verticals beyond Neustar? You've done well in the first half, you highlighted 4% growth, but you're still keeping the low-single digit growth outlook for the year. So just curious on some puts and takes there and how we should be thinking about the back half?\nTodd Cello : Good morning, Faiza. I'll take that question. Yes, we are pleased with the performance that we've had thus far with the emerging verticals, in particular, growing 4% in the latest quarter, but there are several moving pieces that I do feel are important to walk through. In our prepared remarks, we did speak about some good growth that we are seeing in insurance. The insurance vertical grew 6% in the quarter. As we think forward about that business, marketing continues on the recovery, which is a positive thing for the industry overall as rate adequacy has improved. And we're also seeing some strong shopping activity by consumers. So we expect that to continue on. Within the Emerging Verticals, it almost like I would think about segmenting where the growth came from. So insurance is clearly the standout because of its size and the growth that we're seeing, but also in the quarter, we saw good growth in public sector, which was a double-digit grower, broad-based, but the public sector business does have some project work in it, so that can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, but nevertheless, was a meaningful contributor to the growth rate. Also, our tech retail and e-commerce and our media vertical grew greater than the 4% for Emerging Verticals overall, which we view as a very solid result because much of the marketing revenue that we just spoke about from Neustar and the joint capabilities that TransUnion has created, they reside in these two verticals. So when you look at insurance, public sector, tech retail, e-commerce, media that's where the vast majority of the growth is coming from. Offsetting that, we are seeing our collections business still growing, but lower than the overall growth rate for Emerging Verticals. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the tenant and employment business declined, but we expect that those declines have dissipated. We know they have, and we're going to see this business return back to growth with our recalibrated product offering. And then finally, something I always keep in mind, Chris just talked about our communications product suite, which TCS is part of, but our communications vertical houses many of the legacy Neustar products that are slow -- flattish to slow or declining growth and they're going to be a drag. So the net-net is you see some good growth from the vast majority of these verticals and then there are some offsets that are there. Thinking about this just relative to our guide for the second half of the year. As we said, we didn't change the guide. So with that being said, I think that we look at this and say that the risk in the Emerging Verticals skews more to the upside than to the downside for all the reasons that I just went through for each of the Emerging Verticals.\nChris Cartwright : Yeah. And I think that's just kind of an important point philosophically to emphasize really to all of the analysts and investors on the call is that we're maintaining our guidance posture of beat and hold as opposed to beat and raise, right? And so we're letting the beats flow through, but we're maintaining the same conservative expectations in the future quarters in the second half of the year that we did at the outset of the year. And we think that's more prudent given the gyrations in the macro market over the past couple of years and some of the difficulty in forecasting the business. And we feel like we're well positioned to deliver against the guidance that we're reinforcing in this call.\nOperator: And our next question will be from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nToni Kaplan : Thanks so much. I think this was touched on a little bit, but just wanted to really nail it down. You mentioned that you didn't change sort of your guidance expectation. So I definitely appreciate that. But backing out the breach wins, your 3Q organic growth guide implies a bit of a deceleration in organic growth. And so maybe just talk about what the slowdown implied would be from? And maybe it's just conservatism, but are there specific headwinds to call out or really, is it just you wanting to really be able to show good numbers and be conservative? Thanks.\nTodd Cello : Toni, I'm glad you asked the question because it's an important point. And it really just kind of reinforces the point that Chris just made in that when you look at the -- our performance, and let's do this for TransUnion in total, excluding mortgage. In the first quarter, we grew 5%. Second quarter, we grew 4% and now the growth rate at the high end, we're saying excluding the breach, because the breach wins that we've had a onetime nature, we'd be at about 3.5% in the third quarter. And then you can do the math and the implied is going to be about 3% for the fourth quarter. So clearly a step down from what we've seen. But just simply put, as Chris just said, we just feel it's the prudent thing right now to not get in a situation where we're raising expectations because the business in core financial services, I answered previously, it continues to be stable. We haven't seen that uptick yet happen. So as a result, we think what's best is for us to stick with the numbers that we put out going back to February for the second half of the year because things do still remain uncertain for us. So that second half guide is unchanged. And again, reinforcing no assumption of a lending recovery or any type of marketing recovery, benefit from a Fed rate cut. And I'll just leave you with Q1 and Q2. We guided 2% to 3%, and we were fortunate to be able to outperform that. And I can tell you that, that is what the team is working towards to do that in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Zhu : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So on breach revenues, I think you mentioned large breach wins in the quarter. I was wondering if you can give us a little bit more details on that. I think breach revenues are generally hard to forecast and can be lumpy. So what's the sustainable level of growth in your view? And then on top of that, if you could tell us a little bit more about the competitive landscape there, that would be great because Experian also highlights that there's strong growth there.\nChris Cartwright : Yeah, Kelsey. Well, breach is a large and growing market. And you only have to follow the news for a few weeks, and you're going to see major companies sustaining breaches. With the acquisition of Neustar -- I'm sorry, with the acquisition of Sontiq, and the investments that we've made, we feel like we have emerged as a significant player in breach now. And our brand is such that we are kind of in the deal flow, and we've got the broad set of capabilities to service small and large needs alike, reach needs that skew through the physical or the digital. We've got the comprehensive range of services and we're going to compete more effectively win share and have a higher sustainable level of breach revenues. Now that said, you are correct. These deals are episodic. Sometimes, you're going to have big ones, sometimes we may not have the big one in the quarter. And that's why we've taken pains to really call out this higher than usual level of breach wins in the third quarter. I think it's also important to understand that these breach wins come with attractive margins. They may not be quite as high as our enterprise margins in total, but they're not dramatically different, right? So I would hate for an analyst to look at what we're reporting in the third quarter and conclude that, that's the typical margin of the breach business. Third quarter financial performance really is just about the timing of revenue arrival against the expenses. And on these particular breaches, we're doing broad physical notification through the mail, and we're just paying a lot of postage. What it doesn't include is the much higher tail of revenue that's going to continue for the next year or two related to the digital services associated with these wins. So we look at the breaches on a deal-by-deal basis, they are attractive to margin, it's fast growing. And we think we're much better positioned to compete for them going forward.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik : Thank you. I just wanted to ask on that seven product suites that you showed. It sounds like you've grouped all the offerings into that. But is that internally, I suppose, is the leadership aligned by each of those? Or is it more by the segmentation you provide just wondering how interconnected these things are? Or are they really being separated into these seven product offerings or brands, rather?\nChris Cartwright : Yeah, Manav, I love the question. So let's talk about our global operating model. Certainly, we've got countries and we have vertical leadership within those countries that focus on the specific wants and the needs and the use cases for our products that are most relevant within those verticals. But we also have a parallel product organization, our solutions organization. And we have defined leadership and product management teams that align directly to the product families that you see. So if you were here, I could introduce you to our marketing lead, our fraud lead, our consumer lead, et cetera. And so it is much like a large global software company that's going to have a product leader overseeing a particular category of software or a consumer packaged goods company that's going to have a category manager. But then they are interfacing with the folks that lead the go-to-market in the countries or the specific verticals.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeather Balsky : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on Consumer Interactive outside the breach. You talked about nearing an inflection in that business. I'm curious if you can talk a little bit more about that, what you're seeing and what gives you confidence in the business accelerating.\nChris Cartwright : Yeah. Good question, Heather. So we talked a lot about a consumer in recent calls and the three portions of consumer. And that the most challenged one has been the direct-to-consumer subscription business that we have through transunion.com and other properties. And what we're seeing now is that the rate of decline is slowing and slowed in the second quarter. We expect it to slow further in the third and reach kind of an equilibrium point or kind of low-single digit declines by the fourth quarter of this year. And that will really reduce the drag on earnings from this piece of the business in the larger indirect piece where there has been really a mix of success for the freemium players and revenue pressure from the subscription players and just more kind of competition for share in that, we're seeing stabilization, and we're getting growth out of that segment. And then what's really helping our results the most is the multiyear mid-double digit compounding that we're getting out of Sontiq. So Sontiq grew 20% last year, it was a great year, driven in part by success in breach, but also in underlying identity subscription sales. And this year, we're positioning ourselves for another year of really strong growth. Now stepping back a bit, we still firmly believe that we're going to return the consumer business in total to consistent revenue growth, to consistent compounding. And we're going to pursue each of the monetization options to make that happen. So we're going to continue to do well on the subscription front. We're going to improve our capabilities in terms of offering supporting offers directly to consumers, both through our web properties, but also enabling other players to do so in the marketplace. And we're going to build upon the momentum in identity and breach remediation.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nShlomo Rosenbaum : Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Just I want to just -- one clarification thing and then to jump on to one other item. Just -- was there any unusual breach activity in the current quarter in the 2Q '24, just because the bottom of Slide 12 says on Consumer Interactive, indirect growth led by breach. I want to know if that is for some of the unusual activity you talked about that's heading in 3Q. Did any of it kind of pop into 2Q? And then the more important question is, Chris, where you guys stand in terms of the transformation project? Are you tracking in line, ahead? I'm not just talking about the costs, I'm talking about what you expect to get out of it, the timing of the project and your optimism about the success?\nChris Cartwright : Okay. Well, thanks for both of your questions there. And look, there was nothing unusual in the breach activity I mean the only, I guess, unusual or new thing is our ability to compete and win these big breach jobs. And we won several of them, and we're getting the benefit of that in the third quarter, but the second quarter, it's not really a factor.\nTodd Cello : Well, we have it on the slide, right? So that's what he's responding. That's what he's asking about. So we did have -- in our indirect channel, Shlomo, all we're doing is just characterizing where the growth is coming from in that channel and indirect, remember, it represents breach, but also our business with the premium players, the offer aggregators as well. So the point there is just that breach was the driver of the growth.\nChris Cartwright : Right. In the indirect?\nTodd Cello : Right, in the indirect channel, correct.\nChris Cartwright : The people's breaches as opposed to our own. So -- but then moving on to your question about the technology transformation, which again we spotlighted in this quarter, I feel like we are making great progress. We are well at pace to achieve the technology transformation benefits. Certainly, the ones that we outlined in the third quarter call from last year, and you're going to see a good deal of savings in 2024 because of those activities. And then the longer pole in the tent was the technology-specific savings that are largely enabled by OneTru that will come a little bit later, but we're definitely tracking to that. But just something I said earlier, we focused in the early days after our acquisitions on achieving integration savings and those are well in hand. The $80 million plus that we guided for Neustar and all the acquisitions for both Argus and Sontiq, we're very confident about delivering that, but what we've really been focused on now is reengineering our products in these integrated product suites in the seven families, leveraging what we think are best-in-class underlying platforms. OneTru, certainly, which includes the guts and the intelligence of all information products, be it data management, identity analytics and the ability to flexibly deliver that to the upstream product families. And of course, this underlying infrastructure utility layer, which we can now standardize across TransUnion, across all the products that reside on the suite, which is going to simplify a lot, take a lot of cost out and free up engineering cycles.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today will be from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Tom Rush [ph] on for Andrew. I want to touch on auto and ask if you saw any disruptions in the quarter from the CDK outage. And if there was any disruptions, are you kind of expecting a delay to impacting auto sales to up out July and third quarter volumes? Thank you.\nTodd Cello : As far as you go back to our prepared remarks, auto, we were pleased with the performance. We grew 3%. We saw a little bit of impact from that situation. And as we look forward into the second half of the year, again, kind of small impact. If it was something of significance, we would have flagged it for you. So we feel that it's managed. Perfect. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thank you for your time, and have a great rest of the day. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. Mortgage drove roughly half of our $15 million of revenue outperformance. The other half of outperformance was broad-based, principally in emerging verticals and international. Second quarter consolidated revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign currency. Our business grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the second quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.2% at the high end of our expectations and up 115 basis points compared to the year ago quarter due to flow-through on revenue growth and realization of transformation cost savings. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.99, an increase of 15%. Adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%. Finally, in the second quarter, we took $33 million of one-time charges related to the next phase of our transformation program, $15 million for operating model optimization, and $18 million for technology transformation. We incurred $76 million of one-time transformation expenses in the first half of the year and expect to incur approximately $200 million throughout 2024, driving at least $65 million of in-year operating expense savings. As part of our $355 million to $375 million program, we expect the remaining $75 million to $95 million of one-time expenses to be incurred in 2025. Looking at segment financial performance for the second quarter, U.S. markets revenue, which includes Consumer Interactive, was up 6% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was up 9%, and adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points to 39%. Our U.S. market segment benefited from a sequential increase in realized transformation cost savings. Financial services revenue grew 11%. Excluding mortgage, financial services revenue was down 2%. Trends were consistent with the levels seen in the first quarter. We continue to outperform softer volume activity driven by new business wins and successful cross-sell, including with NeuStar Solutions. In the third and fourth quarter, we expect improving financial services ex mortgage growth rates as comparisons ease in the back half of the year. Our credit card and banking business was down 2%. Activity remains tempered as lenders balance improving deposit basis and stabilizing delinquency rates against mixed consumer confidence. We are enabling our customers to navigate the current environment and position themselves for future growth with highly relevant products such as Trusted Call solutions, TruIQ's analytical suite, and our marketing solutions. Consumer lending revenue declined 3%. Fintech online activity remains muted but stable with a modest uptick in batch marketing. The short-term lending space remains soft. We continue to see wallet and new logo wins across both fintech and short-term lending as well as expanding new customer use cases. Our Auto business grew 3% despite continued headwinds in the auto market driven by our innovative credit solutions and new wins in Trusted Call Solutions. New vehicle sales continue to grow modestly but there remain affordability challenges across the market from higher interest rates in still high used car prices. We expect similar trends to persist throughout the year. For mortgage, revenue grew 53% against inquiry volume declines of 11%, modestly better than our expectations. We saw good prequalification volume supported by healthy shopping activity while mortgage originations remain down and significantly below historical averages. On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 9% of total TransUnion revenue. Emerging verticals grew 4% in the quarter led by insurance, public sector, tech retail and e-commerce, and media, offsetting modest declines in telco and tenant employment. Insurance grew 6% as market trends progress as anticipated which we expect to support growth acceleration in the second half of the year. Insurers are gradually increasing marketing activity as rate adequacy improves, driving demand for our credit-based marketing solutions as well as our suite of identity-based data hygiene, audience and analytic solutions. Consumer shopping activity remains strong. We continue to have a robust new business pipeline, particularly across our TruVision Driving History suite as well as cross-sell of Neustar and Sontiq Solutions. Public sector grew double digits with strength across credit, communications and fraud solutions as well as favorable project timing. Media and tech retail and e-commerce both grew mid-single digit. The overall marketing backdrop remains muted but stable and we delivered good growth in Trusted Call Solutions and our risk products. Elections grew modestly while telco and tenant and employment declined low single digit. Tenant employment year-over-year declines dissipated and we expect growth in the second half of the year as we lap the impact of our product recalibration and ramp recent new business wins. Turning to Consumer Interactive, revenue decreased 1%. Our indirect channel grew, benefited from continued breach wins. Our direct business declined as expected as we work through the impact of our recalibrated marketing strategy. For my comments about international, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 14% with five of our six reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 42.8% up 120 basis points. Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 27% on top of 35% growth in the prior year second quarter. We grew strongly in consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct to consumer, supported by healthy market trends. Our UK business returned to growth up 4% in the quarter. UK market continues to stabilize with improving inflation figures and expectations for lower interest rates, supporting gradually improving banking and fintech activity. Additionally, our consumer offerings as well as our insurance and gaming verticals drove strong performance. In Canada, we again delivered strong performance, growing 12% against flattish market volumes. Growth was broad based, benefiting from share gains and batch sales and financial services, strengthened insurance, and recent consumer indirect and breach wins. Into the second half of the year, we anticipate some deceleration in our growth rate in Canada as we lap sizable new business wins, but expect to deliver healthy and market leading performance. In Latin America, revenue growth accelerated to 13% with broad-based growth across regions. Colombia grew double digits, and we're starting to see the improving fintech growth after a period of retrenchment. Brazil also accelerated to double-digit growth driven by improving new business win momentum. In Asia Pacific, we grew 14%, led by very strong growth in the Philippines and another solid quarter in Hong Kong. Finally, Africa increased 10% with broad-based growth led by our retail vertical. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.2 billion of debt and $543 million of cash on the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.3 times. We made an $80 million debt prepayment in the second quarter and expect to make further prepayments over the course of 2024 with excess free cash flow after funding our transformation initiatives. Remember that we expect roughly $280 million of accrued onetime transformation expenses from the fourth quarter of 2023 through the end of 2024, with the majority paid out this year. In the quarter, we also successfully completed debt refinancing to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest expense. We refinanced $1.5 billion of our $2.2 billion Term Loan B5 into Term Loan B8 as well as our entire Term Loan A and revolving credit facility. We extended the maturity of the portion of our Term Loan B5 from 2026 to 2031 and our Term Loan A and revolving credit facility from 2028 to 2029. Additionally, we successfully removed the credit spread adjustment for the portion of our Term Loan B5, Term Loan A and revolving credit facility. Since announcing our Neustar acquisition, we have voluntarily prepaid $1.6 billion while executing on three refinancing transactions to lower our interest expense and extend our maturity profile. Net of our swaps, our all-in average effective cost of debt at today's rates is roughly 4.9% below the current SOFR rate. You can find two slides on our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. Based on our expectation for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low three times range by the end of 2024. We continue to work towards our leverage ratio target of under three times. We do not view 3 times as an ending point for deleveraging and view debt prepayment as an attractive use of cash. Turning to guidance. We are pleased with our outperformance over the first six months of the year, but our approach remains unchanged. We continue to assume muted economic growth throughout 2024 with steady lending volumes and no benefit from interest rate cuts. That brings us to our outlook for the third quarter of 2024. We expect foreign exchange to have a less than 0.5% impact on revenue and insignificant impact on adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to be between $1.044 billion and $1.06 billion or up 8% to 10% on an organic constant currency basis. Our revenue guidance includes approximately two points of tailwind for mortgage, meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 6% to 8% on an organic constant currency basis. Included in our guidance is a roughly 4.5% benefit from recent large breach remediation wins that we expect will be realized in the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $367 million and $380 million, up 3% to 7%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.2% to 35.8% or down 90 to 160 basis points. A few nuances on third quarter margin. The impact of our lower margin large breach wins is a roughly 80 basis points drag on quarterly margins. Additionally, the impact of normalizing incentive compensation when compared to last third quarter's low levels when we had a reversal of variable compensation accrual is a little over 100 basis points drag. Excluding those items, we expect to deliver strong underlying margin expansion, benefiting from revenue growth and the realization of our transformation savings. We also expect our adjusted diluted EPS to be between $0.97 and $1.02, up 6% to 12%. Turning to the full year. We now expect revenue to come in between $4.098 billion and $4.138 billion or up 7% to 8% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis. We expect our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage to be up about 4% to 5%. For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or up low-single digit, excluding mortgage. We anticipate financial services to be up low double digit or low-single digit growth, excluding mortgage. We expect mortgage revenue to increase about 50% based on mortgage inquiries being down over 5%. We expect inquiries to be down roughly 5% in the second half of the year. We expect emerging verticals to be up low single digit. We now expect Consumer Interactive to increase low-single digit, an increase from down low-single digit due to the breach wins. We continue to expect international to grow low-double digit. Turning back to the total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.455 billion and $1.485 billion, up 8% to 11%. That would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.5% to 35.9% or up 40 to 80 basis points. We anticipate adjusted diluted EPS to be $3.78 to $3.90, up 12% to 16%. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million. We expect the portion, excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions, to be about $245 million. We anticipate net interest expense will be about $250 million for the full year. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue. We continue to expect to incur approximately $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. Before wrapping up, I want to summarize the drivers of our guidance raise from what we guided in April. The increase in our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by two factors, first is our outperformance in the second quarter as we exceeded the high end of our revenue expectations by $15 million and adjusted EBITDA by $5 million; second, we expect our large breach wins to contribute roughly $40 million of revenue and $5 million of adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year, with the vast majority recognized in the third quarter. The margin profile of breaches can vary depending on the services offered. With the acquisition of Sontiq, we are now able to play a meaningful role in the breach market with end-to-end services to meet the needs of a particular event. The large breach wins we are servicing now utilize all of our services, including print notification, which collectively are lower margin. By comparison, the numerous small breaches we continue to win typically utilize the higher-margin services. These large breach wins build our momentum, credibility and relevance in the growing space. Importantly, excluding the breach benefit, our expectations for the second half of the year are unchanged from April as we maintain our prudent guidance approach. We continue to expect healthy revenue growth and strong underlying margin expansion in the back half of the year. We are pleased with the progress on our transformation programs and remain well on track to deliver at least $65 million of savings throughout 2024. I'll now turn the call back to Chris for some final comments. Hey, good morning, Jeff. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. So as it pertains to financial -- let's talk about financial services just in total, excluding mortgage. I know your question is about card and banking and consumer lending. But in the first quarter, we did grow 1%, and we just reported a decline of 2% in the second quarter. What we think is a more instructive way to look at it is to look at what actually happened in the first half of the year. And when you look at it on that basis, everything was pretty much flat. What we see there is simply a continuation of the trends that we saw exiting 2023. Needless to say, in Q3 of 2023, we saw a step down. And we've been pleased with what we characterized in our prepared remarks as a stabilization in our volumes. So when you look at the second half of the year, to your point, the volumes comparisons will definitely get easier where we're expecting in the third quarter, a low-single digit growth rate for financial services ex mortgage. But when you get into the fourth quarter because remember, the step down that we saw in 2023 was started really in September. So you saw the full run rate of that happen in the fourth quarter of 2023. So the comparable there look is about a mid-single digit grower in the fourth quarter that we're expecting. A lot of the focus, and rightfully so, is on how our volumes are performing, but it is also important to note that we do continue to win meaningful new logos, new business, as well as we've been successful within financial services and cross-selling Neustar capabilities. So the point in that is it's important to look at this a little bit more broader than just the volumes because there are other places that we have had some success. Good morning, Faiza. I'll take that question. Yes, we are pleased with the performance that we've had thus far with the emerging verticals, in particular, growing 4% in the latest quarter, but there are several moving pieces that I do feel are important to walk through. In our prepared remarks, we did speak about some good growth that we are seeing in insurance. The insurance vertical grew 6% in the quarter. As we think forward about that business, marketing continues on the recovery, which is a positive thing for the industry overall as rate adequacy has improved. And we're also seeing some strong shopping activity by consumers. So we expect that to continue on. Within the Emerging Verticals, it almost like I would think about segmenting where the growth came from. So insurance is clearly the standout because of its size and the growth that we're seeing, but also in the quarter, we saw good growth in public sector, which was a double-digit grower, broad-based, but the public sector business does have some project work in it, so that can be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, but nevertheless, was a meaningful contributor to the growth rate. Also, our tech retail and e-commerce and our media vertical grew greater than the 4% for Emerging Verticals overall, which we view as a very solid result because much of the marketing revenue that we just spoke about from Neustar and the joint capabilities that TransUnion has created, they reside in these two verticals. So when you look at insurance, public sector, tech retail, e-commerce, media that's where the vast majority of the growth is coming from. Offsetting that, we are seeing our collections business still growing, but lower than the overall growth rate for Emerging Verticals. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the tenant and employment business declined, but we expect that those declines have dissipated. We know they have, and we're going to see this business return back to growth with our recalibrated product offering. And then finally, something I always keep in mind, Chris just talked about our communications product suite, which TCS is part of, but our communications vertical houses many of the legacy Neustar products that are slow -- flattish to slow or declining growth and they're going to be a drag. So the net-net is you see some good growth from the vast majority of these verticals and then there are some offsets that are there. Thinking about this just relative to our guide for the second half of the year. As we said, we didn't change the guide. So with that being said, I think that we look at this and say that the risk in the Emerging Verticals skews more to the upside than to the downside for all the reasons that I just went through for each of the Emerging Verticals. Toni, I'm glad you asked the question because it's an important point. And it really just kind of reinforces the point that Chris just made in that when you look at the -- our performance, and let's do this for TransUnion in total, excluding mortgage. In the first quarter, we grew 5%. Second quarter, we grew 4% and now the growth rate at the high end, we're saying excluding the breach, because the breach wins that we've had a onetime nature, we'd be at about 3.5% in the third quarter. And then you can do the math and the implied is going to be about 3% for the fourth quarter. So clearly a step down from what we've seen. But just simply put, as Chris just said, we just feel it's the prudent thing right now to not get in a situation where we're raising expectations because the business in core financial services, I answered previously, it continues to be stable. We haven't seen that uptick yet happen. So as a result, we think what's best is for us to stick with the numbers that we put out going back to February for the second half of the year because things do still remain uncertain for us. So that second half guide is unchanged. And again, reinforcing no assumption of a lending recovery or any type of marketing recovery, benefit from a Fed rate cut. And I'll just leave you with Q1 and Q2. We guided 2% to 3%, and we were fortunate to be able to outperform that. And I can tell you that, that is what the team is working towards to do that in the second half of the year. Well, we have it on the slide, right? So that's what he's responding. That's what he's asking about. So we did have -- in our indirect channel, Shlomo, all we're doing is just characterizing where the growth is coming from in that channel and indirect, remember, it represents breach, but also our business with the premium players, the offer aggregators as well. So the point there is just that breach was the driver of the growth. Right, in the indirect channel, correct. As far as you go back to our prepared remarks, auto, we were pleased with the performance. We grew 3%. We saw a little bit of impact from that situation. And as we look forward into the second half of the year, again, kind of small impact. If it was something of significance, we would have flagged it for you. So we feel that it's managed. Perfect. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thank you for your time, and have a great rest of the day. Thanks."

            "name": "Chris Cartwright",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. And let me add my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll provide the financial highlights for our second quarter 2024 results. Second, I'll discuss OneTru and how we're modernizing our technology and product platforms. Finally, Todd will detail our second quarter results, along with our third quarter and full year 2024 guidance. Now, in the second quarter, TransUnion exceeded guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted diluted EPS. Given the strength in the quarter and recent large breach remediation wins, we're raising our full year 2024 guidance, which Todd will detail later. We expect a strong year for both revenue and earnings growth. With that said, we are maintaining our conservative guidance posture due to ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Revenue grew 8% on an organic constant currency basis, above our 5% to 6% guidance. Our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage, of 4% also exceeded our expectations. In the U.S., we experienced muted, but stable lending volumes that were consistent with the first quarter and well below historical trends. Consumer finances in the U.S. remain broadly healthy due to continued low unemployment and some real wage growth, but pressures on lower income consumers have led to waning spending activity. Inflation slowed in the quarter after a modest tick-up at the start of the year, and market expectations are for the Fed to start lowering interest rates later in the year. Consumer delinquencies rose slightly for mortgages and auto loans, but have begun to stabilize for credit cards and personal loans. Our U.S. market segments grew 6%. Financial services was up 11%, led by 50% plus growth in mortgage. Emerging verticals grew 4%, driven by strength across insurance, public sector, tech, retail, and e-commerce, and media. Within U.S. markets, NeuStar also delivered another solid quarter. Trusted Call Solutions continues to lead the way, growing more than 40% with positive contribution across our verticals. NeuStar delivered mid-single digit growth in the first two quarters of the year and remains on track for mid-single digit growth in 2024. Consumer Interactive declined 1%, as expected, and we believe we're closer to an inflection point to return Consumer Interactive to sustainable growth, supported by strong identity protection and breach wins, and progress in stabilizing our consumer direct offering. Our international segment grew by 14% on a constant currency basis. The 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 27% growth, while Asia Pacific, Latin America, Canada, and Africa all grew double digits. And finally, we prepaid $80 million in debt during the quarter and intend to make further prepayments in the second half of the year. We also completed a debt refinancing to extend our maturity profile and reduce our interest expense. We made strong progress with our technology modernization in the second quarter. Slide 5 illustrates how we're aligning TransUnion around a new global technology platform and solutions. By consolidating our powerful yet independent products into integrated suites on a next generation technology foundation, we believe that we can accelerate innovation, reduce cost, and leverage our solutions across our regions to drive revenue. Now to orient you on this visual from the bottom up, OneDev is the internal name for our new technology infrastructure operating system. OneDev standardizes our infrastructure services and developer tools in a single foundation to reduce cost and increase engineering productivity. In fact, it's the primary driver of our technology modernization savings. Built off of OneDev, OneTru is our core solutions enablement platform, which centralizes our common product services of data management, identity resolution, analytics, and delivery. OneTru is a key driver of innovation and revenue growth. And leveraging OneTru, our solutions are being integrated into end-to-end product suites under single brands, such as TruValidate fraud prevention and TruAudience marketing solutions. These integrated suites deliver dramatically better performance within clear global brand families. I'll now further explain how each technology layer creates value across the enterprise and share some examples of the benefits we've already delivered in our TruValidate fraud suite and Factor Trust alternative lending product. Now OneDev builds upon the success of Project Rise to create a global technology foundation common across our applications, reducing complexity, saving costs, and freeing engineering resources for innovation. OneDev creates a single technology operating plane that is cloud agnostic, preventing supplier lock-in. It also standardizes our developer utilities, creating a one-trans-union way for managing security, compliance, capacity provisioning, and software deployment. In addition to improving our developer productivity, OneDev will help us rationalize third-party software and other legacy technology costs. We will continue to operate our own private cloud infrastructure for certain applications where the economics are more attractive. OneDev provides the foundation for OneTru, which is our central data management, identity, and analytics hub. The platform standardizes the process of transforming raw data into actionable intelligence and deploying it within our product suites. This also allows our product specialists to focus on the data and analytic customization and workflow functionality needed to create innovative products. Let me detail the key processes that OneTru standardizes. OneTru integrates our data assets in credit risk, marketing, and fraud prevention into a unified data management environment. We embed strong permission and compliance controls to separate our credit and non-credit data. Our data scientists have easy access to our full complement of proprietary and public data for rapid, cross-functional development of insights. OneTru identity graphs link our offline and online data together for a consistent view of consumer identity, helping customers to reliably resolve identities across product lines and use cases. By servicing clients across risk, marketing, and fraud services, we participate in a broad feedback loop that reinforces our identity capabilities. OneTru Analytics Services consolidates and standardizes our tools and models in a single interface for use by our internal teams and customers alike. As new capabilities emerge, such as artificial intelligence or machine learning as a service, we can deploy these capabilities rapidly and at scale. And finally, OneTru's delivery layer leverages consistent and configurable technology for seamless delivery of our data and intelligence to customers for easier product upgrades and cross-selling. Now, I want to reinforce that OneTru already powers Heritage NeuStar marketing and fraud products, as well as our new enterprise identity graphs, our innovation labs, and our internal analytics environments. We're also launching a number of new products on OneTru this quarter, including TruValidate Fraud Prevention, TruAudience Marketing, and a number of enhancements to our advanced acquisition suite. We plan to continue this rapid pace of innovation and modernization over the next 18 months as we further refine and scale this platform. Now, TransUnion products will be integrated into broader functional suites built upon the world-class capabilities of the OneTru platform and then taken to market using the Tru portfolio brands. Over the last few years, we've organized our broad range of B2B products and our multitude of brands into several global product families. These global brand families clarify our offerings, they demonstrate the breadth of our capabilities, and make it easier for customers to find what they need. We continue to leverage our core competency in consumer identity to expand further beyond credit and risk into marketing and fraud prevention use cases. And we'll measure the success of our technology and product platform strategy in terms of driving better growth across credit, fraud, and marketing, as well as delivering on our cost savings targets. In the interim, we are tracking progress toward improving our product quality, our time to market, and the pace of innovation. So let me briefly spotlight the benefits that we're already seeing with TruValidate and FactorTrust. Our integrated TruValidate suite, powered by OneTru, combines our comprehensive identity data along with fraud signals from a range of NeuStar and TransUnion products. We aggregate the signal in our single platform where we apply advanced analytics to extract deep insights. The predictive uplift from consolidating all of our fraud signals and analytics onto OneTru has been notable. When we compare OneTru to our current in-market offerings, we see a 30% plus increase in fraud detection, along with a 75% decrease in false positives. This enhancement enables customers to better protect themselves while providing a friction-right experience for consumers. Now we're nearing the end of our beta testing for our first release with select customers. The initial results are extremely positive. We expect the first general release to be available later this quarter. Our fraud product suite serves thousands of customers today around the world and represents roughly $300 million in revenues last year against a multi-billion dollar addressable market. We aspire to be the customer's first call for fraud mitigation, and we see a substantial opportunity to gain market share with our integrated suite, which we know performs much better than the patchwork of point solutions so many customers use today. We're also in the process of modernizing FactorTrust, our short-term lending bureau within our TruVision suite, to OneTru over the course of 2024. The FactorTrust modernization serves as proof of concept of how OneTru can enhance our credit bureau capabilities across batch, online, and analytics. We're already taking foundational steps to migrate our core U.S. and Indian credit bureaus to OneTru starting early in 2025. OneTru is improving the speed and efficacy of FactorTrust, which we believe will strengthen our competitive positioning in the short-term lending space. We're seeing substantial improvement in the speed of batch processing from 24 hours to one hour, allowing faster on-demand retrospective analyses. Additionally, OneTru's modern delivery layer allows us to deliver enhanced data attributes and model upgrades seamlessly with improved model deployment, self-service analytics, and batch capabilities. We see opportunity for a near-term upgrade cycle, followed by more frequent and ongoing upgrades, strengthening our position for more competitive wins in the future. We look forward to continuing to update you on how OneTru platform is driving innovation across our product lines over the next several quarters. And now I'll hand it to Todd to provide further details on our second quarter financial results and our updated full year 2024 outlook. Todd? Thanks, Todd. And to wrap up, we exceeded second quarter expectations driven by mortgage growth and broad-based outperformance in emerging verticals in International. We achieved key milestones against our transformation and technology modernization programs reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitments. And we're raising our 2024 guidance behind the strong second quarter results and our recent breach wins. We remain focused and confident in delivering strong results in the current low growth market environment. Now let me turn it back over to Greg. Yeah. I would just reinforce a couple of points. I mean we view this as stable market conditions, even though technically, we are a bit negative in the two categories that you pointed out. I mean, naturally, you are going to expect some variations in and around the floor. And so we think these fluctuations are within a stable, but muted, lending environment. I think the more important takeaway is that we are demonstrating that, through our diversification and overall business model strength, we can grow even when the conditions are muted. And so we've got nice top-line growth, good fall-through margin improvement and the ability to delever despite the fact that we're still in kind of a stable -- I mean, kind of a stable, but depressed, market conditions. Now looking forward, when do we think we're going to actually start to see growth beyond just steady conditions against easing comps? Look, it's tough to predict, but the consumers are holding up pretty well because they're employed and they're enjoying some real wage growth. There has been increasing distress among sub-prime and lower-income consumers, but we think some of that is moderating. And as you point out, delinquencies are easing. The deposit bases within the banks are stabilizing. And I think that means we're getting closer to market conditions, where marketing activity and the customer acquisition is going to improve. Of course, if the Fed does come through with any rate reductions in the second half of the year, that would be additive to our forecast at this point. Well, first, quickly on the margin question because that's probably faster to address. Yes, 32% is our guide for the year. And we do believe that there's upside to those margins as we complete the realization of the acquisition synergies as we complete the technology modernization that we outlined in the third, fourth quarter environment last year. And also, as we return to more normalized marketing conditions, marketing has been in retreat for about 12 months plus now and our marketing products tend to be higher margin than the communication products because there's a lower cost of goods sold associated with them. So we also have some mix headwinds that are keeping Neustar margins a little bit lower than we expect in more normalized conditions. Now if you look across the board, we're having a pretty good year in fraud with Neustar, we're having a softer year in marketing relative to our guidance, and it's because of the pressures on businesses to find efficiencies in marketing in a more difficult environment. And we're doing pretty well on communication solutions, in particular, the subcomponent of communications, which is Trusted Call Solutions where we're getting really outsized growth because we've got a product that's getting great market acceptance, and we're going to continue to ride that. On the innovation front, we are very close to launching the next generation of our integrated marketing products, a unified marketing solution that combines the best of heritage TransUnion and Neustar on a single integrated platform. And that's one of the reasons why we took the time in this earnings call to focus on the many components of OneTru in the tech transformation because this next-generation solution is built upon OneTru. And also on OneDev, the underlying foundation. And it's going to bring together all of the data, the marketing audience data, all of the identity data and resolution capabilities in the range of identity, hygiene, audience planning, activation and media measurement services in a single integrated system. So we expect that to launch late third quarter. And rolling into next year, we think we're going to see material acceleration in growth there regardless of market conditions. We're also excited because we've achieved the same kind of product innovation milestone in the fraud world. We are launching the next-generation TruValidate fraud solution. We highlighted it in my section of the earnings. You can see it performs dramatically better. And it's been a point of integration and consolidation of the various fraud solutions that we have either acquired or built in different geographies through the year on the common Neustar platform. And by aggregating all of that signal and bringing advanced analytics against it, we're able to identify fraud far more effectively, but also reduce false positives, which saves our customers a lot of needless labor. So I'd say in the broad, Andrew, we're kind of moving from the acquisition integration phase, and we're kind of deeply now in the acquisition innovation phase. Yeah. And I think that's just kind of an important point philosophically to emphasize really to all of the analysts and investors on the call is that we're maintaining our guidance posture of beat and hold as opposed to beat and raise, right? And so we're letting the beats flow through, but we're maintaining the same conservative expectations in the future quarters in the second half of the year that we did at the outset of the year. And we think that's more prudent given the gyrations in the macro market over the past couple of years and some of the difficulty in forecasting the business. And we feel like we're well positioned to deliver against the guidance that we're reinforcing in this call. Yeah, Kelsey. Well, breach is a large and growing market. And you only have to follow the news for a few weeks, and you're going to see major companies sustaining breaches. With the acquisition of Neustar -- I'm sorry, with the acquisition of Sontiq, and the investments that we've made, we feel like we have emerged as a significant player in breach now. And our brand is such that we are kind of in the deal flow, and we've got the broad set of capabilities to service small and large needs alike, reach needs that skew through the physical or the digital. We've got the comprehensive range of services and we're going to compete more effectively win share and have a higher sustainable level of breach revenues. Now that said, you are correct. These deals are episodic. Sometimes, you're going to have big ones, sometimes we may not have the big one in the quarter. And that's why we've taken pains to really call out this higher than usual level of breach wins in the third quarter. I think it's also important to understand that these breach wins come with attractive margins. They may not be quite as high as our enterprise margins in total, but they're not dramatically different, right? So I would hate for an analyst to look at what we're reporting in the third quarter and conclude that, that's the typical margin of the breach business. Third quarter financial performance really is just about the timing of revenue arrival against the expenses. And on these particular breaches, we're doing broad physical notification through the mail, and we're just paying a lot of postage. What it doesn't include is the much higher tail of revenue that's going to continue for the next year or two related to the digital services associated with these wins. So we look at the breaches on a deal-by-deal basis, they are attractive to margin, it's fast growing. And we think we're much better positioned to compete for them going forward. Yeah, Manav, I love the question. So let's talk about our global operating model. Certainly, we've got countries and we have vertical leadership within those countries that focus on the specific wants and the needs and the use cases for our products that are most relevant within those verticals. But we also have a parallel product organization, our solutions organization. And we have defined leadership and product management teams that align directly to the product families that you see. So if you were here, I could introduce you to our marketing lead, our fraud lead, our consumer lead, et cetera. And so it is much like a large global software company that's going to have a product leader overseeing a particular category of software or a consumer packaged goods company that's going to have a category manager. But then they are interfacing with the folks that lead the go-to-market in the countries or the specific verticals. Yeah. Good question, Heather. So we talked a lot about a consumer in recent calls and the three portions of consumer. And that the most challenged one has been the direct-to-consumer subscription business that we have through transunion.com and other properties. And what we're seeing now is that the rate of decline is slowing and slowed in the second quarter. We expect it to slow further in the third and reach kind of an equilibrium point or kind of low-single digit declines by the fourth quarter of this year. And that will really reduce the drag on earnings from this piece of the business in the larger indirect piece where there has been really a mix of success for the freemium players and revenue pressure from the subscription players and just more kind of competition for share in that, we're seeing stabilization, and we're getting growth out of that segment. And then what's really helping our results the most is the multiyear mid-double digit compounding that we're getting out of Sontiq. So Sontiq grew 20% last year, it was a great year, driven in part by success in breach, but also in underlying identity subscription sales. And this year, we're positioning ourselves for another year of really strong growth. Now stepping back a bit, we still firmly believe that we're going to return the consumer business in total to consistent revenue growth, to consistent compounding. And we're going to pursue each of the monetization options to make that happen. So we're going to continue to do well on the subscription front. We're going to improve our capabilities in terms of offering supporting offers directly to consumers, both through our web properties, but also enabling other players to do so in the marketplace. And we're going to build upon the momentum in identity and breach remediation. Okay. Well, thanks for both of your questions there. And look, there was nothing unusual in the breach activity I mean the only, I guess, unusual or new thing is our ability to compete and win these big breach jobs. And we won several of them, and we're getting the benefit of that in the third quarter, but the second quarter, it's not really a factor. Right. In the indirect? The people's breaches as opposed to our own. So -- but then moving on to your question about the technology transformation, which again we spotlighted in this quarter, I feel like we are making great progress. We are well at pace to achieve the technology transformation benefits. Certainly, the ones that we outlined in the third quarter call from last year, and you're going to see a good deal of savings in 2024 because of those activities. And then the longer pole in the tent was the technology-specific savings that are largely enabled by OneTru that will come a little bit later, but we're definitely tracking to that. But just something I said earlier, we focused in the early days after our acquisitions on achieving integration savings and those are well in hand. The $80 million plus that we guided for Neustar and all the acquisitions for both Argus and Sontiq, we're very confident about delivering that, but what we've really been focused on now is reengineering our products in these integrated product suites in the seven families, leveraging what we think are best-in-class underlying platforms. OneTru, certainly, which includes the guts and the intelligence of all information products, be it data management, identity analytics and the ability to flexibly deliver that to the upstream product families. And of course, this underlying infrastructure utility layer, which we can now standardize across TransUnion, across all the products that reside on the suite, which is going to simplify a lot, take a lot of cost out and free up engineering cycles."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to the TransUnion First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the call to Greg Bardi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nGreg Bardi: Good morning, and thank you for attending today. Joining me on the call are Chris Cartwright, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Todd Cello, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  \n We posted our earnings release and slides to accompany this call on the TransUnion Investor Relations website this morning, and they can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed this morning. Our earnings release and the accompanying slides include various schedules, which contain more detailed information about revenue, operating expenses and other items, as well as certain non-GAAP disclosures and financial measures along with the corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures.  \n Today's call will be recorded, and a replay will be available on our website. We will also be making statements during this call that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements because of factors discussed in today's earnings release and the comments made during this conference call and in our most recent Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the SEC. We do not take any -- we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.\n  With that, let me turn it over to Chris. \nChristopher Cartwright: Thanks, Greg, and let me have my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll provide the highlights of our first quarter 2024 results, including an update on our progress against our transformation initiatives. Second, I will discuss our India growth story. And finally, Todd will detail our first quarter results, along with our second quarter and full year 2024 guidance. \n In the first quarter, TransUnion significantly exceeded guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Given the strength in the quarter, we are raising our full year 2024 guidance, which Todd will describe later, while still maintaining a conservative guidance posture given still tepid market conditions and macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.  \n Revenue in the quarter exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company's history, growing 8% plus on an organic constant currency basis, well above our 3% to 4% guidance. Mortgage drove much of the outperformance due to better-than-expected third-party score and credit report price realization as well as slightly better prequalification volumes.  \n We expect much of the pricing benefit to persist throughout the year, increasing our expectation for mortgage growth. However, our mortgage volume assumption remains conservative as in February. And in fact, we have trimmed volume expectations for the second half of the year despite the strong start to provide further cushion against an uncertain mortgage market backdrop.  \n Our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage of 5%, also exceeded our expectations, led by international as well as key emerging verticals such as insurance, media, public sector and collections. U.S. markets grew 7% with financial services up 13% and emerging verticals up 4%. Consumer Interactive declined 2% as expected.  \n Consistent with the fourth quarter, muted but stable economic conditions and lending volumes supported financial services growth. Consumer finances in the U.S. remained healthy due to low unemployment and real wage growth. Inflation has moderated, but remains above target and market expectations have reverted to higher for longer interest rate forecasts.  \n Lending standards remain tight as lenders face potentially increasing capital requirements as well as rising delinquencies, albeit still within historical averages. The banks echoed these sentiments during recent earnings calls, reporting subdued loan and deposit growth as they balance consumer resiliency against continued market uncertainty.  \n Within U.S. markets, Neustar delivered another good quarter, and we remain on target to grow mid-single digits in 2024. Communications, marketing and risk all contributed, led by robust growth in Trusted Call Solutions. Our international segment grew by 15% on a constant currency basis, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 31% growth, while Canada, Asia Pacific and Africa, again grew double digits.  \n Finally, we achieved key milestones in our transformation program, reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitments. Let me address this in more detail. As we discussed last quarter, our transformation efforts comprised 2 complementary programs, optimizing our operating model by further leveraging our global capability centers or GCCs, and modernizing our technology capabilities.  \n We believe these initiatives will accelerate innovation, streamline workflows, reduce costs and ultimately position us to deliver better experiences to meet the evolving needs of customers and consumers. In our operating model optimization program, we substantially completed our local market workforce reductions and migration notices in the first quarter.  \n Concurrently, we're on track with our planned GCC hiring. We now have roughly 4,900 employees in our GCC network, and our talent acquisition in India, South Africa and Costa Rica is stronger than ever. As more work shifts to the GCCs, we're taking a rigorous approach to change management, systematically tracking and documenting knowledge transfer, training our leaders to manage increasingly global teams and developing a feedback loop to improve processes continuously.  \n We're also deliberately balancing the need for customer-centric work in markets with the opportunity to centralize, standardize and automate key global functions. In our technology program, we're modernizing our capabilities by completing our cloud transformation and leveraging Neustar's technology to consolidate the assets we've built and acquired in recent years on to OneTru, a common state-of-the-art solutions-enablement platform.  \n OneTru is becoming the platform for ingesting, managing, governing, analyzing and delivering data and insights. The OneTru platform integrates separate data and the analytic assets in credit risk, marketing and fraud prevention and concentrates them in a single, layered and unified environment.  \n We believe that OneTru will enrich our data quality, speed time to market and accelerate innovation, ultimately driving better growth across our credit fraud and marketing solutions. From a financial perspective, we expect OneTru will also save costs and enable us to rationalize applications and standardize global services.  \n These efficiencies will allow our engineers to focus more time on innovation. Finally, the standardized operating model will enable us to adapt more quickly to rapidly changing regulations and ensure compliant data usage. Our focus in 2024 and 2025 is in consolidating our U.S. and India products, data and analytics onto the platform in accordance with respective laws and regulations.  \n We made meaningful progress in the first quarter. We launched advanced acquisition in the U.S., which combines data enrichment with our credit and marketing capabilities for an integrated credit-based consumer prospect marketing solution. We also moved key capabilities of our short-term lending Credit Bureau, FactorTrust onto OneTru with full online solutions to follow, representing the first credit bureau applications on our new platform.  \n Finally, we began the process to move our U.S. and global internal analytics environments as well as our core U.S. credit onto OneTru over the next several quarters. These actions reinforce our confidence in delivering an expected $65 million of operating expense savings in 2024. And we continue to target $200 million of free cash flow benefit by 2026.  \n Now over the last 2 decades, TransUnion has built a leadership position in India, one of the most attractive global markets. We've grown our Indian business more than 30% every year since 2017, except for the pandemic year in 2020. And this market contributed roughly 1.5 points to total company growth in 2023.  \n We have a tremendous long-term opportunity to enable growth in the Indian market. India is the fifth largest economy in the world and the fastest growing with GDP expected to double by 2030. 2/3 of India's population is under the age of 35. And this segment alone comprises 890 million people, more than 3x the size of the U.S. adult population. These demographics drive economic growth and need a sophisticated consumer credit system to support an expanding aspirational middle class.  \n The Indian government remains highly focused on modernizing its economy, promoting financial inclusion and digital transformation initiatives. India's evolving economy creates high demand for credit, marketing and fraud solutions and we have built a unique market-leading business. The Credit Bureau TransUnion CIBIL was founded in 2000 and has become a household brand that is synonymous with credit reports. We have 640 million consumer records in our bureau, growing roughly 15% each year. We serve more than 6,000 institutions, including the largest banks, nonbanking financial institutions, fintechs and insurance companies. We also reach 100 million consumers directly through our consumer solutions.  \n As the leading credit bureau, we play an impactful role in the Indian credit economy. We closely engage with the regulatory and government institutions, such as the Reserve Bank of India and the Ministry of Finance to support initiatives focused on managing financial stability and systemic risk as well as driving financial inclusion. We also improve financial literacy through our education and awareness programs and our direct connections with more than 100 million consumers. And as I will describe in more detail later we enable credit penetration in critical underserved areas such as small and midsized businesses, agriculture and micro finance.  \n Our strategy in India exemplifies our enterprise vision to make trust possible between consumers and businesses in global commerce. India's market dynamics by themselves drive attractive growth with GDP growing nearly 8% and credit growing roughly 16% in 2023.  \n We expect strong volumes again in 2024, albeit with likely lower growth rates as the lending ecosystem takes a modestly more conservative stance. We have consistently outperformed the underlying market. However, driven by the same growth playbook that we use across our business.  First is client engagement or deepening client relationships to drive wallet share and share shift. We empower our verticalized sales force to focus on thematic selling, emphasizing our role as a trusted adviser to our clients. This enables us to build upon our already strong share in core consumer credit by expanding our suite of solutions and penetrating new lenders.  \n Second is product innovation. We continue to successfully bring innovation from other markets to India, such as trended credit data, and consumer education tools. Increasingly, we're driving end market innovation like our API marketplace and in areas such as financial inclusion, fraud and identity in open banking.  \n We're also exploring opportunities to bring Neustar capabilities such as Trusted Call Solutions and marketing products to the Indian market. Third is market adjacencies or India's version of emerging markets. Key focus areas are commercial, fintech and direct-to-consumer.  \n Commercial credit is unique to India. As we do not operate a commercial bureau in the U.S. We help Indian lenders assess the creditworthiness of businesses based on credit as well as bank statement, tax and trade data. From 2018 to 2023, we grew in India at a 27% compound annual growth rate. And the chart on Slide 9 highlights how the growth playbook enabled this market-leading performance.  \n Consumer credit grew at a 23% CAGR. Commercial fintech and direct-to-consumer grew to faster combined 36% CAGR and now represent roughly 40% of revenue. We believe, over time, our solutions outside of consumer credit can contribute 50% plus of our Indian revenue. We're only scratching the surface of the opportunities outside of consumer credit with the right to win given our scale and brand recognition, our breadth and the quality relationships that we have in the market as well as product innovation.  \n Much of our next generation of innovation focuses on enabling credit penetration in underserved sectors, all of which the Government of India has identified as key economic growth priorities. Our FIT Rank assessment uses credit and alternative data for sharper risk differentiation of small and midsized businesses. The solution enables lenders to better serve India's 63 million small and medium businesses, which contribute to 30% of India's GDP.  \n The CIBIL credit and farm report consolidates credit, satellite and other relevant agricultural data to begin to digitize historically manual and cumbersome agricultural lending process. Farming is the livelihood of 55% of the Indian population and agricultural loans account for at least 18% of the bank's lending portfolios. And the CIBIL microfinance report and score provides comprehensive data and analytics to serve the 70 million microfinance borrowers in India.\n Microfinance refers to collateral-free loans for lower income families. The loans average roughly $500 and typically focus on rural and remote areas. The Reserve Bank of India has specific mandates for lending to this segment of the population.  Close out, India is a multi-decade growth story for TransUnion. At our Investor Day, we targeted $300 million of revenue from India by 2025, and we are well on our pace to exceed that target. We continue to believe this business can deliver conservatively 20% plus growth over the medium term.  \n And our next goal is to build India into $0.5 billion over the next several years. Now Todd will provide further details on the first quarter financial results and our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. Todd? \nTodd Cello: Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. Before I begin, I wanted to highlight our updated segment reporting. Starting this quarter, we are reporting our Consumer Interactive business within our U.S. market segment. Additionally, we have shifted certain revenue between U.S. financial services, U.S. emerging verticals and our International segment. These actions better align our reporting to how we run the business under our U.S. markets and international [ presidents ] . \n We have provided recast 2022 and 2023 quarterly results for the updated reporting in an 8-K filed on Tuesday and have posted the details to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided incremental vertical revenue mix disclosure for our U.S. financial services, U.S. emerging verticals and Consumer Interactive businesses for fiscal year 2023.  \n As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 9% on a reported basis, and 8% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and a less than 1% benefit from foreign currency.  \n Our business grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, ahead of our expectations and up 80 basis points compared to the year ago quarter due to flow-through on revenue growth.  \n First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.92, an increase of 14%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%. Finally, in the first quarter, we took $43 million of onetime charges related to the next phase of our transformation program, $24 million for operating model optimization and $19 million for technology transformation.  \n We continue to expect to incur roughly $200 million of onetime expenses in 2024, driving $65 million of in-year operating expense savings. As part of our $355 million to $375 million program, we expect the remaining $75 million to $95 million of onetime expenses to be incurred in 2025.  \n Looking at segment financial performance for the first quarter. U.S. markets revenue, which now includes Consumer Interactive, was up 7% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was up 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin was down 20 basis points to 36.2%.  \n Financial Services revenue grew 13% with trends broadly consistent with the levels seen in the fourth quarter. Excluding mortgage, Financial Services, revenue was up 1%. Consumer lending revenue returned to growth, up 2% in the quarter. Activity remained muted as fintechs and others remain cautious given rates and market uncertainty.  \n New customer and wallet share wins across fintech, buy now pay later, and short-term lenders offset some of the softness and contributed to growth. Our credit card and banking business was flat. While issuance is healthy on a historical basis, online and batch activity remains tempered as lenders manage rising delinquencies.  \n We are enabling our customers to navigate the current environment and position themselves for future growth with highly relevant products such as our TruVision Risk Solutions, TruIQ's analytical suite, Trusted Call Solutions and our TruValidate fraud offerings. Our auto business grew 2% despite continued headwinds in the auto market, driven by new business wins and growth from captive auto lenders.  \n Consumers, particularly near prime and subprime continue to face affordability challenges from higher interest rates and declining, but still high used car prices. Improved new vehicle inventory has provided some increased credit volume as well as interest from OEMs and dealers and noncredit solutions as they seek to acquire more customers.  \n We are seeing strong momentum selling Neustar marketing and Trusted Call Solutions into the auto space. For mortgage, revenue grew 52% against inquiry volume declines of 8%. Outperformance related to higher-than-expected price realization on third-party scores and credit products. Volumes were also slightly higher than our expectations, especially in prequalification.  \n Relative to prequalification volume, shopping activity has been healthy, and to date, we have not seen much incremental pressure from the extension of the GSE prequalification program. We are pleased with the strong mortgage growth in the quarter, but given uncertainty around interest rates, origination volumes an uptake of these newer prequalification programs, we continue to take a conservative view on our mortgage guidance for the year.  \n On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 8% of total TransUnion revenue. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 4% in the quarter. Insurance, media, public sector and collections led the way for growth.  Telecommunications in tech, retail and e-commerce grew modestly, while tenant and employment screening declined as expected.  \n Our appendix slide provides helpful detail on the relative sizing of each of these verticals. In Insurance, we delivered improved growth with market trends progressing as expected to start the year. Select underwriters are starting to resume marketing activity as rate adequacy improves, with broader recovery expected as the year progresses. Healthier backdrop supports credit-based marketing volume as well as increased demand for our suite of marketing products, such as identity-based data hygiene and targeted audience solutions.  \n Consumer shopping activity remains strong. We continue to deliver significant new business wins across our core products as well as with innovative products like TruVision driving history, successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions and penetration of the life and commercial insurance market.  \n Media, public sector and collections all grew double digits. Media benefited from marketing identity and audience wins and a stabilizing market backdrop. Public sector and collections were again powered by strong growth in Trusted Call Solutions, along with fraud volumes in the public sector.  \n Telco was up slightly in line with the recent trajectory and our growth expectation for the vertical, which includes many of our legacy communication solutions like landline caller ID. Tech, retail and e-commerce was also up modestly as it comped against project-based revenue in the prior year. Tenant and employment screening declined as expected as we work through the recalibration of our solutions. We expect better performance in the second half of the year as we lap the impact of these actions.  \n Turning to Consumer Interactive. Revenue decreased 2%. Our indirect channel grew benefiting from continued breach wins. Reach revenues can be uneven, but we are accelerating our pace of wins largely on the strength of Sontiq offerings. Our direct business declined as expected as we work through the impact of our recalibrated marketing strategy.  \n We are making good progress on broadening our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in this business. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 15%, with 4 of our 6 reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.2%, up 230 basis points.  \n Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 31%. We delivered growth across consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer supported by strong market trends. In the U.K., revenue was flat. The U.K. fintech market remains subdued but has stabilized, and we continue to see solid growth in banking and insurance, setting us up for some improvement as the year progresses.  \n TruVision trended data, affordability-oriented solutions and our consumer offerings continue to drive new wins. Canadian business delivered another quarter of very strong performance, growing 18% despite a muted macro environment. We benefited from share gains in financial services, strong growth in telco and insurance, momentum in Consumer Indirect and recent breach wins.  \n Growth in Canada was also a bit better than anticipated due to healthier online volumes. Looking ahead, as we lap sizable new business wins, we expect growth in subsequent quarters to return to high single digits, which still represents market-leading performance in Canada.  \n In Latin America, revenue was up 7%. In Colombia and other Latin America countries, we delivered broad-based growth with stabilizing market conditions after a softer second half 2023. Brazil was flat after a few quarters of declines, and we expect further improvement as the year progresses. In Asia Pacific, we grew 17%, driven by very strong growth in the Philippines and another solid quarter in Hong Kong.  \n Finally, Africa increased 12% led by our retail and insurance verticals.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.3 billion of debt and $434 million of cash. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.5x. You can find our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. We did not make debt prepayments in the first quarter, but expect to make some prepayments over the course of 2024 with our excess free cash flow.  \n Our focus this year remains on executing against the transformation initiatives. We expect most of our $355 million to $375 million of onetime transformation expense to be paid out in 2024. Based on our expectation for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low 3x range by the end of 2024.  \n We continue to work toward our leverage ratio target of under 3x. We do not view 3x as an ending point for deleveraging and viewed debt prepayment as an attractive incremental use of our cash over the medium term. Turning to guidance. Even after a strong start to the year, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to assume muted economic growth throughout 2024 with steady lending volumes and no benefit from interest rate cuts.  \n That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We expect foreign exchange to have an insignificant impact on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to be between $1.017 billion and $1.026 billion or up 5% to 6% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis.  \n Our revenue guidance includes approximately 3 points of tailwind from mortgage.  Meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 2% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect mortgage revenue growth in the second quarter to be slightly lower than the 52% we experienced in the first quarter.  \n We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $366 million and $372 million, up 8% to 10%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 36.0% to 36.3% or up 90 to 120 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.95 and $0.98, up 11% to 14%.  \n Turning to the full year. We expect insignificant impact from foreign exchange on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $4.023 billion and $4.083 billion or up 5% to 6.5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis.  \n Our increased guidance is driven entirely by mortgage, specifically from better-than-anticipated price realization on third-party scores and credit reports. 2024, our mortgage inquiry assumption is unchanged at down 5%. However, we now expect our mortgage revenue to increase about 50%, up from 25% prior. We now expect inquiries to be slightly better in the first half of the year, but still down 10% and for the second half volumes to be flat.  \n We expect our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage, to be up about 2% to 3.5%. We are pleased with our nonmortgage outperformance in the first quarter, but continue to take a deliberately conservative approach to the rest of the year, given continued market uncertainty.  \n For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or up low single digit, excluding mortgage. We now anticipate Financial Services to be up low double digit or low single-digit growth, excluding mortgage. We continue to expect emerging verticals to be up low single digit, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digit. We now anticipate that International will grow low double digit in constant currency terms driven by broad-based positive trends and led by India.  \n Turning back to the total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.433 billion and $1.475 billion, up 7% to 10%. And would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.6% to 36.1% or up 50 to 100 basis points. Anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $3.69 to $3.86, up 10% to 15%.  \n We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $245 million. Anticipate net interest expense would be about $250 million for the full year, up $5 million from prior guidance due to higher SOFR. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue.  \n And as previously noted, we continue to expect to incur $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. I'll now turn the time back to Chris for some final comments. \nChristopher Cartwright: Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up the call this morning, we exceeded first quarter expectations driven by mortgage outperformance, international momentum, good growth from key emerging verticals like insurance and media and stable lending volumes in the U.S. financial services.  \n We achieved key milestones against our transformation program, reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitment. And we're raising our 2024 guidance behind the strong first quarter results and better mortgage price realization. We remain focused and confident in delivering strong results in the current low growth market environment. Let me turn it back to Greg. \nGreg Bardi: That concludes our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we can begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. \nAndrew Steinerman: Chris, I was encouraged to hear that Neustar remains on track and that communications, marketing and risk all contributed. I was hoping you could just give us some more details on kind of the current trend in Neustar and aspirations there? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, sure, Andrew. Yes, Neustar posted a solid first quarter, very consistent with our full year guide, and we had positive growth across each of the 3 principal product lines. Directionally, communication still is posting the highest growth rates, and that's driven by our suite of Trusted Call Solutions and new sales of that continue to be very strong. So that's encouraging. \n We also feel good about the rate of growth in marketing. This year -- this quarter was particularly strong in marketing, and we called out the media vertical that reflects some of the big sales that we had in the media vertical last year. We had a couple of clients in particular that consolidated their business on our audience platforms, which is encouraging. \n And in the first quarter, we will start to lap those sales from last year in the second quarter, right? But it was a standout in the first quarter. And then we've had some acceleration this year in the risk/fraud portion of Neustar, particularly around our collections and communication solutions. \n So from a revenue perspective, it was quite solid, and we feel solid in the guide for the year. I think it's also important to note in terms of Neustar progress. We're still really confident on achieving the integration savings. We raised up to $80 million. We feel very good about that. And of course, we're striving to outperform that number and will keep you updated as the year progresses. \n Beyond that, there's a ton of technology benefit that we are taking advantage of currently. We've talked about OneTru as our central data management platform and OneTru began, of course, within Neustar as their next-generation platform, and we've extended it to meet the broader TransUnion enterprise needs. But in addition to OneTru, over these past couple of years, we've done a ton of work to integrate our marketing and fraud solutions. \n And when you do this type of hardcore engineering integration, you move sideways from a product and innovation perspective for a period. But once you pulled everything together, you get a broader and more integrated solution, truly the best of both organizations. And we expect that work in marketing and fraud to be behind us as we enter in the second half and the third quarter of this year. \n So in my view, while we're posting good results in Neustar in a difficult environment, the best in terms of our product offering has yet to come, and you're going to see that emerge later this year. \nOperator: The next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to ask about mortgage since that was driving the guidance raise. I guess what was better than what you had anticipated in mortgage? I know you mentioned the [ prequal ] volumes and shopping behavior. But I guess what drove the pricing and what gives you confidence that sort of this level of outperformance will continue through the course of the year? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. And thanks for the question, Faiza. It's a very essential question to understanding both the quarter and the full year guide. As we were budgeting and forecasting '24, it was complicated because there are a lot of moving parts in the forecast, given interest rates and market volume uncertainties, but also the new early assessment program by the GSEs, which were -- which was likely going to have an impact on mortgage prequalifications. \n Consistent with our overall conservative guidance posture, we were conservative on all of these dimensions of mortgage guide. Now what we saw in the first quarter is that volumes were a little better than expectations, but not hugely better and just absolute mortgage volume is a difficult thing to predict, as we all know. \n But the assumptions we made about the proportion of prequalifications that we would get and the third-party score price we would realize on those prequalifications as well as the price realization of the credit portion, those -- all those assumptions turned out to be conservative, right? \n So in addition to that, we think, and this is really our hypothesis is that now that mortgage lenders don't have to pull 3 credit reports and incur that cost of 3 reports and 3 scores at qualification, it's enabling some additional consumer shopping. So there may be some benefit coming from that as well because our qualification volumes were again beyond the conservative forecast that we put in place. \n So the combination of all of those things led to material outperformance in mortgage. We booked what we achieved in the first quarter and then we maintained or actually made a bit more conservative volume expectations for the remainder of the year, simply because it's a fluid market. There's a lot of uncertainty, and there have been a lot of changes. Now Todd, I think you can probably get into some more of the specifics here. I think that would be helpful. \nTodd Cello: Absolutely. So Faiza, thanks for the question. And one point that I want to start with, just to make certain that's clear to everyone is that TransUnion includes the prequalification volumes that Chris was just speaking about in our overall volumes. \n So when you see our volume number, that's including the [ prequal ].  So what that means when Chris was talking about shopping activity being better, you have to keep that in mind that that's, in essence, one of the drivers that we saw to keep the expectations on volumes a little bit better from what we had guided. \n So from there, if you look at our guidance back in February compared to what we put out this morning, starting with revenue, you'll notice that we've increased the revenue by 25%. So now we're expecting mortgage to grow 50% instead of 25%. But back to the volumes we are expecting volumes for the full year to remain the same at down 5%. \n Now in the first half, we are expecting the volumes to be a little bit better. Back in February, we had assumed a 15% decline. And now we are assuming a 10% decline. So in essence, you get a 5% pickup in the first half. Prequalification is a part of that. So keep that in mind. But then in the second half, if you go back to February, we were anticipating that we would grow 10% in our volumes. And that was just purely comparable. \n If you remember, the second half of 2023 was particularly weak. So what we've done is we've changed our second half assumption in essence, to be flat. So what that means is second half now has a decline of 10%. So what -- the reason that's important to call out is we are fully acknowledging the headwinds that we are experiencing in the market from a volume perspective with the 10-year treasury yield creeping up and 30-year mortgage rates higher. We are acknowledging that in our forecast. \n So the takeaway here is that this is just better price realization on third-party scores as well as reports. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: So Q2 guidance looks good. You just addressed mortgage, but maybe if you can more holistically kind of just address this concern that when rates moved higher kind of last summer, early fall, it created some incremental headwinds in various parts of your business. So just with rates moving higher recently, including again today, can you just talk about some other parts of the business where you saw headwinds last fall and maybe any sort of like changes in customer behavior or tone that you're hearing more recently on the back of a rate increase? \nTodd Cello: Thank you for the question. So to start off in response to that, I think what's important for everyone to remember that our initial guide back in February did not anticipate a benefit from lower interest rates. So we went into the year in essence, just very conservative. \n We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves and that proves to be a very good thing, right, as far as where interest rates appear to be headed. Trends in our core U.S. financial services business, I would say that they remain stable. You've heard from some of the bank earnings call, they used the words subdued. I think that we have appropriately captured these trends in our outlook. There's no significant upside contemplated there. It's more of a continuation of the trends that we're seeing. \n Some important reminders. TransUnion obviously, has a very diversified portfolio. And as a reminder, in 2022 and 2023, we grew 3% in both years. Now clearly, that's not what we planned for and that's not at all what we aspired for, but it shows the balance of the business, and that's intentional. So -- and with that also, we currently believe that interest rates perhaps may have peaked or maybe they won't go up much further. \n So what does that mean? Well, what it does is it drives certainty that didn't exist for our customers in the previous 2 years when interest rates were increasing in 2022 and 2023, our customers didn't know how much higher that they were going to go. So there's definitely some certainty there. \n Also, it's important to call out that our International business just continues to have strong momentum. In the February -- in our February guidance, we called for high single-digit growth from that business. We've increased that, even though we're maintaining in total. At the company level, we've increased to low double digits for International just based on this strong momentum that we're seeing in International. \n You flip back to the U.S. markets, the emerging verticals, it's important to call out there that many of those businesses are less dependent on interest rate movements. And this gets back to what I said at the beginning about the power of the diversified portfolio that we have. \n And I would say, we're seeing improving trends there. Nothing dramatic, but things are starting to get better. And then the last point I would make on this one is cutting across all of these businesses, TransUnion has a robust portfolio of solutions to help our customers no matter what the macro environment presents them. \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. And look, if I can reinforce a couple of points. The volumes that we experienced in the first quarter, particularly in U.S. Financial Services are consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. The challenge is, as you know, Jeff, in September of the third quarter of last year, the combination of increased rates and a real stress on bank deposits led to a material step down in origination volumes, right? \n Well, that appears to be flattening. And therefore, our growth is going to improve because we're not absorbing any material declines as we did in the second half of '23. \nOperator: The next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: Thank you for the disclosure on the emerging market or the emerging verticals, I guess, in your appendix. I was just wondering if -- just to follow up on that. In some of those 4 big categories in there. If you could just help us with how much they grew in '23 and how we should think about what you have factored in for '24? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Look, let me provide some quick color and I don't -- Todd may recall the specific growth rates per emerging segment in '23, but I'm more '24 focused. And look, overall, we're expecting higher growth from the emerging verticals in '24 than we experienced in '23. Starting with insurance, I think I said on an earlier call that we expected insurance to grow faster in '24, but not to return to the high single-digit growth that we've enjoyed consistently. \n So it's a healing process in terms of insurers returning to former marketing levels. We've seen some improvement in marketing. Of course, we've also had some really nice wins, particularly in the driver risk. So insurance is solid. As we mentioned, we had a solid growth in media, and that's because of the realization of some customer wins that we achieved last year. \n Public sector, our fraud products are helping us grow there. And finally, Manav, we're getting some nice growth in the collections area, right, as delinquencies rise, part of the compensation for our business model is increased collections. And of course, Trusted Call Solutions is a growth driver across all of these segments. In technology and real estate, in e-commerce, we're lapping some major project revenue. We're getting growth there, but it's more like the low mid-single-digit type of growth. And communications is always a blend. It's a combination of some heritage products that are either flat to declining slightly, but enhanced considerably by the Trusted Call Solutions suite. \n And then we are still working our way through some difficult comps on tenant and employment screening. As you know, because of the consent order that we signed with the CFPB last year, we've had to take certain products, certain data that did not meet the enhanced requirements that the CFPB has imposed on the industry. We're going to take those out of the market. We'll lap that comp by the second half of the year. But for right now, it's negative and a drag on emerging. So hopefully, that helps Manav. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous. \nKelsey Zhu: I was wondering if we can also talk a little bit about the growth we should expect for Sontiq and Argus in 2024 and how the margin profiles look like right now and kind of where you're targeting for 2024? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. So let's see, Sontiq, and then Argus. Well, the quick news on Argus, I think, is Argus has been completely integrated into the credit card and banking vertical within U.S. markets. And we've spent a lot of time on their next-generation platform, but also a lot of data hygiene and enhancement. \n So we've built a nice pipeline. We're getting some new sales and some conversions, and I continue to be very pleased that we've added this deeper, more authoritative view on how consumers are actually using their card to our overall foundation of credit information. \n Sontiq is growing very well. The key driver in Sontiq has been breach. As you know, in the fourth quarter, we reported really strong growth in consumer. It was almost entirely fueled by some breach revenues. So now that we've kind of matured our ability to sell this, I expect that we're going to continue to get good growth. \n But again, that is a more lumpy episodic type of product line, right? And so as we forecasted Sontiq for the year, we forecasted very solid growth from Sontiq, but not an extrapolation from what we experienced in the fourth quarter and a bit in the first quarter of this year. \nOperator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nToni Kaplan: I was hoping to ask about technology. You talked about the tech transformation, but just any update on AI and cloud, where you are today, any metrics we should be sort of looking at with regard to that and expense efficiencies and anything related? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. So let me survey the landscape on technology because multiple efforts that really check the boxes that you've talked about have converged into our next-generation foundational data management platform, which is OneTru. And think of that as all of the different data assets that we have, whether they be credit or marketing or fraud mitigation or public records are converging on a common set of functionality within OneTru. \n Now part of that is data ingestion, identity resolution, basic analytics and certainly feeding all of that into the different product suites that we have, be it credit marketing, public records, fraud, et cetera, right? And I think we've provided some schematics, so you can better understand that. \n But underpinning OneTru, we're using machine learning, variants of artificial intelligence to speed the ingestion of data, the quality assurance, the governance, certainly, the identity resolution or even launching a machine learning as a service in our enhanced analytics suite. So OneTru, now think of it as a comprehensive umbrella effort that's going to give us the type of one-to-many leverage from our technology that we've been steering toward. And of course, it's an entirely cloud architected, cloud native platform, all the data is stored within a fabric in the cloud or a common central repository, if you will. And it's also designed to be cloud agnostic because not all of our applications will go to the cloud. \n The majority of them will because the economics and the performance requirements make sense, but there are certain loads that we can handle more cost effectively in our internal private clouds, right? So as we've explained, there's a division there, and we've talked about that previously. So hopefully, that gives you some more flavor. \nOperator: The next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. \nHeather Balsky: I wanted to ask you about insurance, and I know it's come up already on the call with regards to marketing. But I'm curious about kind of the other aspects of the business in terms of what you've been seeing in terms of insurers leaving state, what's going on with shopping. It seems like the data that you guys put out, it was pretty good for the quarter. Just a broader environment for insurance and how you think about that for the rest of the year? \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes, Heather, it's probably worth refreshing kind of the basic dynamics that we're seeing in the insurance space. And look, as we all know, the past couple of years have been very tough for insurers. There's been an increase in frequency and severity of events and the replacement costs have skyrocketed, and it's led to P&C carriers pulling back from higher-risk regions, whether that's from wildfires or flooding or just a variety of natural disasters.  And that's meant reduced underwriting volumes. And what is underwritten is that at materially higher prices often that has to be absorbed by consumers. \n And also a reduction of marketing until the insurers could get a number of rate increases through different states in order to turn profitable on kind of individual policy economics. There's been a lot of progress in getting insurance priced right for this more challenging environment. And so we are seeing an increase in marketing. But still, the space is not fully healed, if you will. \n And I think that's going to take more time, probably another year, but we do expect '24 to be stronger on balance in insurance than '23 was. You also mentioned shopping activity, and you're right, and this is probably something that we all have some personal experience with. Upon renewal, consumers get sticker shock. \n And again, the price increases have been material for all the reasons that I talked about. And that does lead to some more shopping and shopping helps our business model. The other thing that's helping is a bit of an improved marketing environment and continued growth of our driver risk solutions as insurers are looking for ways to combat the increasing prices of state motor vehicle reports. \nOperator: Today's last question comes from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. \nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for providing those details around the India market, that's very encouraging. I just wanted to drill down on the international in general, very strong momentum in the first quarter. The guidance also implies strong growth, but that is moderate. I was just wondering if you can talk about puts and takes and any kind of conservatism that's baked into the guidance. \nChristopher Cartwright: Yes. Well, I would say our international forecast in total does reflect a similar prudent approach that we've tried to take across the enterprise. Obviously, we're really pleased with the first quarter, but we were careful not to extrapolate from those results across the full year. \n Canada, in addition to India is a real call out for many, many years now, that team has executed well, has won a lot of customers, has further penetrated the entirety of the customer base with a range of solutions and has been posting outside growth. We're doing great in South Africa and across Africa broadly. And again, India is a huge standout and a privilege for TransUnion to be able to participate in. \n Asia Pacific has also had a great rebound. We're seeing exciting things in the Philippines. We're very bullish about the potential for developing our franchise there. And LatAm is doing well, and we hope and expect to produce better results in Brazil. \n And look, in the U.K., the U.K. has been a tough slog. That economy has been through a lot. Inflation and interest rates have been very high. And we were probably overweighted there more toward short-term money lenders and fintech, which have had a particularly hard time in these past couple of years. \n Now that that's kind of flattening out, the robust growth we've been enjoying in kind of core mainstream banking is going to start to shine through as well as some of the diversifications into the gaming and gambling market in the U.K., which is quite well developed. Hopefully, I didn't leave anybody out as I went around the horn here, apologies. No offence intended, if I have. \n Look, international is rolling well and we expect to continue to post really good results this year. \nGreg Bardi: Great. That brings us to the end of today's call. Thank you for your time today, and have a great rest of the day. Thanks. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Cartwright",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg, and let me have my welcome and share our agenda for the call this morning. First, I'll provide the highlights of our first quarter 2024 results, including an update on our progress against our transformation initiatives. Second, I will discuss our India growth story. And finally, Todd will detail our first quarter results, along with our second quarter and full year 2024 guidance. \n In the first quarter, TransUnion significantly exceeded guidance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Given the strength in the quarter, we are raising our full year 2024 guidance, which Todd will describe later, while still maintaining a conservative guidance posture given still tepid market conditions and macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.  \n Revenue in the quarter exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the company's history, growing 8% plus on an organic constant currency basis, well above our 3% to 4% guidance. Mortgage drove much of the outperformance due to better-than-expected third-party score and credit report price realization as well as slightly better prequalification volumes.  \n We expect much of the pricing benefit to persist throughout the year, increasing our expectation for mortgage growth. However, our mortgage volume assumption remains conservative as in February. And in fact, we have trimmed volume expectations for the second half of the year despite the strong start to provide further cushion against an uncertain mortgage market backdrop.  \n Our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage of 5%, also exceeded our expectations, led by international as well as key emerging verticals such as insurance, media, public sector and collections. U.S. markets grew 7% with financial services up 13% and emerging verticals up 4%. Consumer Interactive declined 2% as expected.  \n Consistent with the fourth quarter, muted but stable economic conditions and lending volumes supported financial services growth. Consumer finances in the U.S. remained healthy due to low unemployment and real wage growth. Inflation has moderated, but remains above target and market expectations have reverted to higher for longer interest rate forecasts.  \n Lending standards remain tight as lenders face potentially increasing capital requirements as well as rising delinquencies, albeit still within historical averages. The banks echoed these sentiments during recent earnings calls, reporting subdued loan and deposit growth as they balance consumer resiliency against continued market uncertainty.  \n Within U.S. markets, Neustar delivered another good quarter, and we remain on target to grow mid-single digits in 2024. Communications, marketing and risk all contributed, led by robust growth in Trusted Call Solutions. Our international segment grew by 15% on a constant currency basis, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. India led with 31% growth, while Canada, Asia Pacific and Africa, again grew double digits.  \n Finally, we achieved key milestones in our transformation program, reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitments. Let me address this in more detail. As we discussed last quarter, our transformation efforts comprised 2 complementary programs, optimizing our operating model by further leveraging our global capability centers or GCCs, and modernizing our technology capabilities.  \n We believe these initiatives will accelerate innovation, streamline workflows, reduce costs and ultimately position us to deliver better experiences to meet the evolving needs of customers and consumers. In our operating model optimization program, we substantially completed our local market workforce reductions and migration notices in the first quarter.  \n Concurrently, we're on track with our planned GCC hiring. We now have roughly 4,900 employees in our GCC network, and our talent acquisition in India, South Africa and Costa Rica is stronger than ever. As more work shifts to the GCCs, we're taking a rigorous approach to change management, systematically tracking and documenting knowledge transfer, training our leaders to manage increasingly global teams and developing a feedback loop to improve processes continuously.  \n We're also deliberately balancing the need for customer-centric work in markets with the opportunity to centralize, standardize and automate key global functions. In our technology program, we're modernizing our capabilities by completing our cloud transformation and leveraging Neustar's technology to consolidate the assets we've built and acquired in recent years on to OneTru, a common state-of-the-art solutions-enablement platform.  \n OneTru is becoming the platform for ingesting, managing, governing, analyzing and delivering data and insights. The OneTru platform integrates separate data and the analytic assets in credit risk, marketing and fraud prevention and concentrates them in a single, layered and unified environment.  \n We believe that OneTru will enrich our data quality, speed time to market and accelerate innovation, ultimately driving better growth across our credit fraud and marketing solutions. From a financial perspective, we expect OneTru will also save costs and enable us to rationalize applications and standardize global services.  \n These efficiencies will allow our engineers to focus more time on innovation. Finally, the standardized operating model will enable us to adapt more quickly to rapidly changing regulations and ensure compliant data usage. Our focus in 2024 and 2025 is in consolidating our U.S. and India products, data and analytics onto the platform in accordance with respective laws and regulations.  \n We made meaningful progress in the first quarter. We launched advanced acquisition in the U.S., which combines data enrichment with our credit and marketing capabilities for an integrated credit-based consumer prospect marketing solution. We also moved key capabilities of our short-term lending Credit Bureau, FactorTrust onto OneTru with full online solutions to follow, representing the first credit bureau applications on our new platform.  \n Finally, we began the process to move our U.S. and global internal analytics environments as well as our core U.S. credit onto OneTru over the next several quarters. These actions reinforce our confidence in delivering an expected $65 million of operating expense savings in 2024. And we continue to target $200 million of free cash flow benefit by 2026.  \n Now over the last 2 decades, TransUnion has built a leadership position in India, one of the most attractive global markets. We've grown our Indian business more than 30% every year since 2017, except for the pandemic year in 2020. And this market contributed roughly 1.5 points to total company growth in 2023.  \n We have a tremendous long-term opportunity to enable growth in the Indian market. India is the fifth largest economy in the world and the fastest growing with GDP expected to double by 2030. 2/3 of India's population is under the age of 35. And this segment alone comprises 890 million people, more than 3x the size of the U.S. adult population. These demographics drive economic growth and need a sophisticated consumer credit system to support an expanding aspirational middle class.  \n The Indian government remains highly focused on modernizing its economy, promoting financial inclusion and digital transformation initiatives. India's evolving economy creates high demand for credit, marketing and fraud solutions and we have built a unique market-leading business. The Credit Bureau TransUnion CIBIL was founded in 2000 and has become a household brand that is synonymous with credit reports. We have 640 million consumer records in our bureau, growing roughly 15% each year. We serve more than 6,000 institutions, including the largest banks, nonbanking financial institutions, fintechs and insurance companies. We also reach 100 million consumers directly through our consumer solutions.  \n As the leading credit bureau, we play an impactful role in the Indian credit economy. We closely engage with the regulatory and government institutions, such as the Reserve Bank of India and the Ministry of Finance to support initiatives focused on managing financial stability and systemic risk as well as driving financial inclusion. We also improve financial literacy through our education and awareness programs and our direct connections with more than 100 million consumers. And as I will describe in more detail later we enable credit penetration in critical underserved areas such as small and midsized businesses, agriculture and micro finance.  \n Our strategy in India exemplifies our enterprise vision to make trust possible between consumers and businesses in global commerce. India's market dynamics by themselves drive attractive growth with GDP growing nearly 8% and credit growing roughly 16% in 2023.  \n We expect strong volumes again in 2024, albeit with likely lower growth rates as the lending ecosystem takes a modestly more conservative stance. We have consistently outperformed the underlying market. However, driven by the same growth playbook that we use across our business.  First is client engagement or deepening client relationships to drive wallet share and share shift. We empower our verticalized sales force to focus on thematic selling, emphasizing our role as a trusted adviser to our clients. This enables us to build upon our already strong share in core consumer credit by expanding our suite of solutions and penetrating new lenders.  \n Second is product innovation. We continue to successfully bring innovation from other markets to India, such as trended credit data, and consumer education tools. Increasingly, we're driving end market innovation like our API marketplace and in areas such as financial inclusion, fraud and identity in open banking.  \n We're also exploring opportunities to bring Neustar capabilities such as Trusted Call Solutions and marketing products to the Indian market. Third is market adjacencies or India's version of emerging markets. Key focus areas are commercial, fintech and direct-to-consumer.  \n Commercial credit is unique to India. As we do not operate a commercial bureau in the U.S. We help Indian lenders assess the creditworthiness of businesses based on credit as well as bank statement, tax and trade data. From 2018 to 2023, we grew in India at a 27% compound annual growth rate. And the chart on Slide 9 highlights how the growth playbook enabled this market-leading performance.  \n Consumer credit grew at a 23% CAGR. Commercial fintech and direct-to-consumer grew to faster combined 36% CAGR and now represent roughly 40% of revenue. We believe, over time, our solutions outside of consumer credit can contribute 50% plus of our Indian revenue. We're only scratching the surface of the opportunities outside of consumer credit with the right to win given our scale and brand recognition, our breadth and the quality relationships that we have in the market as well as product innovation.  \n Much of our next generation of innovation focuses on enabling credit penetration in underserved sectors, all of which the Government of India has identified as key economic growth priorities. Our FIT Rank assessment uses credit and alternative data for sharper risk differentiation of small and midsized businesses. The solution enables lenders to better serve India's 63 million small and medium businesses, which contribute to 30% of India's GDP.  \n The CIBIL credit and farm report consolidates credit, satellite and other relevant agricultural data to begin to digitize historically manual and cumbersome agricultural lending process. Farming is the livelihood of 55% of the Indian population and agricultural loans account for at least 18% of the bank's lending portfolios. And the CIBIL microfinance report and score provides comprehensive data and analytics to serve the 70 million microfinance borrowers in India.\n Microfinance refers to collateral-free loans for lower income families. The loans average roughly $500 and typically focus on rural and remote areas. The Reserve Bank of India has specific mandates for lending to this segment of the population.  Close out, India is a multi-decade growth story for TransUnion. At our Investor Day, we targeted $300 million of revenue from India by 2025, and we are well on our pace to exceed that target. We continue to believe this business can deliver conservatively 20% plus growth over the medium term.  \n And our next goal is to build India into $0.5 billion over the next several years. Now Todd will provide further details on the first quarter financial results and our second quarter and full year 2024 outlook. Todd? Thank you, Todd. And to wrap up the call this morning, we exceeded first quarter expectations driven by mortgage outperformance, international momentum, good growth from key emerging verticals like insurance and media and stable lending volumes in the U.S. financial services.  \n We achieved key milestones against our transformation program, reinforcing our confidence in delivering against our financial commitment. And we're raising our 2024 guidance behind the strong first quarter results and better mortgage price realization. We remain focused and confident in delivering strong results in the current low growth market environment. Let me turn it back to Greg. Yes, sure, Andrew. Yes, Neustar posted a solid first quarter, very consistent with our full year guide, and we had positive growth across each of the 3 principal product lines. Directionally, communication still is posting the highest growth rates, and that's driven by our suite of Trusted Call Solutions and new sales of that continue to be very strong. So that's encouraging. \n We also feel good about the rate of growth in marketing. This year -- this quarter was particularly strong in marketing, and we called out the media vertical that reflects some of the big sales that we had in the media vertical last year. We had a couple of clients in particular that consolidated their business on our audience platforms, which is encouraging. \n And in the first quarter, we will start to lap those sales from last year in the second quarter, right? But it was a standout in the first quarter. And then we've had some acceleration this year in the risk/fraud portion of Neustar, particularly around our collections and communication solutions. \n So from a revenue perspective, it was quite solid, and we feel solid in the guide for the year. I think it's also important to note in terms of Neustar progress. We're still really confident on achieving the integration savings. We raised up to $80 million. We feel very good about that. And of course, we're striving to outperform that number and will keep you updated as the year progresses. \n Beyond that, there's a ton of technology benefit that we are taking advantage of currently. We've talked about OneTru as our central data management platform and OneTru began, of course, within Neustar as their next-generation platform, and we've extended it to meet the broader TransUnion enterprise needs. But in addition to OneTru, over these past couple of years, we've done a ton of work to integrate our marketing and fraud solutions. \n And when you do this type of hardcore engineering integration, you move sideways from a product and innovation perspective for a period. But once you pulled everything together, you get a broader and more integrated solution, truly the best of both organizations. And we expect that work in marketing and fraud to be behind us as we enter in the second half and the third quarter of this year. \n So in my view, while we're posting good results in Neustar in a difficult environment, the best in terms of our product offering has yet to come, and you're going to see that emerge later this year. Yes. And thanks for the question, Faiza. It's a very essential question to understanding both the quarter and the full year guide. As we were budgeting and forecasting '24, it was complicated because there are a lot of moving parts in the forecast, given interest rates and market volume uncertainties, but also the new early assessment program by the GSEs, which were -- which was likely going to have an impact on mortgage prequalifications. \n Consistent with our overall conservative guidance posture, we were conservative on all of these dimensions of mortgage guide. Now what we saw in the first quarter is that volumes were a little better than expectations, but not hugely better and just absolute mortgage volume is a difficult thing to predict, as we all know. \n But the assumptions we made about the proportion of prequalifications that we would get and the third-party score price we would realize on those prequalifications as well as the price realization of the credit portion, those -- all those assumptions turned out to be conservative, right? \n So in addition to that, we think, and this is really our hypothesis is that now that mortgage lenders don't have to pull 3 credit reports and incur that cost of 3 reports and 3 scores at qualification, it's enabling some additional consumer shopping. So there may be some benefit coming from that as well because our qualification volumes were again beyond the conservative forecast that we put in place. \n So the combination of all of those things led to material outperformance in mortgage. We booked what we achieved in the first quarter and then we maintained or actually made a bit more conservative volume expectations for the remainder of the year, simply because it's a fluid market. There's a lot of uncertainty, and there have been a lot of changes. Now Todd, I think you can probably get into some more of the specifics here. I think that would be helpful. Yes. And look, if I can reinforce a couple of points. The volumes that we experienced in the first quarter, particularly in U.S. Financial Services are consistent with the fourth quarter of last year. The challenge is, as you know, Jeff, in September of the third quarter of last year, the combination of increased rates and a real stress on bank deposits led to a material step down in origination volumes, right? \n Well, that appears to be flattening. And therefore, our growth is going to improve because we're not absorbing any material declines as we did in the second half of '23. Yes. Look, let me provide some quick color and I don't -- Todd may recall the specific growth rates per emerging segment in '23, but I'm more '24 focused. And look, overall, we're expecting higher growth from the emerging verticals in '24 than we experienced in '23. Starting with insurance, I think I said on an earlier call that we expected insurance to grow faster in '24, but not to return to the high single-digit growth that we've enjoyed consistently. \n So it's a healing process in terms of insurers returning to former marketing levels. We've seen some improvement in marketing. Of course, we've also had some really nice wins, particularly in the driver risk. So insurance is solid. As we mentioned, we had a solid growth in media, and that's because of the realization of some customer wins that we achieved last year. \n Public sector, our fraud products are helping us grow there. And finally, Manav, we're getting some nice growth in the collections area, right, as delinquencies rise, part of the compensation for our business model is increased collections. And of course, Trusted Call Solutions is a growth driver across all of these segments. In technology and real estate, in e-commerce, we're lapping some major project revenue. We're getting growth there, but it's more like the low mid-single-digit type of growth. And communications is always a blend. It's a combination of some heritage products that are either flat to declining slightly, but enhanced considerably by the Trusted Call Solutions suite. \n And then we are still working our way through some difficult comps on tenant and employment screening. As you know, because of the consent order that we signed with the CFPB last year, we've had to take certain products, certain data that did not meet the enhanced requirements that the CFPB has imposed on the industry. We're going to take those out of the market. We'll lap that comp by the second half of the year. But for right now, it's negative and a drag on emerging. So hopefully, that helps Manav. Yes. So let's see, Sontiq, and then Argus. Well, the quick news on Argus, I think, is Argus has been completely integrated into the credit card and banking vertical within U.S. markets. And we've spent a lot of time on their next-generation platform, but also a lot of data hygiene and enhancement. \n So we've built a nice pipeline. We're getting some new sales and some conversions, and I continue to be very pleased that we've added this deeper, more authoritative view on how consumers are actually using their card to our overall foundation of credit information. \n Sontiq is growing very well. The key driver in Sontiq has been breach. As you know, in the fourth quarter, we reported really strong growth in consumer. It was almost entirely fueled by some breach revenues. So now that we've kind of matured our ability to sell this, I expect that we're going to continue to get good growth. \n But again, that is a more lumpy episodic type of product line, right? And so as we forecasted Sontiq for the year, we forecasted very solid growth from Sontiq, but not an extrapolation from what we experienced in the fourth quarter and a bit in the first quarter of this year. Yes. So let me survey the landscape on technology because multiple efforts that really check the boxes that you've talked about have converged into our next-generation foundational data management platform, which is OneTru. And think of that as all of the different data assets that we have, whether they be credit or marketing or fraud mitigation or public records are converging on a common set of functionality within OneTru. \n Now part of that is data ingestion, identity resolution, basic analytics and certainly feeding all of that into the different product suites that we have, be it credit marketing, public records, fraud, et cetera, right? And I think we've provided some schematics, so you can better understand that. \n But underpinning OneTru, we're using machine learning, variants of artificial intelligence to speed the ingestion of data, the quality assurance, the governance, certainly, the identity resolution or even launching a machine learning as a service in our enhanced analytics suite. So OneTru, now think of it as a comprehensive umbrella effort that's going to give us the type of one-to-many leverage from our technology that we've been steering toward. And of course, it's an entirely cloud architected, cloud native platform, all the data is stored within a fabric in the cloud or a common central repository, if you will. And it's also designed to be cloud agnostic because not all of our applications will go to the cloud. \n The majority of them will because the economics and the performance requirements make sense, but there are certain loads that we can handle more cost effectively in our internal private clouds, right? So as we've explained, there's a division there, and we've talked about that previously. So hopefully, that gives you some more flavor. Yes, Heather, it's probably worth refreshing kind of the basic dynamics that we're seeing in the insurance space. And look, as we all know, the past couple of years have been very tough for insurers. There's been an increase in frequency and severity of events and the replacement costs have skyrocketed, and it's led to P&C carriers pulling back from higher-risk regions, whether that's from wildfires or flooding or just a variety of natural disasters.  And that's meant reduced underwriting volumes. And what is underwritten is that at materially higher prices often that has to be absorbed by consumers. \n And also a reduction of marketing until the insurers could get a number of rate increases through different states in order to turn profitable on kind of individual policy economics. There's been a lot of progress in getting insurance priced right for this more challenging environment. And so we are seeing an increase in marketing. But still, the space is not fully healed, if you will. \n And I think that's going to take more time, probably another year, but we do expect '24 to be stronger on balance in insurance than '23 was. You also mentioned shopping activity, and you're right, and this is probably something that we all have some personal experience with. Upon renewal, consumers get sticker shock. \n And again, the price increases have been material for all the reasons that I talked about. And that does lead to some more shopping and shopping helps our business model. The other thing that's helping is a bit of an improved marketing environment and continued growth of our driver risk solutions as insurers are looking for ways to combat the increasing prices of state motor vehicle reports. Yes. Well, I would say our international forecast in total does reflect a similar prudent approach that we've tried to take across the enterprise. Obviously, we're really pleased with the first quarter, but we were careful not to extrapolate from those results across the full year. \n Canada, in addition to India is a real call out for many, many years now, that team has executed well, has won a lot of customers, has further penetrated the entirety of the customer base with a range of solutions and has been posting outside growth. We're doing great in South Africa and across Africa broadly. And again, India is a huge standout and a privilege for TransUnion to be able to participate in. \n Asia Pacific has also had a great rebound. We're seeing exciting things in the Philippines. We're very bullish about the potential for developing our franchise there. And LatAm is doing well, and we hope and expect to produce better results in Brazil. \n And look, in the U.K., the U.K. has been a tough slog. That economy has been through a lot. Inflation and interest rates have been very high. And we were probably overweighted there more toward short-term money lenders and fintech, which have had a particularly hard time in these past couple of years. \n Now that that's kind of flattening out, the robust growth we've been enjoying in kind of core mainstream banking is going to start to shine through as well as some of the diversifications into the gaming and gambling market in the U.K., which is quite well developed. Hopefully, I didn't leave anybody out as I went around the horn here, apologies. No offence intended, if I have. \n Look, international is rolling well and we expect to continue to post really good results this year."

            "name": "Todd Cello",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and let me add my welcome to everyone. Before I begin, I wanted to highlight our updated segment reporting. Starting this quarter, we are reporting our Consumer Interactive business within our U.S. market segment. Additionally, we have shifted certain revenue between U.S. financial services, U.S. emerging verticals and our International segment. These actions better align our reporting to how we run the business under our U.S. markets and international [ presidents ] . \n We have provided recast 2022 and 2023 quarterly results for the updated reporting in an 8-K filed on Tuesday and have posted the details to our Investor Relations website. Additionally, in the appendix of today's presentation, we have provided incremental vertical revenue mix disclosure for our U.S. financial services, U.S. emerging verticals and Consumer Interactive businesses for fiscal year 2023.  \n As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we exceeded our guidance on all key financial metrics. First quarter consolidated revenue increased 9% on a reported basis, and 8% on an organic constant currency basis. There was no impact from acquisitions and a less than 1% benefit from foreign currency.  \n Our business grew 5% on an organic constant currency basis, excluding mortgage from both the first quarter of 2023 and 2024. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11% on a reported and constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.1%, ahead of our expectations and up 80 basis points compared to the year ago quarter due to flow-through on revenue growth.  \n First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.92, an increase of 14%. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.5%. Finally, in the first quarter, we took $43 million of onetime charges related to the next phase of our transformation program, $24 million for operating model optimization and $19 million for technology transformation.  \n We continue to expect to incur roughly $200 million of onetime expenses in 2024, driving $65 million of in-year operating expense savings. As part of our $355 million to $375 million program, we expect the remaining $75 million to $95 million of onetime expenses to be incurred in 2025.  \n Looking at segment financial performance for the first quarter. U.S. markets revenue, which now includes Consumer Interactive, was up 7% compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for U.S. markets was up 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin was down 20 basis points to 36.2%.  \n Financial Services revenue grew 13% with trends broadly consistent with the levels seen in the fourth quarter. Excluding mortgage, Financial Services, revenue was up 1%. Consumer lending revenue returned to growth, up 2% in the quarter. Activity remained muted as fintechs and others remain cautious given rates and market uncertainty.  \n New customer and wallet share wins across fintech, buy now pay later, and short-term lenders offset some of the softness and contributed to growth. Our credit card and banking business was flat. While issuance is healthy on a historical basis, online and batch activity remains tempered as lenders manage rising delinquencies.  \n We are enabling our customers to navigate the current environment and position themselves for future growth with highly relevant products such as our TruVision Risk Solutions, TruIQ's analytical suite, Trusted Call Solutions and our TruValidate fraud offerings. Our auto business grew 2% despite continued headwinds in the auto market, driven by new business wins and growth from captive auto lenders.  \n Consumers, particularly near prime and subprime continue to face affordability challenges from higher interest rates and declining, but still high used car prices. Improved new vehicle inventory has provided some increased credit volume as well as interest from OEMs and dealers and noncredit solutions as they seek to acquire more customers.  \n We are seeing strong momentum selling Neustar marketing and Trusted Call Solutions into the auto space. For mortgage, revenue grew 52% against inquiry volume declines of 8%. Outperformance related to higher-than-expected price realization on third-party scores and credit products. Volumes were also slightly higher than our expectations, especially in prequalification.  \n Relative to prequalification volume, shopping activity has been healthy, and to date, we have not seen much incremental pressure from the extension of the GSE prequalification program. We are pleased with the strong mortgage growth in the quarter, but given uncertainty around interest rates, origination volumes an uptake of these newer prequalification programs, we continue to take a conservative view on our mortgage guidance for the year.  \n On a trailing 12-month basis, mortgage represented about 8% of total TransUnion revenue. Let me now turn to our emerging verticals, which grew 4% in the quarter. Insurance, media, public sector and collections led the way for growth.  Telecommunications in tech, retail and e-commerce grew modestly, while tenant and employment screening declined as expected.  \n Our appendix slide provides helpful detail on the relative sizing of each of these verticals. In Insurance, we delivered improved growth with market trends progressing as expected to start the year. Select underwriters are starting to resume marketing activity as rate adequacy improves, with broader recovery expected as the year progresses. Healthier backdrop supports credit-based marketing volume as well as increased demand for our suite of marketing products, such as identity-based data hygiene and targeted audience solutions.  \n Consumer shopping activity remains strong. We continue to deliver significant new business wins across our core products as well as with innovative products like TruVision driving history, successful cross-selling of Neustar and Sontiq solutions and penetration of the life and commercial insurance market.  \n Media, public sector and collections all grew double digits. Media benefited from marketing identity and audience wins and a stabilizing market backdrop. Public sector and collections were again powered by strong growth in Trusted Call Solutions, along with fraud volumes in the public sector.  \n Telco was up slightly in line with the recent trajectory and our growth expectation for the vertical, which includes many of our legacy communication solutions like landline caller ID. Tech, retail and e-commerce was also up modestly as it comped against project-based revenue in the prior year. Tenant and employment screening declined as expected as we work through the recalibration of our solutions. We expect better performance in the second half of the year as we lap the impact of these actions.  \n Turning to Consumer Interactive. Revenue decreased 2%. Our indirect channel grew benefiting from continued breach wins. Reach revenues can be uneven, but we are accelerating our pace of wins largely on the strength of Sontiq offerings. Our direct business declined as expected as we work through the impact of our recalibrated marketing strategy.  \n We are making good progress on broadening our value proposition and go-to-market strategy in this business. For my comments about International, all revenue growth comparisons will be in constant currency. For the total segment, revenue grew 15%, with 4 of our 6 reported markets growing by double digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 45.2%, up 230 basis points.  \n Now let's dig into the specifics for each region. In India, we grew 31%. We delivered growth across consumer credit, commercial credit, fraud, marketing and direct-to-consumer supported by strong market trends. In the U.K., revenue was flat. The U.K. fintech market remains subdued but has stabilized, and we continue to see solid growth in banking and insurance, setting us up for some improvement as the year progresses.  \n TruVision trended data, affordability-oriented solutions and our consumer offerings continue to drive new wins. Canadian business delivered another quarter of very strong performance, growing 18% despite a muted macro environment. We benefited from share gains in financial services, strong growth in telco and insurance, momentum in Consumer Indirect and recent breach wins.  \n Growth in Canada was also a bit better than anticipated due to healthier online volumes. Looking ahead, as we lap sizable new business wins, we expect growth in subsequent quarters to return to high single digits, which still represents market-leading performance in Canada.  \n In Latin America, revenue was up 7%. In Colombia and other Latin America countries, we delivered broad-based growth with stabilizing market conditions after a softer second half 2023. Brazil was flat after a few quarters of declines, and we expect further improvement as the year progresses. In Asia Pacific, we grew 17%, driven by very strong growth in the Philippines and another solid quarter in Hong Kong.  \n Finally, Africa increased 12% led by our retail and insurance verticals.  \n Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with roughly $5.3 billion of debt and $434 million of cash. We finished the quarter with a leverage ratio of 3.5x. You can find our debt profile in the appendix of our presentation. We did not make debt prepayments in the first quarter, but expect to make some prepayments over the course of 2024 with our excess free cash flow.  \n Our focus this year remains on executing against the transformation initiatives. We expect most of our $355 million to $375 million of onetime transformation expense to be paid out in 2024. Based on our expectation for adjusted EBITDA and cash generation, we expect our leverage ratio to be in the low 3x range by the end of 2024.  \n We continue to work toward our leverage ratio target of under 3x. We do not view 3x as an ending point for deleveraging and viewed debt prepayment as an attractive incremental use of our cash over the medium term. Turning to guidance. Even after a strong start to the year, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to assume muted economic growth throughout 2024 with steady lending volumes and no benefit from interest rate cuts.  \n That brings us to our outlook for the second quarter of 2024. We expect foreign exchange to have an insignificant impact on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to be between $1.017 billion and $1.026 billion or up 5% to 6% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis.  \n Our revenue guidance includes approximately 3 points of tailwind from mortgage.  Meaning that we expect the remainder of our business to grow 2% to 3% on an organic constant currency basis. We expect mortgage revenue growth in the second quarter to be slightly lower than the 52% we experienced in the first quarter.  \n We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $366 million and $372 million, up 8% to 10%. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin of 36.0% to 36.3% or up 90 to 120 basis points. We also expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $0.95 and $0.98, up 11% to 14%.  \n Turning to the full year. We expect insignificant impact from foreign exchange on revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We expect revenue to come in between $4.023 billion and $4.083 billion or up 5% to 6.5% on an as reported and organic constant currency basis.  \n Our increased guidance is driven entirely by mortgage, specifically from better-than-anticipated price realization on third-party scores and credit reports. 2024, our mortgage inquiry assumption is unchanged at down 5%. However, we now expect our mortgage revenue to increase about 50%, up from 25% prior. We now expect inquiries to be slightly better in the first half of the year, but still down 10% and for the second half volumes to be flat.  \n We expect our organic constant currency growth, excluding mortgage, to be up about 2% to 3.5%. We are pleased with our nonmortgage outperformance in the first quarter, but continue to take a deliberately conservative approach to the rest of the year, given continued market uncertainty.  \n For our business segments, we expect U.S. markets to grow mid-single digit or up low single digit, excluding mortgage. We now anticipate Financial Services to be up low double digit or low single-digit growth, excluding mortgage. We continue to expect emerging verticals to be up low single digit, and we expect Consumer Interactive to decline low single digit. We now anticipate that International will grow low double digit in constant currency terms driven by broad-based positive trends and led by India.  \n Turning back to the total company outlook. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $1.433 billion and $1.475 billion, up 7% to 10%. And would result in adjusted EBITDA margin being 35.6% to 36.1% or up 50 to 100 basis points. Anticipate adjusted diluted earnings per share to be $3.69 to $3.86, up 10% to 15%.  \n We expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 22.5%. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $530 million, and we expect the portion excluding step-up amortization from our 2012 change in control and subsequent acquisitions to be about $245 million. Anticipate net interest expense would be about $250 million for the full year, up $5 million from prior guidance due to higher SOFR. We expect capital expenditures to be about 9% of revenue.  \n And as previously noted, we continue to expect to incur $200 million in onetime charges in 2024 related to our transformation program. I'll now turn the time back to Chris for some final comments. Absolutely. So Faiza, thanks for the question. And one point that I want to start with, just to make certain that's clear to everyone is that TransUnion includes the prequalification volumes that Chris was just speaking about in our overall volumes. \n So when you see our volume number, that's including the [ prequal ].  So what that means when Chris was talking about shopping activity being better, you have to keep that in mind that that's, in essence, one of the drivers that we saw to keep the expectations on volumes a little bit better from what we had guided. \n So from there, if you look at our guidance back in February compared to what we put out this morning, starting with revenue, you'll notice that we've increased the revenue by 25%. So now we're expecting mortgage to grow 50% instead of 25%. But back to the volumes we are expecting volumes for the full year to remain the same at down 5%. \n Now in the first half, we are expecting the volumes to be a little bit better. Back in February, we had assumed a 15% decline. And now we are assuming a 10% decline. So in essence, you get a 5% pickup in the first half. Prequalification is a part of that. So keep that in mind. But then in the second half, if you go back to February, we were anticipating that we would grow 10% in our volumes. And that was just purely comparable. \n If you remember, the second half of 2023 was particularly weak. So what we've done is we've changed our second half assumption in essence, to be flat. So what that means is second half now has a decline of 10%. So what -- the reason that's important to call out is we are fully acknowledging the headwinds that we are experiencing in the market from a volume perspective with the 10-year treasury yield creeping up and 30-year mortgage rates higher. We are acknowledging that in our forecast. \n So the takeaway here is that this is just better price realization on third-party scores as well as reports. Thank you for the question. So to start off in response to that, I think what's important for everyone to remember that our initial guide back in February did not anticipate a benefit from lower interest rates. So we went into the year in essence, just very conservative. \n We didn't want to get ahead of ourselves and that proves to be a very good thing, right, as far as where interest rates appear to be headed. Trends in our core U.S. financial services business, I would say that they remain stable. You've heard from some of the bank earnings call, they used the words subdued. I think that we have appropriately captured these trends in our outlook. There's no significant upside contemplated there. It's more of a continuation of the trends that we're seeing. \n Some important reminders. TransUnion obviously, has a very diversified portfolio. And as a reminder, in 2022 and 2023, we grew 3% in both years. Now clearly, that's not what we planned for and that's not at all what we aspired for, but it shows the balance of the business, and that's intentional. So -- and with that also, we currently believe that interest rates perhaps may have peaked or maybe they won't go up much further. \n So what does that mean? Well, what it does is it drives certainty that didn't exist for our customers in the previous 2 years when interest rates were increasing in 2022 and 2023, our customers didn't know how much higher that they were going to go. So there's definitely some certainty there. \n Also, it's important to call out that our International business just continues to have strong momentum. In the February -- in our February guidance, we called for high single-digit growth from that business. We've increased that, even though we're maintaining in total. At the company level, we've increased to low double digits for International just based on this strong momentum that we're seeing in International. \n You flip back to the U.S. markets, the emerging verticals, it's important to call out there that many of those businesses are less dependent on interest rate movements. And this gets back to what I said at the beginning about the power of the diversified portfolio that we have. \n And I would say, we're seeing improving trends there. Nothing dramatic, but things are starting to get better. And then the last point I would make on this one is cutting across all of these businesses, TransUnion has a robust portfolio of solutions to help our customers no matter what the macro environment presents them."
