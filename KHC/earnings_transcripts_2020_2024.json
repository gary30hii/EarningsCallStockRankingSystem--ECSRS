At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Jakubik. Sir, you may begin.\nChris Jakubik: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our Q&A session today. As you know, during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. Before we begin, I do want to highlight that we will provide greater details on our 2021 initiatives during our presentation at the CAGNY conference this coming Tuesday. So today's session will be most productive if you limit yourself to one question and focus your questions on our results and the announcements that we have made today. With that, I'll hand it back to the operator, and we can start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nPaulo Basilio: Good morning, Andrew.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi there. So I guess for my question, I'd like to explore a bit your expectations for full-year 2021, really in terms of your planning stance for demand. I guess some companies have been more aggressive in terms of their expectations around return to normalization and the impact on consumption, others may be somewhat more conservative. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how KHC is thinking about this in its guidance or what end of the spectrum the company is on in thinking about this and how conservative or not your planning stance may be for 2021? Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Hi, Andrew, this is Miguel speaking. Well, we are looking at 2021 in a conservative way. We - but I have to say that we saw very strong consumption gains in January, and February is coming good as well. And if this persists at these types - at this level, we may have an upside in our results. But I think that with the environment so volatile, we better continue taking a quarter-by-quarter approach, which was the outlook that we gave you, and really concentrating our minds and our efforts on our transformation through our operating model. Paulo, I don't know if you have anything to add, but from my side...\nPaulo Basilio: No. That's it, Miguel. I think also it's worthy to comment that we are - in our outlook, we are including the view that we have for inflation. And also, we are not considering the two divestitures that we've announced.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thank you very much.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Your line is open. \nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just had a question, if I could. Have you defined the amount of inflation you expect for the year and then how you hope to overcome that? I suspect that\u2019s through a combination of pricing and promotional efficiencies. But I want to get a better sense of like the magnitude of the inflation. And I wondered if you could speak to that, excluding Planters and Cheese. I know those were kind of pass-along commodity-type categories, but just trying to think about the ongoing portfolio and the effect on the business overall this year?\nPaulo Basilio: Sure. Chris, this is Paulo here. So, we are seeing the same inflation. We're also seeing the inflation that you're seeing, and coming from non-commodities - non-key commodities, ingredients, especially packaging in transportation in the U.S. And we think that the level and the type of inflation that we are seeing, it's manageable, and it's in our outlook, as I mentioned. And we have two reasons that - behind that. The first one that, we are very confident on the supply chain efficiency programs that we have, that we'll expect to unlock savings across our supply chain. And the second is on our revenue management initiatives across the globe, that in combination with the innovation, renovation market investments that we're doing can help us with pricing, if we need. And as I said, we have incorporated this inflation in our outlooks today. I don't know if Carlos want to comment something on top of that.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: No. I think to reiterate your point, Paulo, that we feel that it's manageable. And I think that we are taking the appropriate revenue management initiatives to make sure that we can handle those things, as they come. Thank you.\nChris Growe: Just to be clear on that, is that mostly U.S.-based inflation? As I think about freight, in particular, it\u2019s more of a U.S. issue? Or is there kind of a wider rate of inflation across the portfolio? Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio : Yes. When you think about the commodities - the non-key commodities, ingredients and packaging across the globe, and think about the freight, the transportation is more focus in the U.S. And one thing also that you've mentioned, when you think about the key commodities, the big four commodities that we have, we are not really seeing a lot of year-over-year inflation through the year, okay, when you add all of them. So we were really talking about the non-key, non-big four commodities and packaging and transportation in the U.S.\nChris Growe: Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning. Just to stay on the subject of cost and pricing. A few years ago, some manufacturers tried to pass through some list prices because of higher transportation costs. I think some of their customers at that time, on the retail side, push back saying, \"Look, we'll give you some pricing when your ingredients go up.\" We've done that in the past, but kind of trucking is you're on your own. I would imagine that this time around, it's a little bit different. I just kind of wanted to get a sense for, given your higher costs in packaging, higher transportation and given the lack of elasticity, among consumers right now, how reluctant are some of your customers to allow you to take some pricing, whether it's on the list side or on fewer promo? I just wanted to get a sense for your relationship with them? And how much pushback you're getting on any kind of price increases you're trying to push through?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me - I'll take that one. Just to give you kind of a view in terms of the U.S. and what we're seeing with our customers. First, I would say is, well, we see - let me start with the consumer. Our consumer right now, as we have shifted towards being very much focused on understanding what they're going through and so forth. I think they're certainly showing quite an amount of resiliency through this process that we're going through. And I think for us, our focus is, how do we make sure we drive the renovation of our portfolio to make sure that we can continue to drive the right value for us as for the consumer. Now we're balancing that, too, with making sure that we have the right revenue management initiatives. And when I say that, I say, using the full availability of our tools in our toolbox to be able to kind of handle the different pressures that maybe coming at us because of inflation. So, the way I think about it is, our focus is driving that better value to consumers by making sure we are improving our portfolio, making sure we continue to invest behind the marketing and improving the quality of our media, and making sure that we are seeing how that actually translated in us driving our improvement in shares throughout, like we did in 2020. So at this point, I would say, these are things that we can manage. And we don't see that as a major derailer as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning. So, I guess, my question is just related to the divestitures. And maybe, Paulo, could you give us a sense of - I know we have a sense now of what the deleveraging impact will be. But could you give us a sense of maybe what the dilution would be to EBITDA or to earnings? And I guess trying to get underneath, not just EBITDA going out the door, but maybe the scope of stranded overhead, or is, there any other meaningful cost that we should be thinking about, as we're sort of trying to look at the model ex divestitures?\nPaulo Basilio: Sure. No. So when you look at this business, it's a business that has an average margin that is lower than the average - that has a margin that is lower than the average margin of the company. And we are really expecting minimal dilution from these divestitures, okay? And also - we are also working internally here from now until we close to try to even offset that. So I think what I could tell you today is exactly that, that it's a business with a margin below the average of the company and expecting minimal dilution. And I think we have time even for this minimal dilution to work internally to try to offset it.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And that's true for the cheese business as well? So when you look at both divestitures, we shouldn't expect a lot of earnings dilution from both of them?\nPaulo Basilio: When you look about the cheese divestitures, as I mentioned before, we were expecting around a 5% dilution. And - but again, the same way for these divestitures, we are also working now with this two business out of the company to limit this other - the dilution.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for sneaking me in. I appreciate it. I guess, I kind of want to come back to a similar question, but it's all about trying to determine where you're going to land on EBITDA for the year. Can you put a finer point on the comment that you made in your press release that you expect EBITDA to come in ahead of your strategic plan? What does it imply? Like where would your strategic plan place you? How much upside do you see? And back to Spillane's question, how much EBITDA is leaving with Planters and cheese, please? Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: So it's Paulo, again. So listen, we are not giving point estimations for our full-year 2021 EBITDA. But what we are conveying here is that we - as Miguel mentioned, we had very good start for 2021. I think we gave a good clarity on our Investor Day about the curve that we had for our EBITDA through our strat plan. And again, we are seeing an upside on that. And this upside is coming from - not only from at-home consumption that we are seeing coming from this COVID situations, but also from better performance that we have in the business - in many areas of the business, including supply chain. So that is how we are seeing that.  And again, of course, we're going to be lapping at a very strong 2020 performance, but we are very confident and how we are starting the year and the potential upside that we have. And we're very happy that we are seeing a stronger beginning of the year and a stronger potential performance for us in 2021. About the impact from divestitures, it's pretty much what I was mentioning the question before about, we expect pretty much from the Planters business a minimal dilution, and we are working internally to offsetting even this dilution, this is more dilution that we can see now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the cost picture, productivity savings and other things that might impact 2021 versus 2020. It sounded like you said that commodity costs would be fairly benign. But perhaps you can dig into that versus freight and logistics, where we've heard about some inflation and how that might net across against your productivity plans? Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: Paulo, you want to start on that one?\nPaulo Basilio: Sorry. Can you repeat the question? You cut here.\nDavid Palmer: Sure. A question on some of the gives and takes with regard to your margins and EBITDA for 2021.\nPaulo Basilio: Okay.\nDavid Palmer: You mentioned commodity costs were fairly benign. But I'm wondering if maybe you can put some expectations or quantify that a little bit more about your commodity outlook and also talk about freight and logistics. We've heard a good bit of inflation is out there on the shipping side. If you could maybe break that out or speak to that net of productivity plans for this year? Thanks.\nPaulo Basilio: Yes. As \u2013 yes, now that's clear. We are seeing the inflation as I was mentioning before, we are seeing the inflation. When you separate this, we see inflation coming from the same type of inflation that you're seeing. It's a broad inflation from non-key commodities and also packaging. And we also see inflation coming on the transportation in the U.S., okay? On the big four commodities that we have, we are not seeing any of inflation, okay? So it's more stable. And as I was mentioning, the type of inflation that we're seeing and the level that we are seeing, we believe is manageable through not only the supply chain initiatives that we have, but also with the revenue management initiatives that we were describing, Carlos was mentioning in a few questions ago. But again, we are seeing the inflation. We believe it's manageable and it's embedded in our outlook.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks.\nPaulo Basilio: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Your line is open.\nAlexia Howard: So you talked about the Taste Elevation platform doing very well, and you've got slide 7 to demonstrate that. Can you talk explicitly about exactly which products and which geographies are working best there and whether you expect that momentum to continue?\nMiguel Patricio: Well, actually, we are doing pretty well on Taste Elevation across the board, and there's not one specific country. Of course, that - since U.S. is so critical in our portfolio, U.S. is a big part of this growth. But I would mention Canada, U.K., Australia but even the emerging countries like Brazil, Russia, Middle-East we are doing very well in Taste Elevation. We are having record shares with our brand Heinz with ketchup and sauces everywhere in the world. But it's not only Heinz. We have line parents. We have Heinz Mayo. We have - basically, our portfolio - the entire portfolio on Taste Elevation doing very, very well, both growing volume and share.\nAlexia Howard: Do you expect that momentum to continue even as the pandemic eases?\nMiguel Patricio: I do. And I think that we have a pretty strong innovation plan ahead that will strengthen that performance. I think we have great momentum, and that will continue.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thanks very much.\nPaulo Basilio: Just to build Miguel's point, I think you're going to hear more about it when we go through our CAGNY discussions. But - because I think that this - our Taste Elevation has proven to be an advantaged part of our business, that will be something that we will continue to lever as we go forward. Thank you.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you, all.\nMiguel Patricio: And then just continue building on that. This is our true global platform, and we are benefiting from experiences and tests that we are doing in countries and leveraging and scaling it up in other countries much faster than we did in the past. We are working much better as a team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nMichael Lavery: You noted that your marketing spend was up 11% last year. Does that get you to where you think is about the right level? Or should we expect more investments there? And when you say, further prioritization efforts are underway, is that a reallocation of spending? Or does that mean just giving more money to the priority initiatives or a bit of both?\nMiguel Patricio: So we - in our strategic review, we talked about increasing 30% marketing in five years. So, last year we increased more than what would be the CAGR for five years, of course. This year, we are seeing great opportunities for us, on efficiencies in marketing. We are going - we are buying media in a much better way. We have a new contract with great savings on media. We are improving our creative and content. And really sweating the assets, and leveraging a better ROI. So I think that, things are in accordance to plan in marketing. And we are going to get better every year. And we are very excited with that. Carlos, I don't know if there's anything you want to add, but...\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: No, you covered it well. Thanks, Miguel.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Your line is open.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much for the question. What - I look at the Natural Cheese divestiture versus Planters, certainly some similarities around the challenges in differentiating the customer, but there's also some important differences. And I would love to know, what's the bright line within Planters? You listed some things, that make sense to make, but you have - where you decided it was maybe divest - something that wasn't a problem not worth trying to solve, relative to many other brands where you are having success, rethinking, reframing, driving the brand to success where maybe there hasn't been in the past. Just what were the attributes that really put you over the line, that this is something that's better in someone else's hands?\nMiguel Patricio: Look, Planters is a very iconic, very strong brand. So this is not something that we took lightly. But to improve our portfolio, we must focus on areas where we see the greatest competitive advantage, the greatest potential and returns. And when I - we look at the Planters, Planters is one of the brands that is most affected by private label, in our portfolio. It's also, of course, affected as a commodity. And so when we looked at that, in order to have more flexibility towards the future on building a portfolio, I think that we made that choice. And we are very happy with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche. Your line is open.\nSteve Powers: So I guess, two follow-ups on the Planters divestment, if I could. First is just the 15 times EBITDA multiple that you articulated on slide 22 of your deck today. I just want to clarify does that include overheads in the implied EBITDA base that will be stranded? I appreciate that you'll try to offset that, but just wanted to confirm. And then, strategically, I guess just to press a bit on Jonathan's question from a moment ago. Back in September, Real Food Snacking was something that you highlighted as a growth platform, and I'm assuming it still is. Planters, was part of that. And so, I appreciate and understand the rationale that you're articulating today around why Planters might not fit as well going forward, especially at the deal price that you've announced today. But what was - was there a strategic pivot? Was there something that happened between September and today aside from an offer coming in that changed your perspective on Planters? Because again, it was positioned as part of that growth platform five, six months ago. Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Okay. So let me get the first one here and then ask Carlos to take the second part of your question. So yes, when you look at the multiple that we disclosed that is like 15 times 2020 and 17 times 2019, it includes some small allocation of stranded costs, a small part of that. That - it includes in both numbers, okay, in the 17 times '19 and the 15 times 2020. I'm going to ask Carlos to get the second part of your question about the platform.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Thank you. And you're right. The idea of us focusing Real Food Snacking is something that we laid out in September, and we continue to be very much focused on driving that as part of our growth platform. And that - just want to be clear, that has not changed. I think today, you saw in the press release that we highlighted, there's still two specific areas within Real Food Snacking that we believe we have huge amount of advantages, and we're going to continue to drive those as we go forward.  Specifically, we think about real fuel for kids, where lunch both is a cornerstone of that particular area and segment as well as real meal alternative where we think about adult opportunities to substitute meals, things like what we see in areas like P3, for example.  So when I look at the entire strategy, I think it's for us, we continue to stay focused on Real Food Snacking. The transaction today is actually only going to help us add additional fuel to support the strategy that we laid out in September. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jenna Giannelli of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJenna Giannelli : Thank you so much for taking the question. In your prepared comments, you said that IG was important to you, but obviously, without sacrificing the speed of the transformation. I'm curious in your mind where the business and leverage needs to be in order to get to IG? And in your mind, what are the primary benefits of achieving that rating? Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Let me take this one. Listen, we believe investment grade, as I said, is important for the company. As we were mentioning also, we closed the year at 3.7 times. We want to be consistently before below 4 times net leverage in the organization. And this is - and we believe we are on track to get now to stay there - to stay - to get them stay below 4 times, even without the two divestitures that we've announced, okay?  The proceeds of these two additional divestitures would give us additional 0.5 turn of deleverage. And this would give us flexibility and I think that is important, flexibility to accelerate our strategy. And this acceleration would kind of like organically, inorganically with the initiatives that we are forming here. And again, that is the plan that we have today. We want to keep the leverage below four times, and we are on track to be there. I think the proceeds from the divestitures are going to give us additional flexibility to accelerate our strategy. And again, we are very comfortable with the path that we have in terms of deleveraging with our credit position. So, we are feeling very good on the capital structure and credit side.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Miguel Patricio for any closing remarks.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Well, I wanted to thank you all for being with us here. I just wanted to finish and say that we are - I couldn't be more optimistic and positive about the momentum that we have in the company right now. We are progressing fast in this transformation journey that we are. We have today a very different company that we had 12 months ago. We have a much better team. We have a far better employee morale and engagement despite the fact that we've been all working from home. We have the priorities in terms of strategy and geographies very well defined, so we have a north. We talked about efficiencies in the supply area, and we brought them, we executed them, despite the fact that we had the best year in quality and safety in our plants. We put back in marketing $100 million in 2020. And we are starting the year strong. Jan and Feb are strong months for us. We have new households with - getting better in market share every quarter. We have a very strong renovation and innovation that we are going to share with you better at CAGNY. Investment levels are ramping up. And from a financial standpoint, this transformation is well underway. We are on track to remain below four times leverage. The 2021 financials will be ahead of our strategic plan. And the divestures that we just announced will accelerate deleveraging, increasing flexibility for accretive investment. So we - one year ago, we had a lot of hopes and plans. I would say we are ahead of where we thought we could be. Thank you very much. Thank you for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all participating. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. No. That's it, Miguel. I think also it's worthy to comment that we are - in our outlook, we are including the view that we have for inflation. And also, we are not considering the two divestitures that we've announced. Sure. Chris, this is Paulo here. So, we are seeing the same inflation. We're also seeing the inflation that you're seeing, and coming from non-commodities - non-key commodities, ingredients, especially packaging in transportation in the U.S. And we think that the level and the type of inflation that we are seeing, it's manageable, and it's in our outlook, as I mentioned. And we have two reasons that - behind that. The first one that, we are very confident on the supply chain efficiency programs that we have, that we'll expect to unlock savings across our supply chain. And the second is on our revenue management initiatives across the globe, that in combination with the innovation, renovation market investments that we're doing can help us with pricing, if we need. And as I said, we have incorporated this inflation in our outlooks today. I don't know if Carlos want to comment something on top of that. Yes. When you think about the commodities - the non-key commodities, ingredients and packaging across the globe, and think about the freight, the transportation is more focus in the U.S. And one thing also that you've mentioned, when you think about the key commodities, the big four commodities that we have, we are not really seeing a lot of year-over-year inflation through the year, okay, when you add all of them. So we were really talking about the non-key, non-big four commodities and packaging and transportation in the U.S. Sure. No. So when you look at this business, it's a business that has an average margin that is lower than the average - that has a margin that is lower than the average margin of the company. And we are really expecting minimal dilution from these divestitures, okay? And also - we are also working internally here from now until we close to try to even offset that. So I think what I could tell you today is exactly that, that it's a business with a margin below the average of the company and expecting minimal dilution. And I think we have time even for this minimal dilution to work internally to try to offset it. When you look about the cheese divestitures, as I mentioned before, we were expecting around a 5% dilution. And - but again, the same way for these divestitures, we are also working now with this two business out of the company to limit this other - the dilution. So it's Paulo, again. So listen, we are not giving point estimations for our full-year 2021 EBITDA. But what we are conveying here is that we - as Miguel mentioned, we had very good start for 2021. I think we gave a good clarity on our Investor Day about the curve that we had for our EBITDA through our strat plan. And again, we are seeing an upside on that. And this upside is coming from - not only from at-home consumption that we are seeing coming from this COVID situations, but also from better performance that we have in the business - in many areas of the business, including supply chain. So that is how we are seeing that.  And again, of course, we're going to be lapping at a very strong 2020 performance, but we are very confident and how we are starting the year and the potential upside that we have. And we're very happy that we are seeing a stronger beginning of the year and a stronger potential performance for us in 2021. About the impact from divestitures, it's pretty much what I was mentioning the question before about, we expect pretty much from the Planters business a minimal dilution, and we are working internally to offsetting even this dilution, this is more dilution that we can see now. Sorry. Can you repeat the question? You cut here. Okay. Yes. As \u2013 yes, now that's clear. We are seeing the inflation as I was mentioning before, we are seeing the inflation. When you separate this, we see inflation coming from the same type of inflation that you're seeing. It's a broad inflation from non-key commodities and also packaging. And we also see inflation coming on the transportation in the U.S., okay? On the big four commodities that we have, we are not seeing any of inflation, okay? So it's more stable. And as I was mentioning, the type of inflation that we're seeing and the level that we are seeing, we believe is manageable through not only the supply chain initiatives that we have, but also with the revenue management initiatives that we were describing, Carlos was mentioning in a few questions ago. But again, we are seeing the inflation. We believe it's manageable and it's embedded in our outlook. Welcome. Just to build Miguel's point, I think you're going to hear more about it when we go through our CAGNY discussions. But - because I think that this - our Taste Elevation has proven to be an advantaged part of our business, that will be something that we will continue to lever as we go forward. Thank you. Okay. So let me get the first one here and then ask Carlos to take the second part of your question. So yes, when you look at the multiple that we disclosed that is like 15 times 2020 and 17 times 2019, it includes some small allocation of stranded costs, a small part of that. That - it includes in both numbers, okay, in the 17 times '19 and the 15 times 2020. I'm going to ask Carlos to get the second part of your question about the platform. Let me take this one. Listen, we believe investment grade, as I said, is important for the company. As we were mentioning also, we closed the year at 3.7 times. We want to be consistently before below 4 times net leverage in the organization. And this is - and we believe we are on track to get now to stay there - to stay - to get them stay below 4 times, even without the two divestitures that we've announced, okay?  The proceeds of these two additional divestitures would give us additional 0.5 turn of deleverage. And this would give us flexibility and I think that is important, flexibility to accelerate our strategy. And this acceleration would kind of like organically, inorganically with the initiatives that we are forming here. And again, that is the plan that we have today. We want to keep the leverage below four times, and we are on track to be there. I think the proceeds from the divestitures are going to give us additional flexibility to accelerate our strategy. And again, we are very comfortable with the path that we have in terms of deleveraging with our credit position. So, we are feeling very good on the capital structure and credit side."

I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.\nChris Jakubik: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our earnings call. As you know during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC.  We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. We will begin today's call with Miguel Patricio, our CEO providing a brief business update. Carlos Abrams-Rivera will then review performance in our U.S. business. Paulo Basilio, our CFO will discuss our financial performance and near term outlook, then we will all be available to take your questions.  With that, I'll hand it to Miguel.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you Chris. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start our business update by sharing the sentiment I provided earlier today in our earnings release. You have heard me say frequently that we were cautiously optimistic about the path forward. But our momentum has been building, causing us to turn more confidently optimistic. This is based on three facts. First, in the previous two quarters, our results benefited from the scale that Kraft Heinz could bring in the immediate response to the pandemic. Our exceptionally strong third quarter performance reflects the agility of our organization and our ability to sustain momentum. Second, the changes in consumer priorities continue to support greater at home consumption and increased demand for our brands. And third, our strategic work is moving from planning and organizing into action. Based on these three factors, we are raising our 2020 outlook and continue to expect 2021 results to be ahead of the strategic plan we finalized earlier this year.  To better make these points. Let me share a few relevant charts. Slide 6 presents an updated view of our at home or retail versus away from home or food service sales performance. The charts show Kraft Heinz's year on year sales growth by geography from Q1 through Q3. The abrupt and unprecedented shifting between at home and away from home consumption that we saw in the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. At our Investor Day, we spoke at length about the many things we have been doing to become more creative, more agile and more efficient. And despite both volatile demands, and in some areas constrained capacity, our teams around the world are demonstrating their ability to adapt to demand through a mindset of growth. Our agility led to a very strong second half of September, as retail demand accelerated yet again, and we responded effectively and efficiently. As a result, our Q3 top and bottom line performance was stronger that's what we projected at our Investor Day on September 15. We have talked about 2020 being the first year of a turnaround. We said, it would be a year in which we laid the foundation for future growth, stabilized our underlying profitability and maintain our industry leading margins, all while we rebuilt our business momentum. It is clear that this is happening, as you can see on slide seven. From the first half through the third quarter, we have sustained underlying top and bottom line moment. Even as we take on additional COVID related costs and supply constraints, we have been keeping our cost of goods under control. Also as we outlined in February, we are resetting our base through divestiture, business exit and the normalization of incentive compensation. Our underlying growth is tracking with our strategy. Platform growth is consistent with the portfolio rolls we have defined with grow platforms up 7% year-to-date and energize platforms up 8%. And what we find very encouraging is that, while taste elevation is growing middle single-digits, excluding food service, taste elevation is growing roughly 20%.  Emerging markets growth is accelerating, up 9% in Q3 versus 7% year-to-date. The simplification that our platform approach and portfolio rolls bring is a key enabler in guiding us and measuring our success as we move through off fence. This visibility is critical as consumers preferences evolve and we need to adapt to serve different needs. Which brings me to another reason for our confidence in our past going forward. We are seeing consumer preferences evolve in ways that indicates that elevated demand for both at home consumption and big trusted brands will remain strong going forward. We are seeing stickiness in at home consumption, as consumers discover or rediscover cooking at home and at home meal experience.  We see them reassessing the shopping trip. With bigger baskets and greater bundling, affordability is the rising concern which should be a benefit to those companies that are fast to adapt and have a strong presence up and down the price value ladder. Consumers are gravitating towards big brands and our retail partners are reassessing assortment with availability and velocity, a key determinant for it.  And consumers are increasingly choosing brands that can better align with their values. These consumer trends are tailwinds, causing us to turn more confidently optimistic in the near term. The actions we have already taken to put our operating model in motion and the things that we needed to fix the most heading to our turnaround are many of the same things needed to adapt to an unpredictable environment with faster, greater changes in the consumer demand. For instance, since late last year, we focused on improving our people efforts by revamping and deploying new training and development programs. In many ways, we were also ahead of the game in our efforts to reduce stress and burn out and boost moral [ph]. And just last week, Kraft Heinz was named to the top quartile of Forbes Magazine list of World's Best Employers, after not even making the list of 750 companies last year. This is very positive reinforcement for all our efforts. We have talked our plans about the many things as a way to transform our company, from adapting our innovation pipeline to eliminating waste, to driving productivity as well as better planning with our partners, and ramping up investments in our brands, and our capacity, and our reach ecommerce and emerging markets. The point is that we now have the framework and visibility to distort resources, reverse savings, where we have the most advantage, and the greatest opportunities to grow. And most important, we are moving from planning and organizing to action.  I will close my opening comments by summarizing a few points. We had stronger than expected Q3 results due to the greater agility we are creating. The consumer trends we are seeing and the actions under way give us more confidence that our momentum will remain strong in the near-term. And we expect to continue exceeding our regional strategic plan into 2021.  I will pass it on to Carlos now to provide more color on how we are seeing this taking shape in our biggest business. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Miguel and good morning everyone. I think that analogy I will use to describe this past quarter is that we successfully have been driving down the road at 90 miles per hour to keep up with all the demand while we are changing the tires. Now that takes ownership and agility and our teams are showing it in speed.  As Miguel mentioned, our third quarter results demonstrate our new organization quickly adapt to opportunities, and it was evident across our U.S. business as we finish out the quarter. As you can see on Slide 12, we maintain a strong momentum in both the top and bottom line. Organic net sales growth reflected higher household penetration and repeat rates and a revenue management discipline. An outstanding execution and efficiency in operations and procurement resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA gain, even as a number of headwinds began to have a greater impact in Q3.  With this, while demand shifted between channels on a week to week basis and the organization advanced the divestiture of our natural cheese business. While we can\u2019t predict the future three things give us further cause for concern, as Miguel mentioned, we are encouraged by the continuing trend to our greater at home consumption. Second is that we are seeing more consumers coming back to our brands. And third, we are now better positioned to retain and grow both new and loyal consumers respond to rapidly changing demand and further capitalize on the gains we have made in the last nine months. Keeping with a driving analogy, operationally, we have turned a corner. I am pleased to share that we have rapidly moved from reorganizing to execution. And we are now in position to properly deploy resources and execute in a way that continues to build on the positive consumption trends we're experiencing. To give you a better idea of what this means. In people, our new business unit structure is now fully operational and fully staffed. We have made recent external leadership additions in consumer insights and sales leads with major customers. These additions complement several internal placements in new or evolve critical role. All helping to carry out a new foundation of processes with a growth mindset. The work we have done to put people first is paying off. We have seen higher engagement among our current employees. And we are continuing to attract top tier talent into the organization more rapidly than ever before. And we're building and strengthening both organizational and individual capabilities. This includes leveraging digital as an enabler, which will allow us to accelerate our growth and raise the bar on what it means to be a better. Turning to our platforms. Significant work on all six platforms is underway in the U.S. zone. And what results will be more evident in 2021. I'll show in a moment that we have already stored resources and investment to fuel our grow and energize platforms. In our ops centers, collaboration across our entire supply chain contribute a significant amount to our success this quarter. Including holding cost of goods under control. Even with incremental COVID driven cuts, demand volatility and supply constraint. In addition, our focus on operational excellence in manufacturing has enabled us to increase year-over-year production in the low single digit range overall, and by roughly 20% on lines where we have constrained supply relative to strong demand. In Q3, this include relieving constraints in high demand categories like cocas, cream cheese, mac and cheese and stuffing, helping us to sustain already strong household penetration and share trends, which I'll talk about shortly. And anticipating continue demand, we expect to go from double to triple digit investment dollars to improve capacity in 2021. We've also made significant progress in our partner program, with customer citing much earlier and much deeper planning than in the past. To date, we have conducted more than 40 top-to-top meetings with key retailers with another 40-planned in the coming weeks. In each meeting, we are sharing our transformational plans as well a joint business plans for the coming year. It's allowing us to be more strategic in category development and value creation. And while we're doing a lot to maintain retail momentum, we're also finding opportunities to better support our food service partners. From piloting new innovations like steel-touch dispensers to helping create unique menu items to drive traffic and sales for our partners. We have quickly be with it to adapt to market needs. All of this is beginning to result in consumers voting more often for us. As you can see on Slide 14, our retail market share has been continuously improving over the past year, running up to the end of September. This has been driven by an improvement in the overall health of the portfolio. As we have had increased capacity, invested in marketing, adapted our communication and built stronger collaborations with our customers. The percent of our retail sales where we grow and share has gone from only 20% in the first half to 41% in Q3 and up to 58% in September. And we are fixing our biggest categories. As the percent of our categories where we are gaining share has gone from 36% to 49% over the same time period. Some of this is due to resolving supply constraint in some key categories. For instance, Oscar Mayer cocas, part of our fast fresh meals platform and an area we are energizing saw share growth this quarter for the first time in 18-months. This was the result of fast adapting a product mix to raw materials availability, and capacity constraints, as well as the agility to activate and execute differently with customers. Some of this is due to greater focus and prioritization that our platform approach is bringing. For instance, in our taste elevation platform, we grew market share during Q3 in over 70% of the categories we compete. More importantly, we are well positioned and have the right plans in place to build them. I have shown previously that our household penetration is one of the inherited strength of our portfolio relative to the industry. And how this has strengthened further since the onset of COVID-19. We continue to see increase household penetration and repeat rates across a sizable portion of their portfolio, including core brands, like Kraft Mac and Cheese, Philadelphia and Planters. But what is most encouraging is the rate of new buyer repurchasing our products two or more time, we've now doubled the rate versus what we\u2019ve seen last year. To build our base of loyal consumers and keep this momentum going, we are stepping up our marketing investment by 40% in the second half of this year, compared with the second half last year, and 70% compared with the first half of this year. We will have more work in dollars as a percent of our span as well. To close here, our third quarter was very encouraging as we began to see ourselves bringing agility to our scale. And with our organization prioritization and 2021 plans in place. We are well positioned to sustain the momentum we have benefited from so far in 2020.  With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to talk through our financial results and outlook. \nPaulo Basilio: Thank you, Carlos. And good morning everyone. I will quickly walk through some key highlights of our results and then provide our expectations for the plans forward. I will begin where Carlos left off with the US business. Organic net sales in the US increased 7.4% in spite of a roughly 1 point drag from the Mac FX [ph] which began July 1. Volume mix growth across retail, e-commerce and club channels was strong and more than offset lower food services sales. Pricing was up 4% from a combination of lower promotional activity in certain categories to protect customer service, selective blend price actions and commodity driven pricing primarily in cheese. These effects are expected to fade in Q4 as we begin to wrap prior year pricing actions. And we expect to return to more normal levels of promotional activity. At adjusted EBITDA even though we saw the key headwinds mentioned on our last earnings call, better retail performance, positive pricing, favorable mix, and strong procurement deficiencies more than offset those impacts. In our international segment, Q3 top-line performance, check three of the boxes of the strategy we outlined [indiscernible] at Investor Day. First, we delivered the mid-single digit growth with a relatively balanced contribution from volume and price. Second, growth was led by emerging markets with outside gains in priority markets, including Russia, Brazil and in taste elevation in China. And finally, we advanced our aspiration of global leadership in taste elevation with over 1 of share growth in that part. Taking together, this top-line growth fuelled 6.8% constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and more than offset higher supply chain costs, including incremental COVID-related expenses, and normalized incentive compensation. Looking forward, our outlook for the International segment is largely consistent with what we expressed in July. We anticipate results specifically on the top-line to soften in the remainder of the year compared to the year-to-date trend. Finally, in Canada, Q3 organic net sales growth decelerated relative to the first half. Here, lower coffee and food sub-shipments more than offset pricing gains and strong platform growth. In fact, Q3 retail consumption for easy meals made better in taste elevation, our two priority consumer platforms in Canada, grew at a double-digit rate and we increased share in 70% of all categories. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially, as we fully lapsed the divestiture of the Canadian, which is built in Q3. That said, we still saw declines versus prior year due to the Mac FX. Excluding the Mac FX impact, constant currency adjusted EBITDA would have been virtually flat with the prior year as consumption growth offsets supply chain cost inflation mainly logistics, as well as high incentive compensation. For Q4, we expect a combination of softer food services sales this year in seasonally strong Mac FX sales in the prior year to weigh on organic sales. These effects are likely to mask strong, although moderating retail consumption growth in carry forward price initiatives. EBITDA is likely to be more resilient and remain near run-rate margin levels with positive pricing and favorable mix more or less offsetting higher operational costs. Looking at the total company results, there are two things I'd like to highlight before going to our outlook. One is the low EBITDA items and the other is free cash flow. In July, we reiterated our prior forecast for $0.38 below the line headwinds due to a combination of higher tax, lower other income and higher equity compensation. Those three factors played out mostly as expected in Q3 with $0.12 negative impacts to adjusted EPS. That brought the year-to-date impact to $0.31 and remains in line with an approximate impact of $0.38 for the full year, a few item rank the rating today. Also keep in mind, that this impact is primarily non-cash in nature. In terms of free cash flow, year-to-date 2020 free cash flow has more than doubled compared with the first nine months of 2019. Much of the increase has been driven by year-to-date sales and adjusted EBITDA growth. However some of it is also due to favorable approval timing and lower CapEx spend which we expect to reverse in Q4. Furthermore, working capital as a source of cash should be comparatively less than it was in Q4 last year as we aim to reduce inventory levels.  That said, we are confident that free cash flow will be significantly better than 2019 levels. And we would expect free cash flow conversion to be roughly in line with our long term target of a 100% for the full year in 2020. Given where we are in the year and based on what you have been seen to-date, we are raising our outlook for Q4 and for the full year. We now expect organic net sales to grow mid-single-digits in Q4, as that would result in mid-single-digit growth for the full year. For adjusted EBITDA, we see high single-digit constant currency growth in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we are now expecting high single-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. In terms of cash flow and leverage, we expect the strong performance to-date to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion for the year and net leverage to be approximately four times by the end of the year. Looking into 2021, we now have things in place to accelerate our investment with a strong visibility on returns and built on the momentum we established this year.  It is difficult to predict consumer behavior and the balance between at home versus away from home consumption going forward. So we will focus on what we do control, in fact our objectives are proper. From an organic sales perspective, our focus will be to retain and develop market household gains we made in 2020, and improve our growth trajectory from agile portfolio management. For EBITDA, we will accelerate the growth investments especially towards emerging markets and deliver adjusted EBITDA above our strategic plan. We continue to be committed to a strong return of cash to shareholders and we will continue to reduce gross debt outstanding, accelerated by the proceeds of the pending Cheese transaction.  With that, let me turn it back to Miguel to close.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you Paolo. To quickly summarize what we have seen and what we see going forward, our momentum remains strong as we rebuild our company through a mindset of growth. We are now moving to offense, able to reinvest savings and realize near-term upside in a purposeful prioritized way. And we expect to continue performing ahead of our strategic plan.  Now, we would be happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan.\nKen Goldman: Hey, good morning. You mentioned affordability as an increasing concern for consumers but, at the same time that that's happening we're seeing private label across almost all categories do quite poorly in terms of share. I'm just curious you have some exposure to store brands in your categories, what is your research recently telling you about maybe why private label isn\u2019t doing a little bit better in this environment?\nMiguel Patricio: Well, let me start that and then [indiscernible]. We haven\u2019t really felt the effect of the crisis that we have. So that is ex-GDP. We continue to see a pretty big acceleration in consumption. And of course part of that is; number one, because of how consumption growing because of the pandemic. But number two, because of consumers going back to first the brand. I think that at this moment, there's a big need for brands that people trust. That's a big trend from the past, there was a need of experimentation of brands and other things. What we see at this moment related to affordability is a change towards the fact. So we are selling more [indiscernible] than we were before. So mix impact. Carlos you've got to complement if you have?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes, Miguel. So, I guess let me just go back to something that I said during Investor Day, which is not so much about fighting with private label as it is co-existing with private label. I think at this time, what consumers are looking from us is to make sure we continue to emphasize the value that we can bring. And we certainly do that with our brands. If you think about all the recessions, big brands tend to win as well as some of the private label. But then smaller brands actually do not perform as well. And I think that's playing out that way. So, if you look at our Q3 results, our shares actually improved throughout the quarter. And as we go into Q4, we can continue to invest behind our marketing. We've seen that continuing in the next quarter as well. \nMiguel Patricio: Thank you. \nKen Goldman: Thanks. Can I have just quick follow up to Paulo, just a clarification? You said you expect to reduce gross debt next year. Is there anything we should read into that that you said gross and not net debt? Do you also expect, I guess, to have your net debt lower at the end of '21 than it is at the end of 2020?\nPaulo Basilio: Yes, I made that list. And we are generating cash. As we said, we have a very strong cash generation this year, you have to pay down pretty much more than $1 billion in debt already. And just to say that we intend to keep paying down debt next year with a strong cash flow that this company here generates. But the dimension was pretty much to say that you're going to use, you're going to be paying down that every year to focus on the gross debt reduction. And of course, as you generate cash, our net debt also will go down.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody. Carlos, we've noticed you've obviously brought on quite a bit of new talent at high levels in a number of areas, but perhaps most visibly in sales. Having recently hired a new Head of US Sales and National Accounts. And I'm sure some others that I'm missing. Maybe you can talk a little bit in terms of what skill sets you were looking for when you brought some of these folks on. And some of the other efforts you've been making, specifically on the sales side. And maybe what you're seeing as far as a result, especially with key retail partners, which I know has certainly been an area of focus for the company?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Andrew, and we do appreciate you recognizing the changes we're making. And let me start with giving you a little bit of context about how we rethinking our sales organization. And for us, it was around how do we actually build agility in the organization and in three different pieces? How do we reorganize our structure, upgrading our processes and really stalling grid discipline and how we spend? So, I mean I think you speak about the reorganization we have made. We have brought new talent, and I think what I'm most proud of is the huge amount of experience and diversity of thinking that we're also bringing into Kraft Heinz. And we're also making sure we are changing how our account structure so that we can focus on those critical partners. And then internally, we have also centralized our customer development and revenue management teams to make sure we really leverage our scale in a different way. So, as you said, some of the key times we have not only a new Head of Sales, but people under him actually account for over 50% of our overall sales in the US. So, that is a significant new leadership that we have put into critical places. And then as we work with our customers, I'll tell you that one of the things that they also think to be noticing is that we have also upgraded our processes. So we are pulling forward planning cycle to make sure we better match their timelines, which something that we haven't done in the past. And then making sure we have that greatest discipline that I spoke about, which is, make sure we have clear planning timelines that we commit and deliver. And we have the clarity to drive accountability and speed internally.  And if you take a step back, Andrew, I think what you see is that that kind of improved execution is showing up both in terms of our growth, as well as the sequential improvement we're seeing in market share.  So, I am very pleased with the talent that we bring in the organization, again with the discipline, with the experience, and the diversity of thinking that I think is going to continue to make us a stronger company as we go forward. Thank you. \nAndrew Lazar: Thanks for that. Just a quick follow up then would be. You've talked a lot about bringing on additional capacity, particularly in some categories where you've been most constrained. Is there any way to dimensionalize, maybe what percentage of that capacity is third party manufacturers versus putting more of your own capital in the ground? And the reason I asked that is to try and get a sense of that that could be also a total on sort of your expectations around how much of this incremental demand could really be sticky by putting more of your own capital in versus flexibility of a copacker? Thanks so much.\nMiguel Patricio: No, thank you. And thanks for the question. So, I think the way I think about in terms of capacity is there are some pockets of capacity constraints, but really nothing that should be holding us back in a significant way. We have been making significant strides on improving our capacity in those lines that we have constrained. I think you have to talk about the fact that in those constraints line, we've actually driving 20% more out of those lines that we have ever done. So, it's also both making sure that we address that. But also is that we are also more agile to making sure we put the capacity that we have where we need it and working with our customers in collaborative way.  And some of that agility that also translates on how we actually working with our partners differently. Because we know that for example, let me just take one, which is Mac & Cheese. Well Mac & Cheese really the only constraint we have within Mac & Cheese cups. So what we have done is work collaborative with our retail partners, so that we can actually flex our marketing and promotion so that we can emphasize our box Mac & Cheese. And that kind of segmentation and focusing with our partners into the places where we do have a lot of capacity that actually has worked well. And it also is part of the reason why you're seeing that translating to improved share performance.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. A couple of questions. The first is on the market share improvements. It looks pretty impressive. Can you give a little more color on what categories are improving the most? And maybe explain what you did so that we can feel comfortable that those shares are sticky? Was it product? Was it pricing what's fixed?  And then secondly on inventory and supply chain. Glad to see that you're accelerating everything. Are retailers asking for more inventory than normal though? And when you say that the environment will go back to normal in fourth quarter, maybe a little more color on the -- as infection rates are rising higher, do you actually have to expand capacity well beyond your normal situation in order to satisfy what retailers want? Thanks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: If I can take that one at least for the U.S., and then if there's anything else, Miguel, you want to come in for performance on share. What I will say is that if you look at the way we're now thinking about our business. We\u2019re looking at how we go from 55 categories to the six platforms that we identified during Investor Day. I think the thing that is very encouraging for us is that we are seeing strong performance across all six growth platforms. Particularly the two areas we designated as growth platform around taste, elevation and easy meals made better. Those are adding really strong penetration rates. So, it is not only the fact that we are driving, improved share, but also is that we actually continue to drive the penetration in the places we really are going after. And that is done because of the work that we're doing. So for example, there are things we're doing taste elevation. And let me take the example the Heinz brand, we are benefiting as we are actually focused on those co-schools that we identified during our Investor Day, whether that was burgers and fries and nuggets, and those locations are actually driving even higher.  So, the places that we said that we're going to be focusing on are actually the behavior that we've seen consumers actually doing more of as we go into this in most recent quarters. And then if you look at things like eating meals made better, we have areas like mac and cheese. We also seen how they continued to come back as they are now understanding how good the product is. How they're doing more prepared meals at home, whether that is with mac and cheese, or with our classical plasticizer, or either potatoes. So, it's a combination of us improving on the way we think about our consumers with a stronger focus on the consumer platform, as well as continue to drive improved focus on our penetration of our brands and driving with better marketing.  Before I get to your questions about the overall inventory levels, I don\u2019t know Miguel anything else you wanted to comment in terms of share. \nMiguel Patricio: Yes. I complementing what you said. He means the national the International zones, we are seeing stable for [indiscernible]. The most remarkable growth is coming from Brazil, from Russia, and from the Middle East. In Canada, we are actually gaining share in 70% of the categories that we operate. We have problems with coffee, especially because of Mac FX. That is not in the face and that\u2019s very representative for Canada. It was about 5% of the net sales for business in Canada. But generally, this will no longer be in the base. So, that complements the great momentum we have in US [indiscernible] things in reference in some of our products [indiscernible] very good momentum. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Miguel. And then Rob, I think the other part of your question was around the inventory levels. I think that what we -- let me just -- I guess, put it within the context first of all, we saw in Q3, which is we did see some rebuilding of retail inventories, when you look at year-over-year. But that would really as a result of the drill down that we saw in Q1. So, it does vary by customer. But overall, I think we are seeing that progression of most of that recovery happen for what we saw in Q1. Now, the reality is that, we don't know what the precision is of where retailer are going to end up in terms of the number of days of inventory they're going to be carrying as we go forward. So that still to be known. What we -- what I can tell you we're doing is we actually working very collaborative with our customers to make sure that as they are preparing for a holiday season that I think in many ways would be unprecedented.  And then secondly is in places where we know that our consumers are looking to expand maybe into non-traditional categories. So we are seeing things like in our mid-business that actually recover in Q3 and we saw the improvement in share with some of the mid-business that normally wouldn't sell as much in Q4, we've seen already the improved performance in consumption as we go into the holiday so.  So net-net I will tell you is that we are working collaborative. We are seeing some improvement in Q3 in terms of retail inventories. Where exactly it's going to land? Not as clear yet. But we're going to be there with our customers to make sure we do the right thing.\nRobert Moskow: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess I wanted to follow up a little bit on Andrew Lazard\u2019s question, just with regards to the capacity additions and kind of the implications for I guess for I guess the stickiness of some of the elevated demand is here. My impression from the investor day was that the baseline expectation that you all were setting going forward was really that you weren't expecting a lot of this extra demand that that we picked up in 2020? So, I guess my question is, it sounds like you're expecting more of it to stick. So, maybe what's changed with regard to your thoughts around that? First. And then second, just give us a sense of how you're monitoring that? How do you identify that? And then maybe tied to that just how you plan? What do you do to maintain that stickiness? Is it increased advertising? Is it new products? Just what can you do to make sure that that demand is there? Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: We know we talked about it a bit, tried to give you a maybe a little more color in terms of how we think about our demand, and making sure that that it does stick. We do see, and we saw this in Q3 with consumers coming back to our brands in a much stronger way.  So the fact is that when you look at the results, we're really encouraged about the rate of new buyer repurchasing a product that it's two or more times. So, it's know that they're coming back, but they're actually coming at a higher rate than we have seen in the past. And we are also seeing that, particularly in a big brands. So, let me give an example of Philadelphia, the repeat is up 23%, as users really are looking for more user location, what to do with whether that is not just baking, but actually breakfast as well.  And we're seeing places like Oscar Mayer, where people are preparing more at home lunches and they're using our products in new occasions now that they are spending more time at home. So if you take it all together, then you say, okay. First, our big brands that really resonated with those new consumers. Those consumers are actually now that they are trying our brands are seeing the great taste, quality and value advantage that we bring. So, they're actually coming back at a higher rate. And when you can bring it all together, it just shows that, to me that the best way to exemplify this is that you see in the sequential improvement that we're seeing in our share performance.  So, that gives us quite a bit of confidence. I spoke earlier around, the capacity. And I can say again, we have seen pockets, but at the same time there's nothing that should be hidden in a significant way as we go forward. And I'm very pleased with that [indiscernible] this organization is doing in order to make sure that we work collaborative with our customers to ensure that, we have flex where we need it. But that actually has been something that we feel positive about as we go forward into Q4. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay?\nMiguel Patricio: Yes. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. \nAlexia Howard: Right. So, can I asked about the pricing dynamics? You talked about obviously, there was strength in pricing this quarter, particularly in the US. But do you expect that to save going forward as promotional activity start to ramp up again? I'm just curious about the conversations you're having with retailers about. Are they dropped off for more promotional activity? And in a capacity constrained environment. How are those conversations going? And then I have a follow up. \nPaulo Basilio: I can't take this one Alexia. I think I'm going to start here talking about like the comment about the pricing. And then maybe ask Carlos to talk to get the USPS I think is the good way to approach that. One thing that we see is that, as we comment, the first thing in Q4, we are going to start lapping some price increases we had in Q4 last year. So that is one of the components that we mentioned. So, in a relative basis. So, we're going to start lapping this price. And again, given the constraints that we had, and I'm going to ask Carlos to complement there, we are also coming back to a better or a more normal level of promotions. But then I'm going to ask Carlos to build on that.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes, thank you Paulo. In the U.S., what I will say is that we're beginning to now return to more normal levels of promotion and activity. I think you saw effect some of that already at Labor Day time period. And if you look at not only the actual Labor Day weekend but also overall, you take a step back and look at back to school performance. That back to school was actually pretty in line to what we saw last year. So that shows, I think that we are returning back that our customers want to make sure that we have the right pricing as we go into the remaining of the year.  So it was both in terms of us seeing that, we are ready in terms of having an availability of capacity to make sure we have the right promotions back in place, as well as working with our customers to make sure that we're there when we know consumers are going to be looking for our brands regardless of the channel whether that is in brick and mortar or ecommerce. And again, I think that -- if you look at it again, you see, just to finish the thought there is that. What you see is the market share performance, I think will show that kind of returning to promotions at the right level that we're doing as we go back and have the availability and the right investment with our customers.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And just a follow-up on the emerging market is obviously strong right now. But should we be worried about macro-economic slowdowns in those regions? And that may be starting to slow down demand for branded product?\nMiguel Patricio: Well, we are not in that. We have great momentum in emerging markets. And I don't see any reason to think that these will change in the short-term any signs of that. Actually, some countries go heavy record sales like [indiscernible]. We believe like in Brazil, the momentum is [indiscernible]. \nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much. Just one question. I guess, a lot of retailers have talked about SKU reductions and a more efficient supply chain. That was clearly a response to the supply chain constraints brought on by COVID. But I'm curious how do you think this will play out over the next 12 months? Do you think more SKUs and items come back? And the old complexity we had comes back? Or do you think that we wind up with a more efficient business model? And to what impact on margins, if any or your retailer relationships you looked at holistically? Thanks very much.\nMiguel Patricio: I can't answer that. And Carlos if you want to compliment that specifically about work. I think it's actually both. I think that the first moment to maximize capacity, what we use and that market use was to reduce dramatically the number of SKUs to maximize productivity in the short-term. Some of these SKUs, however we're renounced. And -- because they are important, they are incremental. And so I think in a way, the market is adopting, it went to one extreme. And now it's coming back. But of course, it will not go to the level that was before and that is good. It's good for us, because the complexity in our effectiveness, and make us really do a very good analysis on profitability and velocity and streamlines unnecessary SKU. Carlos, if you want to add anything?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Just to build more than in branding adding, I would say building U.S. meal. What I would say is that -- well, it's difficult to say how the customers are going to stay in terms of levels of inventory and SKU levels. There are things that we are doing internally to make sure that we have the most agile supply chain organization. And that includes us reducing the number of SKUs as we go into next year. So from what we had a year ago, to what you'll see in 2021 is about down 20% of number of SKUs. That actually is something that as we work collaborative with our customer shows that we\u2019re able to then make sure that we respond with the type of service they need in the core SKUs that they\u2019re also looking for. So, now that doesn\u2019t take away from us being able to also stay focused in the kind of innovation that we want to bring. So we are doing both reducing our SKUs by 20%, to make sure we have that gilt in our supply chain. At the same time, we also are still focused on innovation as we go into 2021 in which we actually feel very prepared. And the reason for that is, we have reduced a number of innovations in \u201820 by half of what we had in 2019. And as we go into 2021, it\u2019s another third that we\u2019re reducing. And at the same time, that innovation is actually going to have a bigger impact in terms of overall drive in sales since we go into 2021. So a much more fewer -- much more focus on fewer, bigger, better innovations. We\u2019re also focused on the right SKU so that we can better service our customers. Thanks for the question.\nJonathan Feeney: That\u2019s great, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Miguel Patricio for closing comments. \nMiguel Patricio: Okay, well. Thank you very much for your presence here with us and [indiscernible]. And I just want to finalize and repeat some of the things we said during this call. We had stronger than expected Q3 results, and that is already reflecting the agility that we are creating in our win rates.  We have been able to manage this shift at home versus away from home consumption and at impressive speed. We are holding on to new households and consumers in a greater rate that we thought and the result of that is that our market share is showing pretty good times of improvement.  Our strategy is really moving or already moved from organizing really to watch. We are investing in the business, investments are ramping up. We have today a much better team and performance in all levels and this better-position Kraft Heinz to sustain gain. We, are as I said before, confidently optimistic in the near term performance. And that\u2019s why we raised our 2020 outlook. And in 2021, the financials are ahead of what is expected growing our strategic plan.  So, with that thank you very much. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Well, thank you Chris. And good morning, everyone. I would like to start our business update by sharing the sentiment I provided earlier today in our earnings release. You have heard me say frequently that we were cautiously optimistic about the path forward. But our momentum has been building, causing us to turn more confidently optimistic. This is based on three facts. First, in the previous two quarters, our results benefited from the scale that Kraft Heinz could bring in the immediate response to the pandemic. Our exceptionally strong third quarter performance reflects the agility of our organization and our ability to sustain momentum. Second, the changes in consumer priorities continue to support greater at home consumption and increased demand for our brands. And third, our strategic work is moving from planning and organizing into action. Based on these three factors, we are raising our 2020 outlook and continue to expect 2021 results to be ahead of the strategic plan we finalized earlier this year.  To better make these points. Let me share a few relevant charts. Slide 6 presents an updated view of our at home or retail versus away from home or food service sales performance. The charts show Kraft Heinz's year on year sales growth by geography from Q1 through Q3. The abrupt and unprecedented shifting between at home and away from home consumption that we saw in the first half of the year continued through the third quarter. At our Investor Day, we spoke at length about the many things we have been doing to become more creative, more agile and more efficient. And despite both volatile demands, and in some areas constrained capacity, our teams around the world are demonstrating their ability to adapt to demand through a mindset of growth. Our agility led to a very strong second half of September, as retail demand accelerated yet again, and we responded effectively and efficiently. As a result, our Q3 top and bottom line performance was stronger that's what we projected at our Investor Day on September 15. We have talked about 2020 being the first year of a turnaround. We said, it would be a year in which we laid the foundation for future growth, stabilized our underlying profitability and maintain our industry leading margins, all while we rebuilt our business momentum. It is clear that this is happening, as you can see on slide seven. From the first half through the third quarter, we have sustained underlying top and bottom line moment. Even as we take on additional COVID related costs and supply constraints, we have been keeping our cost of goods under control. Also as we outlined in February, we are resetting our base through divestiture, business exit and the normalization of incentive compensation. Our underlying growth is tracking with our strategy. Platform growth is consistent with the portfolio rolls we have defined with grow platforms up 7% year-to-date and energize platforms up 8%. And what we find very encouraging is that, while taste elevation is growing middle single-digits, excluding food service, taste elevation is growing roughly 20%.  Emerging markets growth is accelerating, up 9% in Q3 versus 7% year-to-date. The simplification that our platform approach and portfolio rolls bring is a key enabler in guiding us and measuring our success as we move through off fence. This visibility is critical as consumers preferences evolve and we need to adapt to serve different needs. Which brings me to another reason for our confidence in our past going forward. We are seeing consumer preferences evolve in ways that indicates that elevated demand for both at home consumption and big trusted brands will remain strong going forward. We are seeing stickiness in at home consumption, as consumers discover or rediscover cooking at home and at home meal experience.  We see them reassessing the shopping trip. With bigger baskets and greater bundling, affordability is the rising concern which should be a benefit to those companies that are fast to adapt and have a strong presence up and down the price value ladder. Consumers are gravitating towards big brands and our retail partners are reassessing assortment with availability and velocity, a key determinant for it.  And consumers are increasingly choosing brands that can better align with their values. These consumer trends are tailwinds, causing us to turn more confidently optimistic in the near term. The actions we have already taken to put our operating model in motion and the things that we needed to fix the most heading to our turnaround are many of the same things needed to adapt to an unpredictable environment with faster, greater changes in the consumer demand. For instance, since late last year, we focused on improving our people efforts by revamping and deploying new training and development programs. In many ways, we were also ahead of the game in our efforts to reduce stress and burn out and boost moral [ph]. And just last week, Kraft Heinz was named to the top quartile of Forbes Magazine list of World's Best Employers, after not even making the list of 750 companies last year. This is very positive reinforcement for all our efforts. We have talked our plans about the many things as a way to transform our company, from adapting our innovation pipeline to eliminating waste, to driving productivity as well as better planning with our partners, and ramping up investments in our brands, and our capacity, and our reach ecommerce and emerging markets. The point is that we now have the framework and visibility to distort resources, reverse savings, where we have the most advantage, and the greatest opportunities to grow. And most important, we are moving from planning and organizing to action.  I will close my opening comments by summarizing a few points. We had stronger than expected Q3 results due to the greater agility we are creating. The consumer trends we are seeing and the actions under way give us more confidence that our momentum will remain strong in the near-term. And we expect to continue exceeding our regional strategic plan into 2021.  I will pass it on to Carlos now to provide more color on how we are seeing this taking shape in our biggest business. Thank you Paolo. To quickly summarize what we have seen and what we see going forward, our momentum remains strong as we rebuild our company through a mindset of growth. We are now moving to offense, able to reinvest savings and realize near-term upside in a purposeful prioritized way. And we expect to continue performing ahead of our strategic plan.  Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Well, let me start that and then [indiscernible]. We haven't really felt the effect of the crisis that we have. So that is ex-GDP. We continue to see a pretty big acceleration in consumption. And of course part of that is; number one, because of how consumption growing because of the pandemic. But number two, because of consumers going back to first the brand. I think that at this moment, there's a big need for brands that people trust. That's a big trend from the past, there was a need of experimentation of brands and other things. What we see at this moment related to affordability is a change towards the fact. So we are selling more [indiscernible] than we were before. So mix impact. Carlos you've got to complement if you have? Thank you. No, thank you. And thanks for the question. So, I think the way I think about in terms of capacity is there are some pockets of capacity constraints, but really nothing that should be holding us back in a significant way. We have been making significant strides on improving our capacity in those lines that we have constrained. I think you have to talk about the fact that in those constraints line, we've actually driving 20% more out of those lines that we have ever done. So, it's also both making sure that we address that. But also is that we are also more agile to making sure we put the capacity that we have where we need it and working with our customers in collaborative way.  And some of that agility that also translates on how we actually working with our partners differently. Because we know that for example, let me just take one, which is Mac & Cheese. Well Mac & Cheese really the only constraint we have within Mac & Cheese cups. So what we have done is work collaborative with our retail partners, so that we can actually flex our marketing and promotion so that we can emphasize our box Mac & Cheese. And that kind of segmentation and focusing with our partners into the places where we do have a lot of capacity that actually has worked well. And it also is part of the reason why you're seeing that translating to improved share performance. Yes. I complementing what you said. He means the national the International zones, we are seeing stable for [indiscernible]. The most remarkable growth is coming from Brazil, from Russia, and from the Middle East. In Canada, we are actually gaining share in 70% of the categories that we operate. We have problems with coffee, especially because of Mac FX. That is not in the face and that's very representative for Canada. It was about 5% of the net sales for business in Canada. But generally, this will no longer be in the base. So, that complements the great momentum we have in US [indiscernible] things in reference in some of our products [indiscernible] very good momentum. We know we talked about it a bit, tried to give you a maybe a little more color in terms of how we think about our demand, and making sure that that it does stick. We do see, and we saw this in Q3 with consumers coming back to our brands in a much stronger way.  So the fact is that when you look at the results, we're really encouraged about the rate of new buyer repurchasing a product that it's two or more times. So, it's know that they're coming back, but they're actually coming at a higher rate than we have seen in the past. And we are also seeing that, particularly in a big brands. So, let me give an example of Philadelphia, the repeat is up 23%, as users really are looking for more user location, what to do with whether that is not just baking, but actually breakfast as well.  And we're seeing places like Oscar Mayer, where people are preparing more at home lunches and they're using our products in new occasions now that they are spending more time at home. So if you take it all together, then you say, okay. First, our big brands that really resonated with those new consumers. Those consumers are actually now that they are trying our brands are seeing the great taste, quality and value advantage that we bring. So, they're actually coming back at a higher rate.

            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos. And good morning everyone. I will quickly walk through some key highlights of our results and then provide our expectations for the plans forward. I will begin where Carlos left off with the US business. Organic net sales in the US increased 7.4% in spite of a roughly 1 point drag from the Mac FX [ph] which began July 1. Volume mix growth across retail, e-commerce and club channels was strong and more than offset lower food services sales. Pricing was up 4% from a combination of lower promotional activity in certain categories to protect customer service, selective blend price actions and commodity driven pricing primarily in cheese. These effects are expected to fade in Q4 as we begin to wrap prior year pricing actions. And we expect to return to more normal levels of promotional activity. At adjusted EBITDA even though we saw the key headwinds mentioned on our last earnings call, better retail performance, positive pricing, favorable mix, and strong procurement deficiencies more than offset those impacts. In our international segment, Q3 top-line performance, check three of the boxes of the strategy we outlined [indiscernible] at Investor Day. First, we delivered the mid-single digit growth with a relatively balanced contribution from volume and price. Second, growth was led by emerging markets with outside gains in priority markets, including Russia, Brazil and in taste elevation in China. And finally, we advanced our aspiration of global leadership in taste elevation with over 1 of share growth in that part. Taking together, this top-line growth fuelled 6.8% constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and more than offset higher supply chain costs, including incremental COVID-related expenses, and normalized incentive compensation. Looking forward, our outlook for the International segment is largely consistent with what we expressed in July. We anticipate results specifically on the top-line to soften in the remainder of the year compared to the year-to-date trend. Finally, in Canada, Q3 organic net sales growth decelerated relative to the first half. Here, lower coffee and food sub-shipments more than offset pricing gains and strong platform growth. In fact, Q3 retail consumption for easy meals made better in taste elevation, our two priority consumer platforms in Canada, grew at a double-digit rate and we increased share in 70% of all categories. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA improved sequentially, as we fully lapsed the divestiture of the Canadian, which is built in Q3. That said, we still saw declines versus prior year due to the Mac FX. Excluding the Mac FX impact, constant currency adjusted EBITDA would have been virtually flat with the prior year as consumption growth offsets supply chain cost inflation mainly logistics, as well as high incentive compensation. For Q4, we expect a combination of softer food services sales this year in seasonally strong Mac FX sales in the prior year to weigh on organic sales. These effects are likely to mask strong, although moderating retail consumption growth in carry forward price initiatives. EBITDA is likely to be more resilient and remain near run-rate margin levels with positive pricing and favorable mix more or less offsetting higher operational costs. Looking at the total company results, there are two things I'd like to highlight before going to our outlook. One is the low EBITDA items and the other is free cash flow. In July, we reiterated our prior forecast for $0.38 below the line headwinds due to a combination of higher tax, lower other income and higher equity compensation. Those three factors played out mostly as expected in Q3 with $0.12 negative impacts to adjusted EPS. That brought the year-to-date impact to $0.31 and remains in line with an approximate impact of $0.38 for the full year, a few item rank the rating today. Also keep in mind, that this impact is primarily non-cash in nature. In terms of free cash flow, year-to-date 2020 free cash flow has more than doubled compared with the first nine months of 2019. Much of the increase has been driven by year-to-date sales and adjusted EBITDA growth. However some of it is also due to favorable approval timing and lower CapEx spend which we expect to reverse in Q4. Furthermore, working capital as a source of cash should be comparatively less than it was in Q4 last year as we aim to reduce inventory levels.  That said, we are confident that free cash flow will be significantly better than 2019 levels. And we would expect free cash flow conversion to be roughly in line with our long term target of a 100% for the full year in 2020. Given where we are in the year and based on what you have been seen to-date, we are raising our outlook for Q4 and for the full year. We now expect organic net sales to grow mid-single-digits in Q4, as that would result in mid-single-digit growth for the full year. For adjusted EBITDA, we see high single-digit constant currency growth in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, we are now expecting high single-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. In terms of cash flow and leverage, we expect the strong performance to-date to result in a 100% free cash flow conversion for the year and net leverage to be approximately four times by the end of the year. Looking into 2021, we now have things in place to accelerate our investment with a strong visibility on returns and built on the momentum we established this year.  It is difficult to predict consumer behavior and the balance between at home versus away from home consumption going forward. So we will focus on what we do control, in fact our objectives are proper. From an organic sales perspective, our focus will be to retain and develop market household gains we made in 2020, and improve our growth trajectory from agile portfolio management. For EBITDA, we will accelerate the growth investments especially towards emerging markets and deliver adjusted EBITDA above our strategic plan. We continue to be committed to a strong return of cash to shareholders and we will continue to reduce gross debt outstanding, accelerated by the proceeds of the pending Cheese transaction.  With that, let me turn it back to Miguel to close. Yes, I made that list. And we are generating cash. As we said, we have a very strong cash generation this year, you have to pay down pretty much more than $1 billion in debt already. And just to say that we intend to keep paying down debt next year with a strong cash flow that this company here generates. But the dimension was pretty much to say that you're going to use, you're going to be paying down that every year to focus on the gross debt reduction. And of course, as you generate cash, our net debt also will go down. I can't take this one Alexia. I think I'm going to start here talking about like the comment about the pricing. And then maybe ask Carlos to talk to get the USPS I think is the good way to approach that. One thing that we see is that, as we comment, the first thing in Q4, we are going to start lapping some price increases we had in Q4 last year. So that is one of the components that we mentioned. So, in a relative basis. So, we're going to start lapping this price. And again, given the constraints that we had, and I'm going to ask Carlos to complement there, we are also coming back to a better or a more normal level of promotions. But then I'm going to ask Carlos to build on that."

            "content": "Thank you, Miguel and good morning everyone. I think that analogy I will use to describe this past quarter is that we successfully have been driving down the road at 90 miles per hour to keep up with all the demand while we are changing the tires. Now that takes ownership and agility and our teams are showing it in speed.  As Miguel mentioned, our third quarter results demonstrate our new organization quickly adapt to opportunities, and it was evident across our U.S. business as we finish out the quarter. As you can see on Slide 12, we maintain a strong momentum in both the top and bottom line. Organic net sales growth reflected higher household penetration and repeat rates and a revenue management discipline. An outstanding execution and efficiency in operations and procurement resulted in strong adjusted EBITDA gain, even as a number of headwinds began to have a greater impact in Q3.  With this, while demand shifted between channels on a week to week basis and the organization advanced the divestiture of our natural cheese business. While we can't predict the future three things give us further cause for concern, as Miguel mentioned, we are encouraged by the continuing trend to our greater at home consumption. Second is that we are seeing more consumers coming back to our brands. And third, we are now better positioned to retain and grow both new and loyal consumers respond to rapidly changing demand and further capitalize on the gains we have made in the last nine months. Keeping with a driving analogy, operationally, we have turned a corner. I am pleased to share that we have rapidly moved from reorganizing to execution. And we are now in position to properly deploy resources and execute in a way that continues to build on the positive consumption trends we're experiencing. To give you a better idea of what this means. In people, our new business unit structure is now fully operational and fully staffed. We have made recent external leadership additions in consumer insights and sales leads with major customers. These additions complement several internal placements in new or evolve critical role. All helping to carry out a new foundation of processes with a growth mindset. The work we have done to put people first is paying off. We have seen higher engagement among our current employees. And we are continuing to attract top tier talent into the organization more rapidly than ever before. And we're building and strengthening both organizational and individual capabilities. This includes leveraging digital as an enabler, which will allow us to accelerate our growth and raise the bar on what it means to be a better. Turning to our platforms. Significant work on all six platforms is underway in the U.S. zone. And what results will be more evident in 2021. I'll show in a moment that we have already stored resources and investment to fuel our grow and energize platforms. In our ops centers, collaboration across our entire supply chain contribute a significant amount to our success this quarter. Including holding cost of goods under control. Even with incremental COVID driven cuts, demand volatility and supply constraint. In addition, our focus on operational excellence in manufacturing has enabled us to increase year-over-year production in the low single digit range overall, and by roughly 20% on lines where we have constrained supply relative to strong demand. In Q3, this include relieving constraints in high demand categories like cocas, cream cheese, mac and cheese and stuffing, helping us to sustain already strong household penetration and share trends, which I'll talk about shortly. And anticipating continue demand, we expect to go from double to triple digit investment dollars to improve capacity in 2021. We've also made significant progress in our partner program, with customer citing much earlier and much deeper planning than in the past. To date, we have conducted more than 40 top-to-top meetings with key retailers with another 40-planned in the coming weeks. In each meeting, we are sharing our transformational plans as well a joint business plans for the coming year. It's allowing us to be more strategic in category development and value creation. And while we're doing a lot to maintain retail momentum, we're also finding opportunities to better support our food service partners. From piloting new innovations like steel-touch dispensers to helping create unique menu items to drive traffic and sales for our partners. We have quickly be with it to adapt to market needs. All of this is beginning to result in consumers voting more often for us. As you can see on Slide 14, our retail market share has been continuously improving over the past year, running up to the end of September. This has been driven by an improvement in the overall health of the portfolio. As we have had increased capacity, invested in marketing, adapted our communication and built stronger collaborations with our customers. The percent of our retail sales where we grow and share has gone from only 20% in the first half to 41% in Q3 and up to 58% in September. And we are fixing our biggest categories. As the percent of our categories where we are gaining share has gone from 36% to 49% over the same time period. Some of this is due to resolving supply constraint in some key categories. For instance, Oscar Mayer cocas, part of our fast fresh meals platform and an area we are energizing saw share growth this quarter for the first time in 18-months. This was the result of fast adapting a product mix to raw materials availability, and capacity constraints, as well as the agility to activate and execute differently with customers. Some of this is due to greater focus and prioritization that our platform approach is bringing. For instance, in our taste elevation platform, we grew market share during Q3 in over 70% of the categories we compete. More importantly, we are well positioned and have the right plans in place to build them. I have shown previously that our household penetration is one of the inherited strength of our portfolio relative to the industry. And how this has strengthened further since the onset of COVID-19. We continue to see increase household penetration and repeat rates across a sizable portion of their portfolio, including core brands, like Kraft Mac and Cheese, Philadelphia and Planters. But what is most encouraging is the rate of new buyer repurchasing our products two or more time, we've now doubled the rate versus what we've seen last year. To build our base of loyal consumers and keep this momentum going, we are stepping up our marketing investment by 40% in the second half of this year, compared with the second half last year, and 70% compared with the first half of this year. We will have more work in dollars as a percent of our span as well. To close here, our third quarter was very encouraging as we began to see ourselves bringing agility to our scale. And with our organization prioritization and 2021 plans in place. We are well positioned to sustain the momentum we have benefited from so far in 2020.  With that, I'll turn it over to Paulo to talk through our financial results and outlook. Yes, Miguel. So, I guess let me just go back to something that I said during Investor Day, which is not so much about fighting with private label as it is co-existing with private label. I think at this time, what consumers are looking from us is to make sure we continue to emphasize the value that we can bring. And we certainly do that with our brands. If you think about all the recessions, big brands tend to win as well as some of the private label. But then smaller brands actually do not perform as well. And I think that's playing out that way. So, if you look at our Q3 results, our shares actually improved throughout the quarter. And as we go into Q4, we can continue to invest behind our marketing. We've seen that continuing in the next quarter as well. Thank you, Andrew, and we do appreciate you recognizing the changes we're making. And let me start with giving you a little bit of context about how we rethinking our sales organization. And for us, it was around how do we actually build agility in the organization and in three different pieces? How do we reorganize our structure, upgrading our processes and really stalling grid discipline and how we spend? So, I mean I think you speak about the reorganization we have made. We have brought new talent, and I think what I'm most proud of is the huge amount of experience and diversity of thinking that we're also bringing into Kraft Heinz. And we're also making sure we are changing how our account structure so that we can focus on those critical partners. And then internally, we have also centralized our customer development and revenue management teams to make sure we really leverage our scale in a different way. So, as you said, some of the key times we have not only a new Head of Sales, but people under him actually account for over 50% of our overall sales in the US. So, that is a significant new leadership that we have put into critical places. And then as we work with our customers, I'll tell you that one of the things that they also think to be noticing is that we have also upgraded our processes. So we are pulling forward planning cycle to make sure we better match their timelines, which something that we haven't done in the past. And then making sure we have that greatest discipline that I spoke about, which is, make sure we have clear planning timelines that we commit and deliver. And we have the clarity to drive accountability and speed internally.  And if you take a step back, Andrew, I think what you see is that that kind of improved execution is showing up both in terms of our growth, as well as the sequential improvement we're seeing in market share.  So, I am very pleased with the talent that we bring in the organization, again with the discipline, with the experience, and the diversity of thinking that I think is going to continue to make us a stronger company as we go forward. Thank you. If I can take that one at least for the U.S., and then if there's anything else, Miguel, you want to come in for performance on share. What I will say is that if you look at the way we're now thinking about our business. We're looking at how we go from 55 categories to the six platforms that we identified during Investor Day. I think the thing that is very encouraging for us is that we are seeing strong performance across all six growth platforms. Particularly the two areas we designated as growth platform around taste, elevation and easy meals made better. Those are adding really strong penetration rates. So, it is not only the fact that we are driving, improved share, but also is that we actually continue to drive the penetration in the places we really are going after. And that is done because of the work that we're doing. So for example, there are things we're doing taste elevation. And let me take the example the Heinz brand, we are benefiting as we are actually focused on those co-schools that we identified during our Investor Day, whether that was burgers and fries and nuggets, and those locations are actually driving even higher.  So, the places that we said that we're going to be focusing on are actually the behavior that we've seen consumers actually doing more of as we go into this in most recent quarters. And then if you look at things like eating meals made better, we have areas like mac and cheese. We also seen how they continued to come back as they are now understanding how good the product is. How they're doing more prepared meals at home, whether that is with mac and cheese, or with our classical plasticizer, or either potatoes. So, it's a combination of us improving on the way we think about our consumers with a stronger focus on the consumer platform, as well as continue to drive improved focus on our penetration of our brands and driving with better marketing.  Before I get to your questions about the overall inventory levels, I don't know Miguel anything else you wanted to comment in terms of share. Thank you, Miguel. And then Rob, I think the other part of your question was around the inventory levels. I think that what we -- let me just -- I guess, put it within the context first of all, we saw in Q3, which is we did see some rebuilding of retail inventories, when you look at year-over-year. But that would really as a result of the drill down that we saw in Q1. So, it does vary by customer. But overall, I think we are seeing that progression of most of that recovery happen for what we saw in Q1. Now, the reality is that, we don't know what the precision is of where retailer are going to end up in terms of the number of days of inventory they're going to be carrying as we go forward. So that still to be known. What we -- what I can tell you we're doing is we actually working very collaborative with our customers to make sure that as they are preparing for a holiday season that I think in many ways would be unprecedented.  And then secondly is in places where we know that our consumers are looking to expand maybe into non-traditional categories. So we are seeing things like in our mid-business that actually recover in Q3 and we saw the improvement in share with some of the mid-business that normally wouldn't sell as much in Q4, we've seen already the improved performance in consumption as we go into the holiday so.  So net-net I will tell you is that we are working collaborative. We are seeing some improvement in Q3 in terms of retail inventories. Where exactly it's going to land? Not as clear yet. But we're going to be there with our customers to make sure we do the right thing. Yes. Yes, thank you Paulo. In the U.S., what I will say is that we're beginning to now return to more normal levels of promotion and activity. I think you saw effect some of that already at Labor Day time period. And if you look at not only the actual Labor Day weekend but also overall, you take a step back and look at back to school performance. That back to school was actually pretty in line to what we saw last year. So that shows, I think that we are returning back that our customers want to make sure that we have the right pricing as we go into the remaining of the year.  So it was both in terms of us seeing that, we are ready in terms of having an availability of capacity to make sure we have the right promotions back in place, as well as working with our customers to make sure that we're there when we know consumers are going to be looking for our brands regardless of the channel whether that is in brick and mortar or ecommerce. And again, I think that -- if you look at it again, you see, just to finish the thought there is that. What you see is the market share performance, I think will show that kind of returning to promotions at the right level that we're doing as we go back and have the availability and the right investment with our customers. Just to build more than in branding adding, I would say building U.S. meal. What I would say is that -- well, it's difficult to say how the customers are going to stay in terms of levels of inventory and SKU levels. There are things that we are doing internally to make sure that we have the most agile supply chain organization. And that includes us reducing the number of SKUs as we go into next year. So from what we had a year ago, to what you'll see in 2021 is about down 20% of number of SKUs. That actually is something that as we work collaborative with our customer shows that we're able to then make sure that we respond with the type of service they need in the core SKUs that they're also looking for. So, now that doesn't take away from us being able to also stay focused in the kind of innovation that we want to bring. So we are doing both reducing our SKUs by 20%, to make sure we have that gilt in our supply chain. At the same time, we also are still focused on innovation as we go into 2021 in which we actually feel very prepared. And the reason for that is, we have reduced a number of innovations in \u201820 by half of what we had in 2019. And as we go into 2021, it's another third that we're reducing. And at the same time, that innovation is actually going to have a bigger impact in terms of overall drive in sales since we go into 2021. So a much more fewer -- much more focus on fewer, bigger, better innovations. We're also focused on the right SKU so that we can better service our customers. Thanks for the question."

I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.\nChris Jakubik: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our business update. We'll begin today's call with an overview of our second quarter 2020 results, as well as an update on our path forward from Miguel Patricio, our CEO; Paulo Basilio, our CFO; and Carlos Abrams-Rivera, the Head of our U.S. business. We will then open the lines to take your questions. Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations with our \u2013 within our earnings release. Now let's turn to slide three, and I'll hand it over to Miguel.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I think it's appropriate to start today by saying that more than anything else, the strength of our second quarter results reflect the hard work and dedication of our remarkable employees around the world. Without them, we would not have reported numbers anywhere near what you saw in our press release today. On our April call, I said that the coming months would be critical in understanding the path forward and potential for our industry for Kraft Heinz and the pace of our turnaround. Three months later, I can tell you that while the path of the economy and consumer behavior remains difficult for any of us to predict, our team has done an excellent work, anticipating and responding with speed, agility and creativity. And we can see this in the quality of our second quarter results. More importantly, we continue to make great progress on our turnaround. Our people are driving functional excellence throughout the organization. We are developing better perspectives on where consumers are going and how we can win. Our productivity initiatives are progressing and strong free cash flow is further improving our financial profile. All these things are coming through in what we will cover today in our business update, where we will talk about how we are adapting to consumer needs, to Q2 results that were much stronger-than-expected, due to continued momentum and strong consumer demand for our brands, as well as better-than-anticipated costs and supply chain performance and the fact that our solid execution is keeping us cautiously optimistic for the rest of the year. Carlos and I will begin today with how our business has responded so far and our current thoughts about the path forward, before Paolo discusses the financials and then we'll take your questions. The first chart I wanted to share is our underlying year-on-year sales growth by geography, in both retail and foodservice channels. It shows the progression from Q1 to the April spike to the May-June settling out period. There are three important points to take away from this chart. First, it's the tremendous and abrupt shift in consumer behavior that we are witnessing. These are sales of the food and beverage products, not microchips. So to describe the magnitude of this channel shift as unprecedented feels like; an understatement. Second, the numbers in the chart are Kraft Heinz sales, not the broader market, not the broader categories where we play. And it's important to recognize that our supply chain capabilities are largely split between capacity to produce and service retail sales and producing and servicing food service sales. There is little overlap in terms of production lines and route to market. So what this chart reflects is that, during this period we have been able to successfully adapt to such an abrupt unprecedented change in consumer behavior. Keep everyone of our plants around the world up and running, producing at industry-leading quality and safety levels and therefore enable us to deliver more than 7% organic net sales growth in Q2. This is not to say that, we capture 100% of the opportunity. As you know, there are some categories where we have lost share and we are working hard to fix that. That said, I have seen the creativity and agility our teams around the world have demonstrated in meeting peak demand. Learning through the journey, as we like to call it and ultimately, delivering roughly twice the organic growth we expected in April, which brings me to the third point; the source of Q2 upside, versus our previous expectations. The decline we saw in foodservice sales on a global basis was largely consistent with what we had forecasted, somewhat better in the U.S. and at a softer end of the range in our international business. At the same time, our retail performance was much better than anticipated. In the United States, which Carlos will speak to, in our international zone where in condiments and sauces, we grew double digits and in several markets, achieved record market share. And in Canada, where we had double-digit growth and gained share in 80% of our retail categories as the team invested to strengthen brand relevancy in areas like peanut butter, pasta sauce and Kraft dinners. In addition, what is not shown on this chart, but we will discuss later, is the extraordinary retail sales growth came with favorable category and product mix. Together, the combination of favorable channel, category and product mix resulted in better-than-expected EBITDA margins versus what we originally expected, most notable in our United States business. At the same time and the second part of the business update, it's important to reiterate that we remain at the beginning stages of our turnaround and are still not where we want to be on several fronts, which we will talk about in great detail in September. We have done a lot to adapt to the pandemic, but we are also implementing a new operating model to improve our performance on a sustainable basis. We are making significant changes to how we work, how we are organizing our business, how we are developing our capabilities, and how we are reinvesting in the business. Our actions have been broad-based with the intent to create sustainable competitive advantage across our value chain. For instance, we have continued to work urgently and diligently to ensure the health and safety of our employees, taking on additional costs for personal protective equipment in our plants, as well as to accommodate working from home. At the same time, during the second quarter, we rolled out our new company purpose, vision, values and leadership principles. We are redefining for our employees for the long-term our true north and how we are going to win by working as a team, inspiring excellence and navigate our future. I want to specifically mention, one of our company values. We demand diversity. We live in a world where systemic racism and inequality exists. And writing these wrongs requires an equally systemic response from everyone, including global corporations like ours. We have a responsibility to be part of the solution. Honest conversations with our African-American Business Resource Group led to a range of initiatives, including a $1 million commitment to food programs and social justice organizations serving black communities, as well as our first Global Day of Service on June 10 last month. From internal mentoring and developing programs and expanded talent recruitment partnerships, to supplier training programs for minority and women owned businesses, and the creation of a cross-functional inclusion council, we are proactive and hold ourselves and our company accountable for bringing about the positive change. Changing times demand fresh, new approaches. For consumers, we are actively modeling multiple growth scenarios and defining new initiatives to adapt to each scenario. At the same time, we have now reorganized our business units around new consumer-led platforms, so we can better address our consumers. With our customers and in-marketing, on improving communications today, but also how we deploy our resources to drive growth going forward. With customers specifically, collaboration has been key, as we are creatively addressing immediate customer needs on one hand while simultaneously trying to set plans for the coming year. In supply chain, the difference a year has made is simply incredible. We are finding efficiency to mitigate incremental COVID costs, while taking actions to optimize and ensure production. At the same time, we continue to implement continuous improvement processes and programs for sustainable savings for the years to come. In many ways, we are leveraging our intentional strategic changes to better respond to an environment with significant uncertainty. As a result, I'm confident that we'll emerge a stronger Kraft Heinz. And the strategic direction we have set is the right one and one that we look forward to discussing in detail with you on September 15. I will close my opening comments here by summarizing a few points. We had stronger-than-expected Q2 results, reflecting continued momentum and strong consumer demand for our brands. We are implementing our new enterprise-wide strategy at the same time we are adapting to the pandemic. After a year as CEO, I can see our business transformation well underway, with strong employee model, a well-defined strategy and a team in place, working together with speed to bring agility with scale. And our work to-date has only confirmed that we are on the right path. To bring this more to life, I'm going to ask Carlos to provide more color on how our U.S. business is performing in the marketplace and how he sees the path forward.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Miguel and good morning, everyone. My comments today are going to focus on what we have experienced so far, how we are preparing for the road ahead and hopefully address a number of the questions many of you have raised about our recent performance. In terms of what we have experienced, to say it's being intense, dynamic and rewarding will be an understatement. We have been working hard to optimize our manufacturing capacity to meet extraordinary demand, running some of our plants 24/7. This has caused us to cancel some programming and reallocate spending to the second half of the year. So, for instance, we had to pull back on our Memorial Day event for the first time ever. And not having that event removed the drive period in the quarter when we typically have very high market share. And average price gaps increased versus the prior year as a result. In areas like our Oscar Mayer meat and Kraft single businesses, our share has been negatively impacted by sustained elevated consumption versus supply chain constraints, while more vertically integrated players have been able to shift capacity from their foodservice businesses to retail. So while we're growing strongly in those businesses, we are seeing some share loss. Elsewhere in the portfolio, Heinz, Jell-O, Ore-Ida are gaining share, even with this accelerated consumption. In a nutshell, promotional activity and the pace of inventory recovery, both ours and our retail partners, have been dictated by the balance of supply and demand. What that means for us is, growth has been good, but in certain categories, we know we can do better. If demand remains extraordinarily strong, growth should be fine, but share is likely to be challenging in certain categories. Which brings me to how we are preparing. From a consumption perspective, we are preparing for all the economic letters, the V, the U, the W, et cetera, but with an eye to the long term. Investing to win on a sustainable basis. So to that end, we have now realigned our U.S. business unit structure, designed around the new platform based strategy, which we will unveil in September. We are implementing a new operating model to ensure we operate with a growth mindset, a high level of accountability and streamlined roles, responsibilities and decision rights for each role. We are capturing savings from continuous improvements, leveraging the upside we have seen to-date to invest even more than anticipated to renovate and differentiate our brands. And we are working hard to understand who is new to our brands and the best way to meaningfully connect with them. So regarding our path forward, while the depth and duration of this downturn will guide consumption in the near term, we are transforming our business for a better growth trajectory in the medium to long term. And consumers' embracement of our brands are providing us a significant opportunity right now. For instance, household penetration is one of the inherent strengths of our portfolio relative to the industry. And you would think that there was not much more room to go, but our household penetration has strengthened further in the later 15 weeks. In fact, 75% of our brands are growing household penetration, and the majority of our brands growing household penetration are up double-digit percentages points versus the same period last year. Across our iconic brands, we are experiencing growing household penetration and increasing the rate of repeat among new buyers. This includes big brands that were already well-established and significant leaders in their categories, such as Heinz in ketchup, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Ore-Ida, Planters, Philadelphia and Capri Sun. In terms of repeat rates, new buyers are repeating at higher rates than in the past and buying more frequently. In fact, 75% of new buyers since the pandemic started are still buying our products now. And finally, regarding new buyer demographics, smaller households, including those with no kids, are finding our brands. And our new buyer household skewed to higher income, younger and more diverse parts of the population, areas we have historically under indexed. All this means we have a tremendous opportunity to build our base of loyal consumers, and we're going after this aggressively with a second half plan that includes a 40% increase in working media dollars versus a year ago. To close, I just want to say how very proud I am of our colleagues for how they have responded to the challenges of the moment across our value chain and are showing tremendous agility in redeploying marketing investments to connect with the millions who are now making our brands part of their everyday lives. With that, I will turn it over to Paulo to talk through our financial results and outlook for the second half. Thank\nPaulo Basilio: Thank you Carlos and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our results, I think it's useful to outline some overall key drivers of the quarter that were consistent across our different segments. On our April call, I outlined 4 factors we expected to drive better profitability in Q2 versus Q1. One, was improved product mix, mainly from categories within retail as well as a favorable shift between retail and foodservice. Two, higher volumes. Three, greater efficiency in operations as we were adjusting to the higher volumes. And four, a better balance between price and commodity costs. In the end, all these factors came into play and were directionally consistent with our expectations. What pushed our growth and profitability higher than anticipated was a combination of stronger retail demand for longer than we anticipated, a better than projected relationship between price and commodity costs and a more favorable category and product mix within our retail sales. These factors were most pronounced in our U.S. business. So that's where I will start. Organic net sales in the U.S. increased 8.5%. This was mainly driven by 6.2 percentage points of volume/mix growth, led by the strong retail performance Carlos described. Pricing was up, as it reflected lower promotional activity to capacity constraints in certain categories. Taken together, volume leverage, favorable canine product mix, as well as favorable pricing, adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter increased 17.6%. Specifically regarding mix, we saw favorable category mix in the form of relatively stronger demand and market share performance in areas like ketchup and condiments, mac and cheese and frozen potatoes. We also saw favorable SKU mix within categories due to supply chain constraints and, therefore, greater sales of core items within our product lines. Looking forward, we are not anticipating retail demand to remain as strong as we saw in Q2 and likely to moderate further from recent levels with category mix normalizing and foodservice being a greater part of total sales. In addition, keep in mind that the McCaf\u00e9 exit is now underway and will, therefore, tamper organic growth beginning in Q3. As a result, at this point, while Q3 profits should be higher than we anticipated three months ago, Q3 margins are likely to be closer to prior year levels as organic growth moderates, the favorable mix we saw in Q2 phased and pressures from the recent spike in commodity inflation, specifically in cheese, come into play. While this would represent a significant change sequentially from Q2 to Q3, we believe it is the most realistic expectation based on the best estimates in consumption and cost trends today. Moving to our International segment. Results were largely consistent with our initial expectations, with organic net sales up 5.5% versus the prior year period and roughly equal contributions from volume mix and pricing. Pricing accelerated to 2.6% from a combination of reduced promotional activity, carryover benefits from previous pricing actions and inflation related pricing in Brazil. Volume/mix increased 2.9% from strong growth in condiment and sauces, along with growth in mill oriented categories, more than offset a decline in both foodservice and infant nutrition. Looking forward, we are expecting the deceleration we saw in growth during the second quarter to continue into Q3 as markets normalize, particularly in our biggest market in the U.K. And while the pace of normalization is unpredictable, we currently anticipate back half results, both organic sales growth and margins to soften compared to the first half. Finally is Canada, where the Q2 turnaround we anticipated was even stronger than expected. In April, we said we thought that organic sales growth would improve sequentially, but remained negative versus the prior year, given the McCafe exit, lower food service sales and lower year-on-year pricing. In the end, our Canada team delivered 2% organic growth, with pricing turning positive for the first time in seven quarters and retail consumption growth in every category. The positive pricing reflected a combination of reduced promotional activity versus the prior year, as well as successful implementation of select but necessary list price increases. Also, volume/mix was positive, as stronger-than-expected retail takeaway more than offset lower foodservice sales and a negative 4.4 percentage point impact from McCafe exit. At EBITDA, we initially expected Q2 margins to begin returning to prior year levels. Actual results were slightly better, with an adjusted EBITDA margin up nearly 30 basis points versus the prior year, as improved supply chain performance added to gains from pricing and volume/mix. For the second half of the year, we would expect the improved performance in Canada to continue, with a sustained recovery in profitability, although with more normalized retail takeaway trends being offset by the ongoing headwinds from McCafe exit and lower food service sales. Turning now to total company results and our outlook for the year. There are just three additional notes I would make on our Q2 results. First is that, each business segment reported organic sales and EBITDA growth in Q2, and we hope this indicates more stable performance across our businesses going forward. Second, our taxes. On our last call, I flagged the possibility of a higher effective tax rate in Q2, due to the possible enactment of the U.K. tax legislation and a related non-cash adjustment to deferred tax liabilities. This was delayed, contributing to better-than-expected EPS and is now expected to happen in Q3. So we would now expect a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the high 20s for Q3, while our expectations for the full year remains in the 22% to 24% range. Third is free cash flow, which is up significantly versus the prior year on a year-to-date basis. This has been driven by a combination of EBITDA growth, lower working capital, somewhat lower capital expenditure, as well as significantly greater accrued liabilities due to the timing of cash outflows versus the prior year. Looking forward, we expect working capital to revert as we rebuild our inventories. And cash outlays related to accrued liabilities for taxes, trade spend and marketing are second half weighted this year. In addition, we continue to plan for CapEx in roughly $750 million this year, although we have had some delays so far this year and may not spend the full plan. Taking all of this into account, we do feel good about the quality of our free cash generation year-to-date and are confident that 2020 free cash flow will exceed in 2019, which brings me to our financial outlook. I think it's helpful to come back to the fact that we are in the first year of our multi-year turnaround. The current environment has presented us with opportunities to be there for our consumers. And to the extent we are successful now, it puts a wind at the back of our turnaround efforts, and we will be in a stronger position on a sustainable basis in the future. To that point, we do expect the upside in results we have posted during the first half of the year, both sales and EBITDA to stick for the full year. And while there is still significant work to do ahead of us, we believe that we are very well positioned with each of the 3 priorities we set for 2020: to establish a strong base of sales and earnings, to rebuild underlying business momentum and continue to reduce debt while maintaining our current dividend. That being said, I think it's important to highlight the key drivers that work in the second half of the year as we establish that strong base of sales and earnings and work to rebuild our underlying business momentum. Specifically, we see four discrete factors, the same four we have talked about before that will hold back second half EBITDA versus the prior year. One, is the McCafe exit that has been underway in Canada and began in the United States in July. Two, is the high incentive compensation we mentioned on our prior call. Three, is greater commodity volatility we had warned about in April, and we now expect will result in an unfavorable key commodity costs in Q3, specifically in our U.S. Cheese business. And four, is currency translation due to dollar strength relative to last year. Together, these factors currently represent an approximately 900 basis point headwind to second half adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. That's greater than the 700 basis point headwind we were expecting when we last spoke at the end of April. And we expect slightly more of this pressure to fall in Q3 than Q4. During the first half of the year, incremental consumer demand more than offset these headwinds. From where we stand today, we are anticipating organic growth will moderate, and the favorable mix we saw in Q2 will fade. As a result, in terms of adjusted constant currency EBITDA, we currently expect organic gains in the 900 basis points of discrete headwinds I just outlined to essentially offset one another in the second half of the year. The other part of establishing our base comes from the low EBITDA, where for the full year, we continue to expect a roughly $0.38 headwind from the combination of lower other income, a higher effective tax rate and higher stock-based compensation versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we'll be seeing roughly $0.19 of the $0.38, so the second half should see another $0.19 of pressure versus the prior year. As for our third priority for 2020 to continue to reduce debt, while maintaining our current dividend, we have made great progress and are well positioned going forward. Through July, we have now fully paid the $1 billion of our 2020 debt maturities with cash, reducing our gross debt outstanding. We fully repaid our precautionary revolver draw down at the end of Q2 and $5 million remains available to us. And we are an extremely strong liquidity position with more than $2 billion of cash on hand, no meaningful refinancing needs for the next 5 years as a result of our leverage-neutral standard and refinancing transaction in May, and we simplified our capital structure, eliminating any remaining secured debt. So a very strong position to continue reducing our debt, while maintaining our current dividend. Finally, I would also like to note that with the filing of this quarter's 10-Q, we expect to have remediated our previous material weakness identified in our 10-K we filed in June last year. In summary, we have had stronger than expected results through the first half of the year. Solid execution across the company keeps us cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. And as Miguel said, our business transformation is well underway, employee morale is strong, we have a well-defined strategy, and our team is in place, working together with speed to bring agility with scale. Now, we would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris, your line is open. Chris, if your line is muted, can you please unmute it? Do you want me to go ahead and on to the next question?\nChris Jakubik: Yes. Let's go to the next question, we can come back to him.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Good morning everyone. So, great results in Q2. I guess, just to start kind of more broadly, as we think forward with respect to the turnaround. Now, obviously, there's been this tailwind, which is in place, which is great. But I guess if we think about later this year and then into next year and the go forward, this is probably more for Miguel, excuse me. How are you thinking now about specific brand strength and actual media spend reallocation? And then also just maybe further simplification of the portfolio, right? It sounds like you got to see some at-home lift in certain categories versus other more so, certain capacity constraints in certain categories versus more so, which would lead me to believe that you're able to kind of see maybe where you think you can more effectively compete, right, and get a higher lift off of further spend in some categories versus others. So, I'll just ask that and pass it on. Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Look, near-term, we are adjusting our content and delivery to reflect the greater household penetration and the new consumers that are rediscovering our brands and Carlos mentioned a little bit about that. But that is absolutely critical. I wanted to say it's critical. We are learning about who these new consumers are and that is our obsession at the moment, is to keep them with us. They are new consumers and they are repeating the purchase of our products. We cannot miss this opportunity. It's an unbelievable opportunity. I would say it's almost a sampling opportunity that we are having. And we have to keep these consumers with us. Beyond this, you are going to see us reorient around how consumers think to a few specific platforms that are globally relevant. In other words, we're going to share with you in September more choices and where we believe, we have a chance to accelerate big time our growth and giving the portfolio a role for different products for sure. Some will have a role of bringing more profitability and will have a role of growing net sales. At this moment, or until now, we never had this very clear.  And so I think that, at the same time -- and that is why we are right now increasing, as Carlos mentioned, media in the second half to put more steam behind brands that we saw big household penetration growth. At the same time, we are making a big change in marketing overall the company. We just hired 3 new Heads of Marketing for each one of our geographic zones. We are changing and evolving. We want to be much more consumer-centric. We want to be much better in marketing and in consumer insight, in innovation, in communication and this transformation and this change is happening as we speak. And that's very exciting -- it's very exciting for the entire commercial organization that is seeing this evolution coming very fast.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Super, thank you so much.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: Next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning. \nMiguel Patricio: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Growe: Just so excited for that first question, I lost the line there, so sorry for that. I wanted to go back to some discussion you had, Paulo, around EBITDA growth for the second half of the year. You did talk about some of the drags you have on EBITDA growth, the commodities, McCaf\u00e9, foreign exchange. And I think you gave some sort of offsets to that, if you will for the second half. So I wanted to just go back to that kind of discussion and what's going to offset some of those drags in EBITDA growth, number one. And then to understand like have you pushed marketing in the second half of the year? To what degree will that be kind of a further burden on the second half? And then what is marketing doing for the year and perhaps in relation to where you started your expectations for the year?\nPaulo Basilio: Hi Chris. So yes, so let's start from the last point. So as Carlos said, we are going to have a higher media spend, we're going to increase vesper year in the second half. Overall, in terms of marketing, total spend and the way that we've been planning to that, market is not going to be a significant drag for the second half of the year, okay, for us. I think the main area is that -- the main headwinds that we're going to have in our EBITDA are pretty much the four that I mentioned, like -- the same four items that we mentioned like end of last year, beginning of this year. That is pretty much incentive compensation, so variable compensation, when we compare versus prior year. Also, we are seeing a more unfavorable commodity cost, mainly in cheese with this recent volatility that we saw in the price of the commodity, the exit of McCaf\u00e9 and FX, right? So those are the -- those four compounds, the majority, the key headwinds that we see for the second half of the year. And in terms of offset, we still expect a strong -- we're still seeing a strong demand for the second half. I think we're operating much better in our mix, and also in our supply chain efforts that we're seeing. We also think it's going to be some areas of when you compare versus prior year. For example, supply chain losses, many other areas of the organization that we are evolving will be offsetting. We expect to offset these headwinds that we have. So again, sales mix, the pricing progress that we have, supply chain performance, I think, will be offsetting the headwinds that I've mentioned. Marketing is not -- should not be material for us when you compare to these other factors.\nMiguel Patricio: Just complementing what Paolo said, Chris, so we do not create confusion. Carlos mentioned a big increase in media in the second half, but we'll compensate that big increase with reduction on other parts of the marketing investment. It shouldn't be material to market increase. But what consumers see, which is media, it will be material.\nChris Growe: That's great. Just a quick follow-up. Are you pricing to some of the commodity changes you're seeing right now? Is this an environment where you're doing that? Or is it simply managed via promotional spending, which has been down?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: So in terms of overall, the company think about this commodity that is happening, we had some price. And you saw this in the beginning of the year; we had some price initiatives that we had to prepare for the year. And we, of course, our price strategy to commerce to follow the market. We also, as we said before, and as we mentioned in the call, we expect to have a more normal merchandising in the second half, that's what we saw in Q2. But we'll be operating in line with what is going to be the market for this commerce that we're seeing.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. So if I was going to add something to what Paulo said, it simply is the pressure that we're seeing on the natural cheese. It really is a short-term thing because of the government program. But if we go into the second half, we -- there may be a small amount of unfavorable in our commodity, but something that we feel that we can handle as we go forward.\nChris Growe: Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Driscoll with DD Research.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Thank you. Good morning.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nDavid Driscoll: So I had two questions I wanted to ask. The first one was just on the capacity constraints. What are you doing to address these constraints? When do you think you'll see relief on some of the key constraints? And then was there any ballpark estimate you had on what those constraints theoretically cost you in the quarter? Could you have seen another three or four percentage points of revenue growth, if not for the supply constraints?\nPaulo Basilio: Let me start with the perspective in the U.S. So essentially, what we saw was some isolated capacity constraint on certain products. And if you think about areas like Kraft Singles and Mac and Cheese cobs, and no surprising some of our pork and beef based meats. Now we're working to mitigate those near-term capacity constraints, both in terms of their supply side and the demand side. So on the supply side, I'll tell you, listen, our employees have shown incredible dedication, adding weekends and overtime shifts, and we're securing more capacity with external manufacturers and we're also fast-tracking CapEx projects to improve even more our throughput. So moving forward, we actually have projects underway that we're going to reduce our downtime, reprioritize our CapEx and build additional raw material inventory. Now on the demand side, we've also rebalanced all of our merchandising, promotion, our marketing through the lens of that available capacity. And we are making sure that we safeguard our customer service to our \u2013 to the best of our ability. And I would say, to the end of your question, I will say, it's really difficult to quantify the impact of that, but I feel good as we stand here as we go into the second half.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. And then if I could just follow-up on one other item. I just want to say, it sounds like on a longer-term basis, all the things that are happening now in terms of the advantages of this demand from the consumers, combined with the reprioritization of your objectives, and I know you're going to lay out a lot more in September, but it just sounds like what you're saying in the future is that there doesn't need to be a significant earnings reset in 2021 and beyond, that you can go from here, reprioritize where you're putting your investments and get Kraft on a sustainable growth trajectory. This is a little bit of a \u2013 I'm trying to tease out maybe a little bit of what you might say in September, but are you willing to agree with my comment? Am I interpreting you correctly?\nMiguel Patricio: Look, David, we've said that we expect to find efficiencies to pay for the necessary investments. This quarter is a great example of that. We had significant increase in supply costs in overtime, in bonus to employees, in PPES, hygiene, temperature checks. But even with all these increases, we were able to mitigate these costs and cost of goods sold. You can see they were very, very good. And so we remain confident that this will be the case. We'll give you more transparency, more details in September, but that's the way that we are working moving forward.\nDavid Driscoll: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just \u2013 I wanted to come back to the U.S. and Carlos, you referenced being prepared to deal with any sort of path the economic recovery may hand you. And in that vein, how do you think about the portfolio of barbell strategy in terms of premium versus opening price points? In what parts of the U.S. portfolio, do you think you have the most premium opportunities in terms of development going forward? And then at the low end, the opening price point, how is the supply chain now in terms of being able to meet that demand at margins with minimal dilution, let's say?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: John, thanks for the question. Let me \u2013 I guess, part of where I will start with is \u2013 let's put COVID aside for a second and I think getting to where your point is, which is what we see in the current economic pressures. Ultimately, that's going to be consumers, how they're going to be purchasing will be a function of basically how the economy is going to drop and how much time it will take to recover. Now both of those things, at this point, it's really hard to know how that's going to sort out. When we look back to some of the -- in the past of our recessions, whether that was in the U.S. in 2001, 2008 and 2009, our portfolio organic growth remain essentially largely consistent with what we saw pre the recession performance with the exception of foodservice. In foodservice, we actually saw a decline across both recessions because of the lower foot traffic in restaurants. So that takes me, I think, to your question of where do we stand today? What I would say is, I think we're well positioned. I think we have good momentum in the household penetration, as I mentioned. We are in better positioned on the promotional front end as we go into the second half of the year where we can invest back into our brands. And the investment is not just on the promotional event. As I mentioned earlier, we are also investing back in media. So we are seeing a 40% grade investment in the second half as we go into closing the year. So I think that from what we have learned and where we are today, I feel good about where we are.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. And then just in terms of the write-downs taken in the quarter, there was also some commentary regarding increases in fair value estimates in other areas across the business. Can you walk through the areas of positive revisions and maybe elaborate a bit on the reference to recalibrating future investments going forward? Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: No. Sure. I think when you look at -- we have many areas in our portfolio and that the values get ended up moving up, as I mentioned in the call, in areas like the value went down, the exercise that you do. And I guess, it's important to remember that listen, we do this annual test every year in Q2. And as you mentioned, we saw many areas in our portfolio that are doing now and have better strategy, and we expect to get, for example, our condiment and sauce portfolio across the globe, including the US, some meals portfolios that we have. We saw these reporting units going up even in escalated part of the business unit. Also, we have -- we saw some value increases. And the areas that we really -- the reporting units that went down was pretty much related to Canada, foodservice and retail, and also the food service in the US. But those are pretty much the areas that we saw ups and downs in terms of our impairment exercise.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay, thanks for your time.\nMiguel Patricio: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You mentioned that you expect more normalized merchandising levels in the second half. Would we hear that correctly to mean that you don't really have any need to pay back the savings from less promotional spending in the second quarter, or would be more normalized levels, maybe even have a little tick up to sort of smooth out the year?\nPaulo Basilio: Let me -- I guess I could take that question. When you look at our promotional activity, as we think about second half, what I would say is, right now, both our inventories or production levels, as they are improving, we are, in fact, going to be able to put some additional promotion activity in Q3. In fact, you'll see that in our first dry period, which is a big dry per happens around Labor Day. So we'll see that in our brands and categories. Well, we have -- so far, what we have been able to do is we have been able to be very surgical about pulling back on promotions. And you saw some of that in the scanner data, but that really has been very focused on certain categories. Now, in going forward, our focus continues to be, is making sure that we service demand because we know there is still a significant amount of pull there from our consumer base. So, we're going to -- yes, we're going to be building back our promotions. But at the same time, I feel like we're doing it in a balanced way as we are now being able to support those businesses that do have the dry level of inventory.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's great. Thank you. And just one more looking ahead, as you start to plan for 2021, clearly, there's lots of uncertainty, but what's your planning stance as far as elevated demand levels? And do you anticipate that carrying into next year? And are you planning for that accordingly?\nMiguel Patricio: Look, as you said, it's very hard to anticipate the demand for 2021. I can tell you that we've been working on a lot of scenarios and building scenarios. The truth is that we -- at the same time, the same way that you, I'm sure, do not see a solution for the coronavirus in the short-term or -- and so we have to work with scenarios. I think that the best thing that we can do is to concentrate our energy and resources on really holding onto these new households that we gained. It is critical. This is a blast that we have new consumers trying, experimenting, repeating the trial and has to be our obsession to keep them with us so we can, in 2021, progress. If the pandemic continues in 2021, and we'll continue with that and that will play in our favor. If not, we have a base of consumers that is higher than we had before and they tried and they continue trying, they continue consuming, and we want them with us. We continue to carry out the strategy that we've set and look for additional and continuous improvement opportunities in everything we do. I think that one thing that is critical for us is that we are starting to share with our customers at this moment plannings already for what's going to happen in next year, and we'll start this now in the second half of the year. And that is crucial. We are -- we've been able to anticipate the planning cycle for the future, which will -- is very important both for us and for our customers.\nMichael Lavery: That's helpful color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital.\nScott Mushkin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my ques. So, I wanted to look at the third quarter just for a second. I know you said you're expecting things to kind of, I guess, slow down a little bit. And I was wondering, we're seeing, especially in the U.S., a resurgence of corona cases. And I know the retailers are seeing still very, very strong sales. So, I was wondering if you could maybe flush out a little bit why you think things are going to really take a step back in 3Q as far as sales in the U.S.?\nMiguel Patricio: No, listen. So, I can take that, maybe after Carlos can also build if needed. But again, at the end of the day, when we compare our Q3 expectations for Q2, we saw already inside Q2 the deceleration from the retail side of the business. We \u2013 on top of that, we also are seeing like a foodservice kind of recovering and offsetting part of this decline of the retail. We have McCafe also started playing. The exit of McCafe is also going to start impacting us. So, again, those are pretty much the deceleration effectors in sales that we're seeing for Q3 and second half versus the first half, the normal deceleration from the retail side. And the McCafe, they start playing out also \u2013 the exit of McCafe in the U.S. start impacting us in July. Margin-wise, when you talk about EBITDA that was the comment I made, I think there are two big components, right? One component is mix. I think the mix benefits that we saw in Q2 will fade, both because of the relative retail foodservice channel mix. And also, the category product level mix gains that we are expecting to see going forward versus what we saw in Q2. And the price relative to commodity, as I mentioned, with the spike mainly in the cheese cost that we're seeing this happen in Q3 versus what we had in Q2, that was a benefit for us. But those are the main drivers that we were seeing in terms of relative performance, year-over-year performance, year to go versus what we saw in the first half.\nScott Mushkin: Okay, great. And as a quick follow-up. I was wondering, maybe you don't want to talk about this yet, but \u2013 maybe it's for September, but any thoughts on the innovation pipeline? You touched on it that you wanted to accelerate innovation and renovation, any further comments there? And then I'll yield. Thanks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me \u2013 I guess, a comment on the innovation piece, and you're right. You're going to hear quite a bit more about our plans in September. So look forward to seeing you then. But I would tell you is that, I think, when we think about 2020, really, the impact has been kind of limited in terms of what we have seen and changing our plans of innovation. We \u2013 if you recall, we are actually, in 2020, have half the projects that we had a year ago. So we actually didn't see as much of an impact because of the changes. As we go to 2021, we'll be going to a little detail in September, but I can tell you that we're going to be focused on fewer, bigger innovation. And the good news is that, our R&D facilities actually have been open for about six, seven weeks. So actually, we feel very good about our pipeline as we go into next year. And I'm looking forward to kind of share with you the details of how that's going to come to live in September. Thank you.\nScott Mushkin: Okay, guys. Thanks very much.\nChris Jakubik: I think we can take one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. A question on pricing net of commodities and also on market share and maybe how those are playing against each other. It looked like your pricing net of commodities was a positive in the second quarter specifically in cheese. We saw those prices low for much of the quarter. And you mentioned that cheese was flipping to a headwind and is one of the reasons why the EBITDA headwinds would be created. Is that simply because of the fact that we've seen the dairy spike in June into July here? Or is there some other reinvestment needed? I ask that because cheese, like some of your other commodity-oriented categories, you've had some sustained market share losses for a while. And I'm wondering if you're not just seeing a cycle reason, but perhaps you're drawing a line in the sand about market share in some of these categories and you're making a decision to defend on market share? Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: I'll take that. I think the question is probably more about the U.S. So I guess I would say is let me start by -- I think the point that we have made earlier, but I'll revisit, which is our focus really is on driving household penetration and retaining all those new consumers that are coming to our brands. Now in the context of that market share specifically, what I would say is there's been -- the way I see it, there's been like three moments since the COVID began. I think there was an initial moment, in which the demand really spite and we had high levels of inventory, which is normal what we do at that time of year. So that actually helped us gain share. Now when we saw demand stay high through May and into June, we also wanted to make sure we better manage our service levels. So we actually lost some share in certain categories. And as I mentioned earlier, we pulled back on promotions in places like Memorial Day, which we have never done. We also focused our SKUs in our core businesses, so that we can maximize our throughput. That also had an impact on share as you think about the distribution. And then we also had to respond to the fact that there was some supply tightness across the value chain and from end-to-end in places like meat and in some parts of our -- mostly in pork and beef business. Now today, what I'll tell you is our retail demand remains strong. So we are -- because of the -- we're focused on areas that we can actually control. And let me tell you the three things we're doing. One, we're bolstering capacity to make sure that we get more of our assets and we are expanding our number of co-packers. That seem to be working. Now because of that, we are actually then expanding number of SKUs back into our shelves where customers really need them. And the third thing is we're also going back to investing. I mentioned we're investing back in promotional events in the second half and investing back in media as we go into the second half. So when you take these actions, the reality is that we're actually seeing progress. In fact, our share over the last two weeks have been positive, and we see that some improvement as we go forward. So when you take it all together, what I'll say is, our focus for our entire team is how do we make sure, as we go into the second half, we maintain the positive momentum in the business and we focus on connecting with our new and effecting consumers.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Miguel for any closing remarks. \nMiguel Patricio: Well, I wanted to thank you for all the time you've been on this call with us. And before finishing, I just want to summarize the way that we are seeing this quarter and moving forward. We, for sure, had stronger than expected Q2 results. And that reflected -- is reflecting our continued momentum and the strong consumer demand for our brands, and we are very excited with that. We had a strong category and brand growth on household penetration -- coming from household penetration, but also from repeat rates. We had better than anticipated costs and supply chain. And that's despite the fact that we had a big inflation, big cost increase because of the COVID. And now for 2020, our priorities and our actions are on track. And the results will be better than anticipated. We expect this first half upside to hold. And solid execution is making us cautiously optimistic for the second half. There's a lot of uncertainty. Are kids going back-to-school or not? Are we going to open our offices or not? This can change still a lot. But if the consumption stays strong, yes, we may have an upside on the second half. The other thing is, at the same time that we are dealing with this unprecedented change in consumption partners, and we've been adapting very fast, we are working on parallel on our transformation. Our transformation is underway. And in the \u2013 still in the early stages of bringing the agility to our company, we have a lean structure, a culture based on ownership, which is a critical ingredient for agility. And yes, we have to correct other things, but we are excited about bringing agility to the company that has the scale that we have. I think that together with the scale of our business, we are going to bring a benefit to our shareholders, to our customers and to our consumers. And looking forward, we are looking forward to provide you with more details on our strategy, priorities and initiatives and our new operating model during our virtual Investor Day on September 15. So thank you very much, and see you soon or talk to you soon.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I think it's appropriate to start today by saying that more than anything else, the strength of our second quarter results reflect the hard work and dedication of our remarkable employees around the world. Without them, we would not have reported numbers anywhere near what you saw in our press release today. On our April call, I said that the coming months would be critical in understanding the path forward and potential for our industry for Kraft Heinz and the pace of our turnaround. Three months later, I can tell you that while the path of the economy and consumer behavior remains difficult for any of us to predict, our team has done an excellent work, anticipating and responding with speed, agility and creativity. And we can see this in the quality of our second quarter results. More importantly, we continue to make great progress on our turnaround. Our people are driving functional excellence throughout the organization. We are developing better perspectives on where consumers are going and how we can win. Our productivity initiatives are progressing and strong free cash flow is further improving our financial profile. All these things are coming through in what we will cover today in our business update, where we will talk about how we are adapting to consumer needs, to Q2 results that were much stronger-than-expected, due to continued momentum and strong consumer demand for our brands, as well as better-than-anticipated costs and supply chain performance and the fact that our solid execution is keeping us cautiously optimistic for the rest of the year. Carlos and I will begin today with how our business has responded so far and our current thoughts about the path forward, before Paolo discusses the financials and then we'll take your questions. The first chart I wanted to share is our underlying year-on-year sales growth by geography, in both retail and foodservice channels. It shows the progression from Q1 to the April spike to the May-June settling out period. There are three important points to take away from this chart. First, it's the tremendous and abrupt shift in consumer behavior that we are witnessing. These are sales of the food and beverage products, not microchips. So to describe the magnitude of this channel shift as unprecedented feels like; an understatement. Second, the numbers in the chart are Kraft Heinz sales, not the broader market, not the broader categories where we play. And it's important to recognize that our supply chain capabilities are largely split between capacity to produce and service retail sales and producing and servicing food service sales. There is little overlap in terms of production lines and route to market. So what this chart reflects is that, during this period we have been able to successfully adapt to such an abrupt unprecedented change in consumer behavior. Keep everyone of our plants around the world up and running, producing at industry-leading quality and safety levels and therefore enable us to deliver more than 7% organic net sales growth in Q2. This is not to say that, we capture 100% of the opportunity. As you know, there are some categories where we have lost share and we are working hard to fix that. That said, I have seen the creativity and agility our teams around the world have demonstrated in meeting peak demand. Learning through the journey, as we like to call it and ultimately, delivering roughly twice the organic growth we expected in April, which brings me to the third point; the source of Q2 upside, versus our previous expectations. The decline we saw in foodservice sales on a global basis was largely consistent with what we had forecasted, somewhat better in the U.S. and at a softer end of the range in our international business. At the same time, our retail performance was much better than anticipated. In the United States, which Carlos will speak to, in our international zone where in condiments and sauces, we grew double digits and in several markets, achieved record market share. And in Canada, where we had double-digit growth and gained share in 80% of our retail categories as the team invested to strengthen brand relevancy in areas like peanut butter, pasta sauce and Kraft dinners. In addition, what is not shown on this chart, but we will discuss later, is the extraordinary retail sales growth came with favorable category and product mix. Together, the combination of favorable channel, category and product mix resulted in better-than-expected EBITDA margins versus what we originally expected, most notable in our United States business. At the same time and the second part of the business update, it's important to reiterate that we remain at the beginning stages of our turnaround and are still not where we want to be on several fronts, which we will talk about in great detail in September. We have done a lot to adapt to the pandemic, but we are also implementing a new operating model to improve our performance on a sustainable basis. We are making significant changes to how we work, how we are organizing our business, how we are developing our capabilities, and how we are reinvesting in the business. Our actions have been broad-based with the intent to create sustainable competitive advantage across our value chain. For instance, we have continued to work urgently and diligently to ensure the health and safety of our employees, taking on additional costs for personal protective equipment in our plants, as well as to accommodate working from home. At the same time, during the second quarter, we rolled out our new company purpose, vision, values and leadership principles. We are redefining for our employees for the long-term our true north and how we are going to win by working as a team, inspiring excellence and navigate our future. I want to specifically mention, one of our company values. We demand diversity. We live in a world where systemic racism and inequality exists. And writing these wrongs requires an equally systemic response from everyone, including global corporations like ours. We have a responsibility to be part of the solution. Honest conversations with our African-American Business Resource Group led to a range of initiatives, including a $1 million commitment to food programs and social justice organizations serving black communities, as well as our first Global Day of Service on June 10 last month. From internal mentoring and developing programs and expanded talent recruitment partnerships, to supplier training programs for minority and women owned businesses, and the creation of a cross-functional inclusion council, we are proactive and hold ourselves and our company accountable for bringing about the positive change. Changing times demand fresh, new approaches. For consumers, we are actively modeling multiple growth scenarios and defining new initiatives to adapt to each scenario. At the same time, we have now reorganized our business units around new consumer-led platforms, so we can better address our consumers. With our customers and in-marketing, on improving communications today, but also how we deploy our resources to drive growth going forward. With customers specifically, collaboration has been key, as we are creatively addressing immediate customer needs on one hand while simultaneously trying to set plans for the coming year. In supply chain, the difference a year has made is simply incredible. We are finding efficiency to mitigate incremental COVID costs, while taking actions to optimize and ensure production. At the same time, we continue to implement continuous improvement processes and programs for sustainable savings for the years to come. In many ways, we are leveraging our intentional strategic changes to better respond to an environment with significant uncertainty. As a result, I'm confident that we'll emerge a stronger Kraft Heinz. And the strategic direction we have set is the right one and one that we look forward to discussing in detail with you on September 15. I will close my opening comments here by summarizing a few points. We had stronger-than-expected Q2 results, reflecting continued momentum and strong consumer demand for our brands. We are implementing our new enterprise-wide strategy at the same time we are adapting to the pandemic. After a year as CEO, I can see our business transformation well underway, with strong employee model, a well-defined strategy and a team in place, working together with speed to bring agility with scale. And our work to-date has only confirmed that we are on the right path. To bring this more to life, I'm going to ask Carlos to provide more color on how our U.S. business is performing in the marketplace and how he sees the path forward. Okay. Look, near-term, we are adjusting our content and delivery to reflect the greater household penetration and the new consumers that are rediscovering our brands and Carlos mentioned a little bit about that. But that is absolutely critical. I wanted to say it's critical. We are learning about who these new consumers are and that is our obsession at the moment, is to keep them with us. They are new consumers and they are repeating the purchase of our products. We cannot miss this opportunity. It's an unbelievable opportunity. I would say it's almost a sampling opportunity that we are having. And we have to keep these consumers with us. Beyond this, you are going to see us reorient around how consumers think to a few specific platforms that are globally relevant. In other words, we're going to share with you in September more choices and where we believe, we have a chance to accelerate big time our growth and giving the portfolio a role for different products for sure. Some will have a role of bringing more profitability and will have a role of growing net sales. At this moment, or until now, we never had this very clear.  And so I think that, at the same time -- and that is why we are right now increasing, as Carlos mentioned, media in the second half to put more steam behind brands that we saw big household penetration growth. At the same time, we are making a big change in marketing overall the company. We just hired 3 new Heads of Marketing for each one of our geographic zones. We are changing and evolving. We want to be much more consumer-centric. We want to be much better in marketing and in consumer insight, in innovation, in communication and this transformation and this change is happening as we speak. And that's very exciting -- it's very exciting for the entire commercial organization that is seeing this evolution coming very fast. Thank you, Rob. Good morning, Chris. Just complementing what Paolo said, Chris, so we do not create confusion. Carlos mentioned a big increase in media in the second half, but we'll compensate that big increase with reduction on other parts of the marketing investment. It shouldn't be material to market increase. But what consumers see, which is media, it will be material. Okay. So if I was going to add something to what Paulo said, it simply is the pressure that we're seeing on the natural cheese. It really is a short-term thing because of the government program. But if we go into the second half, we -- there may be a small amount of unfavorable in our commodity, but something that we feel that we can handle as we go forward. Thank you. Good morning. Look, David, we've said that we expect to find efficiencies to pay for the necessary investments. This quarter is a great example of that. We had significant increase in supply costs in overtime, in bonus to employees, in PPES, hygiene, temperature checks. But even with all these increases, we were able to mitigate these costs and cost of goods sold. You can see they were very, very good. And so we remain confident that this will be the case. We'll give you more transparency, more details in September, but that's the way that we are working moving forward. No. Sure. I think when you look at -- we have many areas in our portfolio and that the values get ended up moving up, as I mentioned in the call, in areas like the value went down, the exercise that you do. And I guess, it's important to remember that listen, we do this annual test every year in Q2. And as you mentioned, we saw many areas in our portfolio that are doing now and have better strategy, and we expect to get, for example, our condiment and sauce portfolio across the globe, including the US, some meals portfolios that we have. We saw these reporting units going up even in escalated part of the business unit. Also, we have -- we saw some value increases. And the areas that we really -- the reporting units that went down was pretty much related to Canada, foodservice and retail, and also the food service in the US. But those are pretty much the areas that we saw ups and downs in terms of our impairment exercise. Welcome. Good morning. Look, as you said, it's very hard to anticipate the demand for 2021. I can tell you that we've been working on a lot of scenarios and building scenarios. The truth is that we -- at the same time, the same way that you, I'm sure, do not see a solution for the coronavirus in the short-term or -- and so we have to work with scenarios. I think that the best thing that we can do is to concentrate our energy and resources on really holding onto these new households that we gained. It is critical. This is a blast that we have new consumers trying, experimenting, repeating the trial and has to be our obsession to keep them with us so we can, in 2021, progress. If the pandemic continues in 2021, and we'll continue with that and that will play in our favor. If not, we have a base of consumers that is higher than we had before and they tried and they continue trying, they continue consuming, and we want them with us. We continue to carry out the strategy that we've set and look for additional and continuous improvement opportunities in everything we do. I think that one thing that is critical for us is that we are starting to share with our customers at this moment plannings already for what's going to happen in next year, and we'll start this now in the second half of the year. And that is crucial. We are -- we've been able to anticipate the planning cycle for the future, which will -- is very important both for us and for our customers. No, listen. So, I can take that, maybe after Carlos can also build if needed. But again, at the end of the day, when we compare our Q3 expectations for Q2, we saw already inside Q2 the deceleration from the retail side of the business. We \u2013 on top of that, we also are seeing like a foodservice kind of recovering and offsetting part of this decline of the retail. We have McCafe also started playing. The exit of McCafe is also going to start impacting us. So, again, those are pretty much the deceleration effectors in sales that we're seeing for Q3 and second half versus the first half, the normal deceleration from the retail side. And the McCafe, they start playing out also \u2013 the exit of McCafe in the U.S. start impacting us in July. Margin-wise, when you talk about EBITDA that was the comment I made, I think there are two big components, right? One component is mix. I think the mix benefits that we saw in Q2 will fade, both because of the relative retail foodservice channel mix. And also, the category product level mix gains that we are expecting to see going forward versus what we saw in Q2. And the price relative to commodity, as I mentioned, with the spike mainly in the cheese cost that we're seeing this happen in Q3 versus what we had in Q2, that was a benefit for us. But those are the main drivers that we were seeing in terms of relative performance, year-over-year performance, year to go versus what we saw in the first half. I'll take that. I think the question is probably more about the U.S. So I guess I would say is let me start by -- I think the point that we have made earlier, but I'll revisit, which is our focus really is on driving household penetration and retaining all those new consumers that are coming to our brands. Now in the context of that market share specifically, what I would say is there's been -- the way I see it, there's been like three moments since the COVID began. I think there was an initial moment, in which the demand really spite and we had high levels of inventory, which is normal what we do at that time of year. So that actually helped us gain share. Now when we saw demand stay high through May and into June, we also wanted to make sure we better manage our service levels. So we actually lost some share in certain categories. And as I mentioned earlier, we pulled back on promotions in places like Memorial Day, which we have never done. We also focused our SKUs in our core businesses, so that we can maximize our throughput. That also had an impact on share as you think about the distribution. And then we also had to respond to the fact that there was some supply tightness across the value chain and from end-to-end in places like meat and in some parts of our -- mostly in pork and beef business. Now today, what I'll tell you is our retail demand remains strong. So we are -- because of the -- we're focused on areas that we can actually control. And let me tell you the three things we're doing. One, we're bolstering capacity to make sure that we get more of our assets and we are expanding our number of co-packers. That seem to be working. Now because of that, we are actually then expanding number of SKUs back into our shelves where customers really need them. And the third thing is we're also going back to investing. I mentioned we're investing back in promotional events in the second half and investing back in media as we go into the second half. So when you take these actions, the reality is that we're actually seeing progress. In fact, our share over the last two weeks have been positive, and we see that some improvement as we go forward. So when you take it all together, what I'll say is, our focus for our entire team is how do we make sure, as we go into the second half, we maintain the positive momentum in the business and we focus on connecting with our new and effecting consumers. Thank you. Well, I wanted to thank you for all the time you've been on this call with us. And before finishing, I just want to summarize the way that we are seeing this quarter and moving forward. We, for sure, had stronger than expected Q2 results. And that reflected -- is reflecting our continued momentum and the strong consumer demand for our brands, and we are very excited with that. We had a strong category and brand growth on household penetration -- coming from household penetration, but also from repeat rates. We had better than anticipated costs and supply chain. And that's despite the fact that we had a big inflation, big cost increase because of the COVID. And now for 2020, our priorities and our actions are on track. And the results will be better than anticipated. We expect this first half upside to hold. And solid execution is making us cautiously optimistic for the second half. There's a lot of uncertainty. Are kids going back-to-school or not? Are we going to open our offices or not? This can change still a lot. But if the consumption stays strong, yes, we may have an upside on the second half. The other thing is, at the same time that we are dealing with this unprecedented change in consumption partners, and we've been adapting very fast, we are working on parallel on our transformation. Our transformation is underway. And in the \u2013 still in the early stages of bringing the agility to our company, we have a lean structure, a culture based on ownership, which is a critical ingredient for agility. And yes, we have to correct other things, but we are excited about bringing agility to the company that has the scale that we have. I think that together with the scale of our business, we are going to bring a benefit to our shareholders, to our customers and to our consumers. And looking forward, we are looking forward to provide you with more details on our strategy, priorities and initiatives and our new operating model during our virtual Investor Day on September 15. So thank you very much, and see you soon or talk to you soon."

            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Thank you Carlos and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of our results, I think it's useful to outline some overall key drivers of the quarter that were consistent across our different segments. On our April call, I outlined 4 factors we expected to drive better profitability in Q2 versus Q1. One, was improved product mix, mainly from categories within retail as well as a favorable shift between retail and foodservice. Two, higher volumes. Three, greater efficiency in operations as we were adjusting to the higher volumes. And four, a better balance between price and commodity costs. In the end, all these factors came into play and were directionally consistent with our expectations. What pushed our growth and profitability higher than anticipated was a combination of stronger retail demand for longer than we anticipated, a better than projected relationship between price and commodity costs and a more favorable category and product mix within our retail sales. These factors were most pronounced in our U.S. business. So that's where I will start. Organic net sales in the U.S. increased 8.5%. This was mainly driven by 6.2 percentage points of volume/mix growth, led by the strong retail performance Carlos described. Pricing was up, as it reflected lower promotional activity to capacity constraints in certain categories. Taken together, volume leverage, favorable canine product mix, as well as favorable pricing, adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter increased 17.6%. Specifically regarding mix, we saw favorable category mix in the form of relatively stronger demand and market share performance in areas like ketchup and condiments, mac and cheese and frozen potatoes. We also saw favorable SKU mix within categories due to supply chain constraints and, therefore, greater sales of core items within our product lines. Looking forward, we are not anticipating retail demand to remain as strong as we saw in Q2 and likely to moderate further from recent levels with category mix normalizing and foodservice being a greater part of total sales. In addition, keep in mind that the McCafe\u0301 exit is now underway and will, therefore, tamper organic growth beginning in Q3. As a result, at this point, while Q3 profits should be higher than we anticipated three months ago, Q3 margins are likely to be closer to prior year levels as organic growth moderates, the favorable mix we saw in Q2 phased and pressures from the recent spike in commodity inflation, specifically in cheese, come into play. While this would represent a significant change sequentially from Q2 to Q3, we believe it is the most realistic expectation based on the best estimates in consumption and cost trends today. Moving to our International segment. Results were largely consistent with our initial expectations, with organic net sales up 5.5% versus the prior year period and roughly equal contributions from volume mix and pricing. Pricing accelerated to 2.6% from a combination of reduced promotional activity, carryover benefits from previous pricing actions and inflation related pricing in Brazil. Volume/mix increased 2.9% from strong growth in condiment and sauces, along with growth in mill oriented categories, more than offset a decline in both foodservice and infant nutrition. Looking forward, we are expecting the deceleration we saw in growth during the second quarter to continue into Q3 as markets normalize, particularly in our biggest market in the U.K. And while the pace of normalization is unpredictable, we currently anticipate back half results, both organic sales growth and margins to soften compared to the first half. Finally is Canada, where the Q2 turnaround we anticipated was even stronger than expected. In April, we said we thought that organic sales growth would improve sequentially, but remained negative versus the prior year, given the McCafe exit, lower food service sales and lower year-on-year pricing. In the end, our Canada team delivered 2% organic growth, with pricing turning positive for the first time in seven quarters and retail consumption growth in every category. The positive pricing reflected a combination of reduced promotional activity versus the prior year, as well as successful implementation of select but necessary list price increases. Also, volume/mix was positive, as stronger-than-expected retail takeaway more than offset lower foodservice sales and a negative 4.4 percentage point impact from McCafe exit. At EBITDA, we initially expected Q2 margins to begin returning to prior year levels. Actual results were slightly better, with an adjusted EBITDA margin up nearly 30 basis points versus the prior year, as improved supply chain performance added to gains from pricing and volume/mix. For the second half of the year, we would expect the improved performance in Canada to continue, with a sustained recovery in profitability, although with more normalized retail takeaway trends being offset by the ongoing headwinds from McCafe exit and lower food service sales. Turning now to total company results and our outlook for the year. There are just three additional notes I would make on our Q2 results. First is that, each business segment reported organic sales and EBITDA growth in Q2, and we hope this indicates more stable performance across our businesses going forward. Second, our taxes. On our last call, I flagged the possibility of a higher effective tax rate in Q2, due to the possible enactment of the U.K. tax legislation and a related non-cash adjustment to deferred tax liabilities. This was delayed, contributing to better-than-expected EPS and is now expected to happen in Q3. So we would now expect a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the high 20s for Q3, while our expectations for the full year remains in the 22% to 24% range. Third is free cash flow, which is up significantly versus the prior year on a year-to-date basis. This has been driven by a combination of EBITDA growth, lower working capital, somewhat lower capital expenditure, as well as significantly greater accrued liabilities due to the timing of cash outflows versus the prior year. Looking forward, we expect working capital to revert as we rebuild our inventories. And cash outlays related to accrued liabilities for taxes, trade spend and marketing are second half weighted this year. In addition, we continue to plan for CapEx in roughly $750 million this year, although we have had some delays so far this year and may not spend the full plan. Taking all of this into account, we do feel good about the quality of our free cash generation year-to-date and are confident that 2020 free cash flow will exceed in 2019, which brings me to our financial outlook. I think it's helpful to come back to the fact that we are in the first year of our multi-year turnaround. The current environment has presented us with opportunities to be there for our consumers. And to the extent we are successful now, it puts a wind at the back of our turnaround efforts, and we will be in a stronger position on a sustainable basis in the future. To that point, we do expect the upside in results we have posted during the first half of the year, both sales and EBITDA to stick for the full year. And while there is still significant work to do ahead of us, we believe that we are very well positioned with each of the 3 priorities we set for 2020: to establish a strong base of sales and earnings, to rebuild underlying business momentum and continue to reduce debt while maintaining our current dividend. That being said, I think it's important to highlight the key drivers that work in the second half of the year as we establish that strong base of sales and earnings and work to rebuild our underlying business momentum. Specifically, we see four discrete factors, the same four we have talked about before that will hold back second half EBITDA versus the prior year. One, is the McCafe exit that has been underway in Canada and began in the United States in July. Two, is the high incentive compensation we mentioned on our prior call. Three, is greater commodity volatility we had warned about in April, and we now expect will result in an unfavorable key commodity costs in Q3, specifically in our U.S. Cheese business. And four, is currency translation due to dollar strength relative to last year. Together, these factors currently represent an approximately 900 basis point headwind to second half adjusted EBITDA growth versus the prior year. That's greater than the 700 basis point headwind we were expecting when we last spoke at the end of April. And we expect slightly more of this pressure to fall in Q3 than Q4. During the first half of the year, incremental consumer demand more than offset these headwinds. From where we stand today, we are anticipating organic growth will moderate, and the favorable mix we saw in Q2 will fade. As a result, in terms of adjusted constant currency EBITDA, we currently expect organic gains in the 900 basis points of discrete headwinds I just outlined to essentially offset one another in the second half of the year. The other part of establishing our base comes from the low EBITDA, where for the full year, we continue to expect a roughly $0.38 headwind from the combination of lower other income, a higher effective tax rate and higher stock-based compensation versus the prior year. Year-to-date, we'll be seeing roughly $0.19 of the $0.38, so the second half should see another $0.19 of pressure versus the prior year. As for our third priority for 2020 to continue to reduce debt, while maintaining our current dividend, we have made great progress and are well positioned going forward. Through July, we have now fully paid the $1 billion of our 2020 debt maturities with cash, reducing our gross debt outstanding. We fully repaid our precautionary revolver draw down at the end of Q2 and $5 million remains available to us. And we are an extremely strong liquidity position with more than $2 billion of cash on hand, no meaningful refinancing needs for the next 5 years as a result of our leverage-neutral standard and refinancing transaction in May, and we simplified our capital structure, eliminating any remaining secured debt. So a very strong position to continue reducing our debt, while maintaining our current dividend. Finally, I would also like to note that with the filing of this quarter's 10-Q, we expect to have remediated our previous material weakness identified in our 10-K we filed in June last year. In summary, we have had stronger than expected results through the first half of the year. Solid execution across the company keeps us cautiously optimistic for the balance of the year. And as Miguel said, our business transformation is well underway, employee morale is strong, we have a well-defined strategy, and our team is in place, working together with speed to bring agility with scale. Now, we would be happy to take your questions. Hi Chris. So yes, so let's start from the last point. So as Carlos said, we are going to have a higher media spend, we're going to increase vesper year in the second half. Overall, in terms of marketing, total spend and the way that we've been planning to that, market is not going to be a significant drag for the second half of the year, okay, for us. I think the main area is that -- the main headwinds that we're going to have in our EBITDA are pretty much the four that I mentioned, like -- the same four items that we mentioned like end of last year, beginning of this year. That is pretty much incentive compensation, so variable compensation, when we compare versus prior year. Also, we are seeing a more unfavorable commodity cost, mainly in cheese with this recent volatility that we saw in the price of the commodity, the exit of McCafe\u0301 and FX, right? So those are the -- those four compounds, the majority, the key headwinds that we see for the second half of the year. And in terms of offset, we still expect a strong -- we're still seeing a strong demand for the second half. I think we're operating much better in our mix, and also in our supply chain efforts that we're seeing. We also think it's going to be some areas of when you compare versus prior year. For example, supply chain losses, many other areas of the organization that we are evolving will be offsetting. We expect to offset these headwinds that we have. So again, sales mix, the pricing progress that we have, supply chain performance, I think, will be offsetting the headwinds that I've mentioned. Marketing is not -- should not be material for us when you compare to these other factors. Let me start with the perspective in the U.S. So essentially, what we saw was some isolated capacity constraint on certain products. And if you think about areas like Kraft Singles and Mac and Cheese cobs, and no surprising some of our pork and beef based meats. Now we're working to mitigate those near-term capacity constraints, both in terms of their supply side and the demand side. So on the supply side, I'll tell you, listen, our employees have shown incredible dedication, adding weekends and overtime shifts, and we're securing more capacity with external manufacturers and we're also fast-tracking CapEx projects to improve even more our throughput. So moving forward, we actually have projects underway that we're going to reduce our downtime, reprioritize our CapEx and build additional raw material inventory. Now on the demand side, we've also rebalanced all of our merchandising, promotion, our marketing through the lens of that available capacity. And we are making sure that we safeguard our customer service to our \u2013 to the best of our ability. And I would say, to the end of your question, I will say, it's really difficult to quantify the impact of that, but I feel good as we stand here as we go into the second half. Let me -- I guess I could take that question. When you look at our promotional activity, as we think about second half, what I would say is, right now, both our inventories or production levels, as they are improving, we are, in fact, going to be able to put some additional promotion activity in Q3. In fact, you'll see that in our first dry period, which is a big dry per happens around Labor Day. So we'll see that in our brands and categories. Well, we have -- so far, what we have been able to do is we have been able to be very surgical about pulling back on promotions. And you saw some of that in the scanner data, but that really has been very focused on certain categories. Now, in going forward, our focus continues to be, is making sure that we service demand because we know there is still a significant amount of pull there from our consumer base. So, we're going to -- yes, we're going to be building back our promotions. But at the same time, I feel like we're doing it in a balanced way as we are now being able to support those businesses that do have the dry level of inventory."

            "content": "Thank you, Miguel and good morning, everyone. My comments today are going to focus on what we have experienced so far, how we are preparing for the road ahead and hopefully address a number of the questions many of you have raised about our recent performance. In terms of what we have experienced, to say it's being intense, dynamic and rewarding will be an understatement. We have been working hard to optimize our manufacturing capacity to meet extraordinary demand, running some of our plants 24/7. This has caused us to cancel some programming and reallocate spending to the second half of the year. So, for instance, we had to pull back on our Memorial Day event for the first time ever. And not having that event removed the drive period in the quarter when we typically have very high market share. And average price gaps increased versus the prior year as a result. In areas like our Oscar Mayer meat and Kraft single businesses, our share has been negatively impacted by sustained elevated consumption versus supply chain constraints, while more vertically integrated players have been able to shift capacity from their foodservice businesses to retail. So while we're growing strongly in those businesses, we are seeing some share loss. Elsewhere in the portfolio, Heinz, Jell-O, Ore-Ida are gaining share, even with this accelerated consumption. In a nutshell, promotional activity and the pace of inventory recovery, both ours and our retail partners, have been dictated by the balance of supply and demand. What that means for us is, growth has been good, but in certain categories, we know we can do better. If demand remains extraordinarily strong, growth should be fine, but share is likely to be challenging in certain categories. Which brings me to how we are preparing. From a consumption perspective, we are preparing for all the economic letters, the V, the U, the W, et cetera, but with an eye to the long term. Investing to win on a sustainable basis. So to that end, we have now realigned our U.S. business unit structure, designed around the new platform based strategy, which we will unveil in September. We are implementing a new operating model to ensure we operate with a growth mindset, a high level of accountability and streamlined roles, responsibilities and decision rights for each role. We are capturing savings from continuous improvements, leveraging the upside we have seen to-date to invest even more than anticipated to renovate and differentiate our brands. And we are working hard to understand who is new to our brands and the best way to meaningfully connect with them. So regarding our path forward, while the depth and duration of this downturn will guide consumption in the near term, we are transforming our business for a better growth trajectory in the medium to long term. And consumers' embracement of our brands are providing us a significant opportunity right now. For instance, household penetration is one of the inherent strengths of our portfolio relative to the industry. And you would think that there was not much more room to go, but our household penetration has strengthened further in the later 15 weeks. In fact, 75% of our brands are growing household penetration, and the majority of our brands growing household penetration are up double-digit percentages points versus the same period last year. Across our iconic brands, we are experiencing growing household penetration and increasing the rate of repeat among new buyers. This includes big brands that were already well-established and significant leaders in their categories, such as Heinz in ketchup, Kraft Mac & Cheese, Ore-Ida, Planters, Philadelphia and Capri Sun. In terms of repeat rates, new buyers are repeating at higher rates than in the past and buying more frequently. In fact, 75% of new buyers since the pandemic started are still buying our products now. And finally, regarding new buyer demographics, smaller households, including those with no kids, are finding our brands. And our new buyer household skewed to higher income, younger and more diverse parts of the population, areas we have historically under indexed. All this means we have a tremendous opportunity to build our base of loyal consumers, and we're going after this aggressively with a second half plan that includes a 40% increase in working media dollars versus a year ago. To close, I just want to say how very proud I am of our colleagues for how they have responded to the challenges of the moment across our value chain and are showing tremendous agility in redeploying marketing investments to connect with the millions who are now making our brands part of their everyday lives. With that, I will turn it over to Paulo to talk through our financial results and outlook for the second half. Thank So in terms of overall, the company think about this commodity that is happening, we had some price. And you saw this in the beginning of the year; we had some price initiatives that we had to prepare for the year. And we, of course, our price strategy to commerce to follow the market. We also, as we said before, and as we mentioned in the call, we expect to have a more normal merchandising in the second half, that's what we saw in Q2. But we'll be operating in line with what is going to be the market for this commerce that we're seeing. John, thanks for the question. Let me \u2013 I guess, part of where I will start with is \u2013 let's put COVID aside for a second and I think getting to where your point is, which is what we see in the current economic pressures. Ultimately, that's going to be consumers, how they're going to be purchasing will be a function of basically how the economy is going to drop and how much time it will take to recover. Now both of those things, at this point, it's really hard to know how that's going to sort out. When we look back to some of the -- in the past of our recessions, whether that was in the U.S. in 2001, 2008 and 2009, our portfolio organic growth remain essentially largely consistent with what we saw pre the recession performance with the exception of foodservice. In foodservice, we actually saw a decline across both recessions because of the lower foot traffic in restaurants. So that takes me, I think, to your question of where do we stand today? What I would say is, I think we're well positioned. I think we have good momentum in the household penetration, as I mentioned. We are in better positioned on the promotional front end as we go into the second half of the year where we can invest back into our brands. And the investment is not just on the promotional event. As I mentioned earlier, we are also investing back in media. So we are seeing a 40% grade investment in the second half as we go into closing the year. So I think that from what we have learned and where we are today, I feel good about where we are. Let me \u2013 I guess, a comment on the innovation piece, and you're right. You're going to hear quite a bit more about our plans in September. So look forward to seeing you then. But I would tell you is that, I think, when we think about 2020, really, the impact has been kind of limited in terms of what we have seen and changing our plans of innovation. We \u2013 if you recall, we are actually, in 2020, have half the projects that we had a year ago. So we actually didn't see as much of an impact because of the changes. As we go to 2021, we'll be going to a little detail in September, but I can tell you that we're going to be focused on fewer, bigger innovation. And the good news is that, our R&D facilities actually have been open for about six, seven weeks. So actually, we feel very good about our pipeline as we go into next year. And I'm looking forward to kind of share with you the details of how that's going to come to live in September. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Kraft Heinz Company's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn the call over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Jakubik, you may begin.\nChris Jakubik: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our business update. We will begin today's call with an overview of our first quarter 2020 results, as well as an update on our path forward from Miguel Patricio, our CEO; Paulo Basilio, our CFO; and Carlos Abrams-Rivera, the Head of our U.S. business, and then we'll open the lines for your questions. Please note that during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. Now let's turn to Slide 3, and I'll hand it over to Miguel.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin my comments today with a few thoughts about purpose. To be leading one of the largest food companies in the world at the moment of an unprecedented crisis, at the same time, a privilege and a big responsibility, not only a big responsibility to our consumers and customers, but the big responsibility with our employees, our employees on the front lines, producing, distributing and shelving our products. Our teams understand exactly and have embraced our sense of duty. They are proud to be feeding the world. And suddenly, our purpose has become much more obvious: to keep feeding the world. At the start of the year, if you recall, our main objective for 2020 was to lay the foundation for the future growth, the first step in a 3-stage turnaround. I can tell you today, it's turning out to be just that and so much more. In February, I said the essential ingredients for our turnaround were in place. People with deep experience in key roles to drive functional excellence, perspective on where consumers are going and how we can win, productivity initiatives with detailed jobs to be done and the financial profile with strong free cash flow going forward. I think we are seeing each one of this on every front in what we cover today from our COVID-19 response, where our people are rising to the challenge, to Q1 results that show the underlying business in line with initial expectations and how we have met an unexpected spike in demand and increased consumption of our brands; our turnaround progress for 2020, which is on track, even as we adapt to this unprecedented call to action, making us cautiously optimistic for the rest of the year; and the fact that we are turning our strategic plans into action despite on strains of working virtually. As many of you have wrote, the next several months will be critical in understanding the path forward and potential for our industry. The same goes for Kraft Heinz at the pace of our turnaround in the near-term. We are in a highly dynamic, unprecedented environment, and what we think today may be significantly different from tomorrow. For now, let's focus on what this new world has meant for our business so far. In a nutshell, our response to this pandemic so far and how our people are rising to the challenge is showing ourselves and the rest of the world just how strong our company really are. In procurement, the team has worked over time to make sure we had adequate supplies to meet demand. They were building scenarios very early when things first started happening in China, increasing inventories of critical materials and finding new success. There's no question that we are meeting peak demand today because we did a great job anticipating the future. As I'm sure you can imagine, the situation continues to evolve rapidly, but I feel certain that I have the right team in place to prepare our business for what's ahead. In late February, we established our global Kraft Heinz coronavirus task force to actively monitor the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and in U.S. This has allowed us to take proactive steps to keep our employee and supply chain safe during this time. And we are learning through the journey, leveraging our global presence and sharing best practices across the organization at an unbelievable speed. But our people on the front lines in manufacturing, distribution and in-store sales are the real heroes in all this. And they are taking our business to the next level. Morale in our plants has never been so high, and I cannot say enough about our people's commitment. Our teams are producing with pride and purpose, working smart by eliminating those products with significant changeover times in order to boost production. In sales, not only has the team deployed itself more broadly to assist distribution and stock in retail shelves, but they have done an excellent job optimizing channel and SKU mix to make sure we get the right products where they are needed the most. And this has gone a long way in improving our collaboration and continuity with our retail partners, something we can build further upon once we have past this crisis. Our IT shared service, human resources, communication and legal teams have been anticipating our needs, enabling us to work closer even though we are physically further apart. They have been coordinating with our external partners, including government and community leaders so we can continue to be effective under various shelter-in-place rules state by state and country by country. And our finance team has been working tirelessly to improve both our liquidity and our forecast accuracy to enable industry-leading execution under multiple scenarios. Overall, our business is strong. We are operating to peak capacity, performing at world-class levels and leveraging our industry-leading safety, quality and hygiene practices. Our entire organization is displaying agility as demand forecasts and news flow can change scenarios multiple times per day. Going forward, as we will talk about later, this crisis is causing us to accelerate our supply chain, the complexity efforts, reprioritizing our merchandising calendars and rebalance our marketing efforts. I think this is an important moment where our culture of accountability, the speed and agility our lean structure can bring and our scale to be everywhere for consumers in times of uncertainty can be a real differentiator for Kraft Heinz. A big part of our strategy development was to get our marketers thinking about the future, building the future, to ask themselves what will happen next, what behaviors will change. Now we have to think about future consumption if 40% of adults live alone and will eat more meals at home, if kids eat more breakfast and lunches at home versus school or on the run, if new consumers that have come online stay online to their shopping; if consumers will continue consuming big trusted brands, brands that bring them comfort and familiarity in moments of uncertainty; and if drive-through and delivery becomes the norm, how we can be more creative with our foodservice customers and make our products more relevant. Turning to financial impacts. We've done our best to quantify the impact from the recent spike in demand, although we acknowledge, this does not come with our typical level of precision. On a net basis, we estimate that the additional demand that we have experienced as a result of COVID-19 resulted in about 6 to 7 points of incremental organic growth in the first quarter and with the contribution of 9 to 10 points of additional EBITDA growth. Looking forward, while Kraft Heinz, our customers and our peers will continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty, there are 4 expectations we have a high degree of confidence in sharing. First and foremost, we think it will be critical for our brands to reassert their advantages in taste, performance, value and reliability. So we will continue to step up investments behind our brands, and the work that's been done behind our new strategic plan has given us a head start on this front. Second, we expect our foodservice sales to decline between 30% and 70% in each of our geographic zones depending on channel mix as well as the creativity and agility both we and our customers display during this period. And keep in mind that foodservice represents roughly 15% of our net sales in each of our business segments.  Third, and perhaps the most important, the scenario planning we do regarding both at-home consumption trends and the likelihood for global recession will be key to our near-term growth and profitability, as well as building more strategic, collaborative and long-term relationships with our customers. And finally, I will tell you that we do not believe Q2 consumption patterns will be a reliable first indicator of what the new normal. Variables like at home versus away from home and recession versus growth will likely become clearer as the second half of the year unfolds. And obviously, all of this will play out differently by country in each one of the segments. So at this point, I will hand it off so Carlos and Paulo can discuss our business and financial results and outlook. And then I will return with few words on our Investor Day before we go to Q&A. With that, I'm delighted to introduce you to Carlos Abrams-Rivera, the new leader of our United States business. Well, to say that Carlos has hit the ground running would definitely be an understatement. Carlos?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks for the kind words, Miguel. The last 90 days have been challenging and even more rewarding than anticipated. I was familiar with most of the business and understood the opportunity for change. Our response to this crisis has only strengthened my believe that Kraft Heinz is in a unique position to serve families with trusted brands, has a strong sense of ownership and clarity of purpose to feed the world and demonstrating agility to rise to the challenge of the moment. As you would expect, I spent my first month getting to know the team, assessing our capabilities, doing some deep dive on underperforming business and shaping a new consumer-centric direction for our U.S. zone. And with the turnaround work already under way, I have worked quickly to add my own perspective into our efforts to simplify processes, distort marketing resources to higher ROI and gross margin part of the business, drive the complexity and establish clear priorities to deliver our commitment. All these efforts only intensified as a result of the crisis in which we are living. So I was expecting my first interaction with you will be to talk about the new integrated business plans we're installing to improve our forecasting, reduce waste and sharpen our strategic direction as well as the beginning of our sales transformation and steps we are taking to accelerate marketing excellence. For these last two months have had an extra layer of crisis management that, in many ways, is accelerating our turnaround, we are cautious to move faster to simplify manufacturing to maximize throughput, reevaluate our merchandising strategies, shift their marketing spending and adjust their messaging and strengthen our collaboration with our suppliers and customers. I will finish my initial observations by saying what a privilege it is to work with the thousands of colleagues who, day and night, are doing what's needed to make our trusted brands available all across our country. I have been amazed by the work of our teams, and nothing captured this better than the message that was born from our factories: We Got You, America. We were also inspired that we amplify their voices by bringing the spirit to live on film for all America to see on our hashtag We Got You, America as campaign. Now in terms of our Q1 results for the U.S. segment, we initially expect the Q1 sales to be pressured from a combination of pricing to offset dairy and meat inflation with related share loss and volume declines as we led on pricing; some carryover distribution losses, particularly in our frozen business; with a partial offset from strong foodservice growth as we lapped the prior year comparison due to winter storms last year. In January and February, the overall business performed slightly better than anticipated. However, our market share trends remain weak with natural cheese, cold cuts and frozen meals, in particular, is down roughly 2 points. In March, however, this trend reversed. Consumptions in cheese, meat, and most every category for them had accelerated, while foodservice sales fell more than 20% versus last year. As a result, Q1 organic growth was 6.4%. And in terms of profitability, we initially expected a mid-single-digit decline in adjusted EBITDA for Q1. Instead, we grew roughly 6%.  Looking forward right now, we think organic top line growth in Q2 will be in the mid-single-digit range. And this is based on our expectations for strong retail takeaway to continue, boosted by retail customers rebuilding inventory and with the foodservice sales declined by roughly 2/3. I would, however, caution you in expecting a similar top line growth in the second half of the year. This is because at some point soon, it is reasonable to expect initial pantry loading to run-off as consumers adjust to a new normal. Foodservice weakness is likely to continue beyond this initial crisis period. And keep in mind, we will exit the McCaf\u00e9 business in the U.S. beginning in Q3, and we'll now lap some distribution losses until late in the year. Now I will turn things over to Paul to talk through the results for the rest of the business and where we expect to go from here on the financial front.\nPaulo Basilio: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our new international segment. We came into the year expecting Q1 organic sales to sales to reflect growth in Asia and Latin America offset by product discontinuation in Australia and New Zealand. In net EBITDA we expected a decline after the prior year, driven by carryover supply chain inflation, mainly in Australia and New Zealand. Instead Q1 organic net sales grew nearly 7%, and constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 7.3%. This was driven by COVID-19 related sales, primarily in developed countries where disposable incomes allowed for greater stock up, specifically Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, although foodservice sales during the quarter were down more than 6%, with declines in both developed and emerging markets. Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic that our international business can see Q2 organic top line growth in the mid to high single-digit range, similar to that of Q1. Thus far, during this crisis period, we have seen our brands gain market share in most categories in most countries, and we expect solid retail sales momentum to continue. However, foodservice sales are at risk in the near term and we expect Q2 foodservice sales could decline 30% to 50% versus prior year. Turning to Canada. We initially expected Q1 organic sales to be down significantly from a combination of lower pricing due to both a higher level of trade activity as well as the timing of trade expenses versus the first quarter last year and lower volume, driven by lower coffee shipments, including our exit from McCaf\u00e9 at the start of the year. And we expected constant currency adjusted EBITDA to decline significantly versus the prior year, including the impact of the divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA was also expected to decline from a combination of the lower organic sales and supply chain inflation. In the end, top line growth came in better due to COVID-19-related consumption in March, and market share improved in the vast majority of our categories. However, declining profitability was disappointing, due to a combination of additional supply chain costs and the timing of trade expenses. As I said in February, more work needs to be done to turn underlying terms in Canada around, and we expect this to happen as the year progresses. For Q2, while we expect further benefit from greater at-home consumption, organic net sales are still likely to decline low single-digits as foodservices are expected to decline significantly versus the prior year, and we have the ongoing impact of the McCaf\u00e9 exit. At the same time, while adjusted EBITDA should decline due to divestiture impact and McCaf\u00e9 exit, EBITDA margin should begin to return to prior year levels in Q2 as both pricing and supply chain performance improved sequentially. Turning to total company performance. I do not want to repeat what we've discussed already, only to highlight three key points. First, while Q1 organic net sales growth was consistent with the approximately 6% growth we forecast at the beginning of the month, adjusted EBITDA came in somewhat better than expected at roughly flat on a constant currency basis, although it's still not reflecting the full benefit of the incremental sales in the quarter. The second thing to highlight relates to adjusted EPS, where the items below EBITDA, although unfavorable year-on-year, were largely consistent with our full year expectations. Finally, I would like to mention the improvement in our cash flow and cash generation. As many of you know, our first fiscal quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. That said, free cash flow in Q1 was nearly 1.5 times the prior year. And it's worth noting that at the end of Q1, we had a significant increase in quarter-end receivables due to the spike in demand. That was only partly offset by lower inventory levels. So we should see the free cash flow benefit from higher sales show up later this year, which brings me to our financial outlook. Like most companies today, it seems we have more scenarios than certainties as we look at the remainder of the year. At the same time, there are a number of things we can forecast and therefore, set a base that we can update as the year progresses. For instance, we still believe 2020 will be an important year of progress in the multiyear turnaround we envision. Recall that we set three priorities for 2020: we establish a strong base of sales and earnings, to rebuild underlying business momentum and continue to reduce debt while maintaining our current dividend. All these priorities are on-track even as we adapt to the new challenges. In addition, the negative year-over-year impact from the divestitures, business exits and the normalization of certain costs and business trends that we outlined in February held back our first quarter results, largely as expected. And we continue to think these same factors will continue to hold back our results for the remaining of the year. We do expect the Q1 impact from greater COVID-19 related demand, both sales and EBITDA that Miguel outlined earlier, will be additive to the full year 2020 financial expectations we laid out in February. And below EBITDA for the full year, we continue to expect a roughly $0.38 headwind, but reflecting an effective tax rate above our original 20% to 22% range due to a current U.K. tax view under consideration, a slightly higher interest expense due to our revolver drawdown, to be offset by more favorable other income versus our prior expectation. I will also note that if the change in U.K. tax law does occur in Q2, we are likely to see an effective tax rate of about 30% in the quarter due to a one-off non-cash adjustment to deferred tax liabilities, which brings me to our Q2 outlook. For Q2, all things considered, including recent data, we currently see low to mid-single-digit organic net sales growth and mid-single-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth as reasonable expectations. And while a stronger Q2 should mean greater upside for the full year, at this point, it remains a highly unpredictable environment. And it's, therefore, difficult to become significantly more optimistic about the second half. On one hand, there will be no pause in our initiatives to focus our investment in strengthened brand support behind our flagship brands and capital efficiencies. And we will continue to refine our merchandising calendars against available capacity to execute. On the other hand, we see 3 discrete factors that will hold back second half EBITDA. First is the McCaf\u00e9 exit that is already underway in Canada, but begins in the United States in July. Second is the incentive compensation also mentioned on our prior call. And third is currency translation, particularly given recent dollar strength. Together, these factors currently represent an approximately 700 basis point headwind to our second half results versus the prior year. In addition to that, we see a number of risks that are currently difficult to quantify, including foodservice sales and their certain pace of recovery, the potential for consumer pantry deloading and supply disruptions, as well as the possibility that the recent key commodity deflation we are seeing in the market could turn into greater commodity volatility and therefore, not benefit profitability as the year progresses. As a result, while we are comfortable calling for the Q1 upside and a good portion of potential Q2 outperformance to stick for the remaining of the year, we feel that there are too many unknowns at this time to confidently expect significant upside beyond that. At the same time, none of these uncertainties are expected to get in the way of our continued work and continued expectation to strengthen our balance sheet and adhere to the capital allocation priorities we laid out earlier this year. This includes maintaining our typical conservative posture as it relates to liquidity, which we believe is even more important as we focus on making sure all our products remain available to public during these challenging times. It also reflects our expectation that free cash generation as a percentage of net income is still expected to go up versus last year. And even though we are holding to our CapEx of $750 million for the year, we now expect to generate more cash than originally expected in excess of our normal dividend payout in 2020. So we are in a strong position to continue reducing our debt and look for opportunities to further improve our liquidity while we maintain our current dividend. With that, I will turn it back to Miguel for a preview of our Investor Day.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Paulo. As you know, we have been developing our new strategy, transforming our capabilities and making needed investments in the business for months. And no one was more anxious to share our work than we were. But uncertainties that have entered with COVID-19 have given rise to a heightened attention on the next five months versus the next five years. And frankly, it has made it more than appropriate for us and the broader industry to revisit assumptions, some strategic priorities and for us to revise the pacing of our savings and investment expectations. So we decided to move this event to September to do things once and do them in a holistic way. In September, we want our new leadership team to share our perspective on the unique assets and advantages we are building from, key findings and the paradigm shift we are employing and the new operating model we are putting into place and of course, give you a chance to ask questions to our broader team. We will walk through the extensive review we've done by category, by country and in market to build consumer understanding that has led to the new insights, how we think our portfolio fits today's consumer and how we can adapt and drive future consumer trends. We'll also provide our assessment of the unique building blocks we think we have at Kraft Heinz, assets such as scale, global footprint, deep household penetration, an unparalleled portfolio of business and brands, capabilities in the form of an advantaged cost structure and a culture of agility and accountability and how this can allow us to anticipate and deliver against consumer needs with agility at scale. We will also discuss how we no longer think about our portfolio as 55 product categories and individual businesses by geography. We are reorienting to how consumers think, a few specific platforms that are globally relevant, platforms that will leverage our strengths to drive property consumer insights and allow us to better prioritize our emerging market growth initiatives, for instance. It's an approach that we are very excited about, but more of this to come in September. And finally, we will provide with our blueprint for our future. We'll describe a new Kraft Heinz operating model that will include and address that many questions you have around; our new strategic priorities, marketing and sales initiatives and saving opportunities in sourcing and supply chain. We have a more clear view of the things that will make a difference for us, the things that will bring both more operating efficiency and better consumer relevance for our brands. We'll have a lot to discuss in September. For now, I will leave you with this. Standing here today with a comprehensive strategic plan, I'm even more confident that we can return Kraft Heinz to consistent, predictable top tier growth on both top line and bottom line.  Now we would be happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nPaulo Basilio: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: It's interesting. A number of food companies that have reported thus far have pulled full year guidance, certainly given all of the uncertainties, but have also been less comfortable providing any real outlook for \u2013 even for calendar 2Q. So it's interesting. What are you seeing, I guess, that's enabled Kraft Heinz to provide, as you call it, a reasonable expectation for 2Q perhaps when others have been less comfortable doing so?\nPaulo Basilio: Andrew, this is Paulo. We've been improving our way of communicating with the market and trying to share with investors and now how we're seeing the business. And again, we decided to give a better view, giving out the volatility that we're seeing in the market. We decided to share what we are seeing, although highlighting the risks, how we're seeing the Q2. And given the demand that we see in terms of our retail business, also the headwinds that we are facing our foodservices business. So it's the decision that we took to share with the market, how we're seeing this next \u2013 the Q2 and the next 2 months that we're at the end of April. And we are very cautious in relation of the second half. But it's because we believe that we have a good visibility and just an ability to share more our views for the quarter with the market.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. And I think you expect the profit flow-through from some of the incremental COVID-related demand in 2Q to be even stronger than the profit flow-through from that, that we saw in 1Q. So I'm just curious maybe what are some of the -- either some headwinds that potentially dissipate between 1Q and 2Q that will allow for this? Thanks so much.\nPaulo Basilio: Yes. No, I think very much the 3 drivers that are improving our profitability of sales fall-through to EBITDA are first, we are seeing a much better mix -- product mix versus what we have in Q1, including the retail versus foodservice. I think the second component is, where our supply chain performance, as we discussed before, we were seeing some supply chain headwinds come in Q1, and now they are behind us. And the third is a better balance between price and commodity costs. As we also highlighted in the prior call, we were lapping a very low price for one of the commodities in the Q1 that now we believe is going to be more balanced. This balance between price and commodities will be better. So those will be pretty much the three drivers that are driving the flow-through improvement from Q1 to Q2.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nMiguel Patricio: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nKen Goldman: Good morning. I wanted to ask about the input cost outlook. You did talk about how one of the risks is that current commodity deflation could become, I think, the word you used was a little more volatile. I was wondering if there's any potential for you to minimize some of that volatility, whether it's using futures contracts or hedges, just to take advantage a little bit of maybe some of the cheaper costs for some of the key items that you're buying today?\nPaulo Basilio: So, Ken, let me start here, and then maybe Carlos or Miguel can also comment, specifically Carlos. But we are seeing \u2013 there is no doubt that we are seeing a much more favorable environment in commodities than the start of the year. And also, we should \u2013 you should see sequential improvement from what we saw in Q1 versus Q2. For now, what I can tell you that is the favorability that we see in Q2, it's already considered in the outlook that we've just provided. But for the second half, for us now, it's too early to give any type of level of precisions given that level of volatility that we're still see in the market. And also, if you remember, there are also the component of uncertainty around the retail prices that will come.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Probably, the only thing I would add is that, as you said, the meat and dairy projections are within the outlook we've given for Q2.\nKen Goldman: Well, that makes sense. I'm just wondering if you're physically able to buy ahead a little further out. I know some of those futures contracts for months that are further out are not as liquid. But I'm just trying to figure out if there's a way for you to physically lock in some of the advantages that you might have. I'm not asking for guidance for the back half as much as I am for \u2013 just curious if there's any steps you can actually take right now to help yourself.\nMiguel Patricio: Listen, we have, in some cases, it varies. We have some opportunities to doing some type of markets depending of the commodity to do some hedges, and we are evaluating this. The future also as the spot price, they have differences. And there are some opportunities in terms of the inventory that we're exploring, but they are limited.\nKen Goldman: Okay. And very quickly as a follow-up. You are maintaining your CapEx guidance. Most food companies have lowered their CapEx guidance. Can you just talk about whether you consider at all deferring some capital projects into 2021? And whether that was a strong consideration, or what made you decide to keep the CapEx as it is?\nPaulo Basilio: Listen, we are \u2013 as Miguel and Carlos mentioned, we are \u2013 we have our clear strategic view. We have some relevant projects that we have. Our \u2013 as we are discussing our cash flow position, and our visibility of the business is strong in terms of cash. We are \u2013 of course, we are reevaluating and replanning the type of CapEx and the type of equipment that we will do and the timing that we're going to get them through the year. But we want to keep the investment and want to keep the execution that we plan for the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. I think I'm going to pivot to private label. In the past, Kraft has had trouble maintaining market share versus private label during times of commodity volatility. And your shares are up right now. What do you think retailers are going to do about their private label merchandising in the back half of the year, especially given the likelihood of a recession? Do you have any concerns that categories like cheese or meats might see more pressure than you're seeing right now from private label?\nMiguel Patricio: Look, Robert, I think in terms of uncertainty, consumers turn to brands that they trust. They want to experiment less. They want to experiment less with new brands. And that's what we're seeing right now. Our brands represent comfort for people. And I think that the consumers are coming back to big brands. As a result, our leading iconic brands are growing household penetration in almost every market, especially the developed markets like U.S., like Canada, like U.K. So I think it's critical that we continue investing behind our brands to reassert the advantage that we have in taste, in performance and in value. And I think also that for our customers, reliability and availability are extremely important in this environment. And this is where agility can, with scale, can really set you apart. I think that we are working with our customers in a very, very, very agile and close way. And I don't \u2013 and this is what's happening right now. Yes.\nRobert Moskow: Yes. I totally agree. But are you monitoring your price gaps? Maybe the price gaps don't matter that much today, but have they expanded since you initiated price increases in the start of the year, or is it just too volatile to know?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Listen, I think if you think about the fact that when we went through this process of the crisis, we actually were able to think about working with our customers what is the best way for us to actually reduce some of the promotional events that was happening right now in the marketplace. So both because of the fact that our inventories were a challenge and then we work with our customer to make sure we actually got to the right events that we wanted to have in the marketplace in places that we, in fact, had better inventory. As we're going back and going forward, we'll see that potentially our -- we'll be able to actually go back and start thinking about what are the promotional events that we can then pull back in the market to work in the right pricing, but that's only once we have the inventories back in place that we wanted in the year to go.\nRobert Moskow: Congrats on a great execution. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Excuse me, hi good morning everyone. I guess, maybe to follow-up a little bit on Rob's question. You went into this year with plans to increase marketing, also some product renovation and product innovation. So maybe could you talk about just how this situation has altered your plans? Are you still expecting to bring some innovation to market this year? And maybe also just how retailers are thinking about new products and product pipeline?\nMiguel Patricio: Sure. Bryan, Miguel. We disclosed in previous calls that it was in our plan, in our budget, to increase media around 30% this year, although this increase would be from \u2013 paid from within. So marketing shouldn't have a substantial growth, but media would grow 30%. It's our intention to keep the investments on our brands. And even evaluating right now, if we shouldn't even put more to create the momentum, and especially to keep the penetration that we are seeing, the increase in penetration of our brands with our consumers. Regarding innovation, we postponed a lot of innovation. Talking with our customers, we thought \u2013 actually, that was the best thing to do because at this moment, what we are doing is actually reducing the number of SKUs that we are producing, so we can have better productivity in our lines. And we both thought it was not the best moment of introducing innovation, so they were postponed.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me just add a couple of things, Miguel. One in terms of the marketing and what we're seeing is, listen, I think that Miguel said, we're committed to, in fact, spend more or less. Now what you're going to be seeing is that we will actually rebalance our lower marketing spend so that it can better reflect the healthful gains we're making and the new consumers that now have coming to our franchise. So as we speak, we're actually looking at what is the right media, the right channels for us to reach those new consumers that now have come into our franchises. Already some of that work is underway. And I think let me just give you a couple of examples how that translated into the marketplace. We're actually making some adjustment on sync like the Oscar Mayer, Front Yard Cookout, a way for us to stimulate during the grilling season that kind of behavior with our brands. You're also seeing things like our Heinz Designer Support, a way actually for us to give back to our diners in a moment in which they really need us. And then just switching, just one additional comment on the innovation part of the question. What I'll tell you is that completely aligned with Miguel in terms of us, adjusting some of the innovation. And in general terms, I think that we will continue to evaluate innovation as we think through the lens of capacity. The one challenging all this on innovation, you have to do with our food service. We are seeing already some restaurants that actually are shifting from things like tabletop to more portion control. We're working to adapt. I think we have a very agile organization that allows us to make this shift. And we're working with our customers to make sure that we supply them in the way they need now going forward.\nBryan Spillane: All right. That's very helpful. And just as a clarification, in terms of marketing and advertising levels, the plan \u2013 planned increases that you had for your budget this year are still embedded in the expectations. So it's not like the marketing budget or advertising is going to be lower this year and has to go up again next year. At least as you know now, you're planning to spend what you're originally expected to spend.\nPaulo Basilio: That is correct.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is now open.\nSteve Strycula: Hi, good morning. Quick clarification to Bryan's question. For the innovation slate that was pushed out, Miguel, can you clarify whether that was to the back half or the back-to-school season of this year, or is that maybe even a little bit further into 2021?\nMiguel Patricio: No. We are talking about what we had in the pipeline for this year. Yes, for the midyear for back-to-school and towards the end of the year. So we're talking about the remaining of the year, not 2021.\nSteve Strycula: Okay. Great. And then a more fundamental question, I would say is, as we think about going into Investor Day, one thing that you emphasized was the importance of scale in global platforms. When you look across the portfolio, which platforms do you define as being the most scalable and relevant to food is a little bit of a local business? And then in the past, when Kraft and \u2013 was first put together with Heinz, the company was emphasizing the degree of number one brands that were in the portfolio. So my question is, how is scale may be underutilized in the past? And how can a new strategy may be better execute and leverage that scale relative to how it was the last few years? Thank you. \nMiguel Patricio: Look, I think that scale is a critical work for us and what makes us different. We \u2013 especially in North America, we have scale. How \u2013 scale has to come with agility because if you have scale and you were not agile, that goes against you. But if you have agility of scale, it can be a killing combination. And I think that for us is very important. I think that the business in the past was managed almost by category. And then when you do that, it's like slicing the company in pieces. I think what we have to do is exactly take advantage of the commonalities, the scale that we have. And when you find these commonalities, then a lot of things come with it, insights, synergies. And so yes, I think that for us, we are absolutely intrigued with the benefits of agility at scale at this moment. Talking specifically about what can be global. What is global, what can be global and will be global is our ability to win in products that adds taste and flavor to foods. And instead of talking about ketchup and mustard and mayonnaise you know if you think about what are the products that actually enhance taste to food and what are the insights and the synergies that are behind is pretty exciting for us. So that's the way we are looking at. So when we think about platforms, we are starting with consumers, understanding what are the consumer needs, what are the main reasons, what their consumer is looking for and putting these categories, these products, these brands together, looking at commonalities of consumer needs, occasions, which is pretty exciting. And this is -- in China, maybe the enhancer's tastes are different, but the need is the same than here in United States. And we can leverage a lot to our global scale by understanding these needs in depth. Talking about brands global, because you asked about that. I think I think that we have Heinz as definitely a big global brand that we see every day more potential. And then we have the local jewels, right? We have Masters in China. We have CAD in Brazil. We have ABC in Indonesia that are brands that are local and are designed to enhance taste of local food. Not going through a lot of details because we don't have time for that, Steve. That would be what I would tell you.\nSteve Strycula: Very helpful. Thank you and congrats on the quarter.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you. Can I ask about your ability to sustain higher levels of production on the grocery side of the business, while restaurant traffic is down? I know you closed two \u2013 I believe you closed two foodservice plants in the U.S. and one in the U.K., so presumably, that's not easy to flex into grocery. Have you grocery have respond-- produced the same double-digit volume growth while the restaurant traffic is weak. And then as a quick follow-up, how secure is your supply of meat, given what we're hearing from the meat processing plants at the moment with some of your competitors back [inaudible] is that potentially a risk for you if you can secure supply? Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Let me give you a color of \u2013 more a global color on supply, and then I will ask Carlos to comment things specifically to U.S. We have at the moment, all our factories open. It's true that some of our foodservice factories are with very low production because of the reduction of demand. But we have 80 factories in the world, and they are all \u2013 that are all working. To date, our supply chain has been stable, and the team is showing that \u2013 how strong we are. There's a huge sense of pride right now in our factories. Morale is very high. Safety is our number one priority. And of course, there are risks in supply chain, but I think we've done a very good job on keeping our people safe. We have been very fast to adapt within our factories and distribution. Example, social distancing in the factories, we were very, very early to adopt it: PPES, like using masks, gloves, face guards, temperature checks, health certification. In all our factories, we are communicating regularly, very regularly daily with our teams. We have a task force daily routine with operations to monitor and to respond everything very quickly. In procurement, the team has made sure that we have had adequate supplies of meat despite spike in demand. We were building scenarios very, very early. When things started happening in China, we start increasing inventories of critical materials and finding access to materials that we thought we could have problems. So far, we haven't had any problem with procurement. In manufacturing and distribution, our frontline people are really the heroes. We are working three shifts in many of our factories. We are keeping our plants running 24/7. And we are showing a lot of agility with a huge sense of duty and responsibility. We are taking actions to accelerate the decomplexity and improve the throughput. We are benefiting from process improvements and sharing and adapting best practices around the world. Maybe, Carlos, you want to give a perspective on U.S., specifically on the question?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Well, I think, Miguel, I think you covered the overall supply chain and how we're feeling about it. Just to go deeper then in terms of what's happening here in the U.S., I think in the news, you have all heard, there's been a certain amount of constraint happening right now within the meat processing. Well, as Miguel said, I'm pretty proud of the fact that as an organization, we took actions early, the point that Miguel made around safety being the number one priority, the elements that we put in our factories to protect our overall lead supply chain, social distancing, PPE, temperature checks, twice-a-day operation calls to make sure that we are sharing best practices and adapted quickly to a situation. Today, we're basically pulling all levers to make sure that we make meat available to our consumers as fast as we can. We believe that right now, the way we are seeing the outlook for Q2 is actually manageable with the information that we share with you. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nKevin Lehmann: It's actually Kevin Lehmann on for David. Good morning. It looks like the U.S. segment saw reduced promo spend in Q1, but then higher promo spend in Canada. Certainly, the company is experiencing more supply chain inflation lately to keep up, of course, with at-home demand. And then you just mentioned meat and dairy volatility. Can you help us organize perhaps the biggest buckets of higher and lower costs in 2020 that we should expect to continue that are directly related to COVID? Thanks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me just tell you, first, in terms of our overall promotion strategy in the U.S. and then I'll have Paulo ask some additional information. When we look at the world as I mentioned earlier, we saw that initially, the \u2013 because of the tightness of the inventories at the moment of the search that occur, we actually were able to work with our customers to reduce our promotional spending. We were very specific about where the places that we were actually going to reduce their promotional spend and then work with our customers to then say, as inventories improve and we go forward, we'll be able to then judiciously bring those promotions back into the pipeline in the year to go events that we were looking at. So that it continues to be a valuation. I think where we are in constant communication with our customer, which actually has only improved the way we are managing through this together to make sure we have the right availability of product at the right promotional events only as the customers that needed to be the particular situation that they're facing. Paulo, if you want to add something?\nPaulo Basilio: Yes. Sorry, I don't know if I understood correctly the first part of the question. I don't know if your question was about Canada. Do you want to -- can you clarify a little bit the second part of the question, please?\nKevin Lehmann: Yes, just helping us organize the elevated costs or the lower costs that we should expect in 2020 that are specifically related to the COVID crisis, whether it's \u2013 I mean, you touched on the promo changes, but also commodity volatility, supply chain that are specifically related to pantry loading and COVID-related items.\nPaulo Basilio: Okay. So I think trying to organize, we have like clearly, the \u2013 as a consequence, some benefit in commodities that I've already discussed. And again, the numbers are already discussed in our Q2 outlook. I think there is another component that is the component of the additional cost that we are having in the business to keep the business running as we go through this situation in terms of additional cost for ramp up, the capacity, the incentives that we need to give for our front-line workers, additional equipment that we need to have. I think overall, all of those costs, they are happening with us. They are growing, but I would say that they are manageable, okay? And we are managing them. And they are also included in this outlook of Q2 that we have. So I think the high level that I would \u2013 it's split would be like we have this commodity, a situation that we're seeing today. We have this additional cost. And on the other side, we have a better productivity from our lines, from our plants being brought by the higher volume that we have.\nKevin Lehmann: Very helpful. Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: You are welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Jakubik for any closing remarks.\nChris Jakubik: Thanks very much, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. For the analysts that have follow-up questions, myself and Andy Larkin will be available for you. And for anyone in the media, Michael Mullen will be available to take your calls. Thanks very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin my comments today with a few thoughts about purpose. To be leading one of the largest food companies in the world at the moment of an unprecedented crisis, at the same time, a privilege and a big responsibility, not only a big responsibility to our consumers and customers, but the big responsibility with our employees, our employees on the front lines, producing, distributing and shelving our products. Our teams understand exactly and have embraced our sense of duty. They are proud to be feeding the world. And suddenly, our purpose has become much more obvious: to keep feeding the world. At the start of the year, if you recall, our main objective for 2020 was to lay the foundation for the future growth, the first step in a 3-stage turnaround. I can tell you today, it's turning out to be just that and so much more. In February, I said the essential ingredients for our turnaround were in place. People with deep experience in key roles to drive functional excellence, perspective on where consumers are going and how we can win, productivity initiatives with detailed jobs to be done and the financial profile with strong free cash flow going forward. I think we are seeing each one of this on every front in what we cover today from our COVID-19 response, where our people are rising to the challenge, to Q1 results that show the underlying business in line with initial expectations and how we have met an unexpected spike in demand and increased consumption of our brands; our turnaround progress for 2020, which is on track, even as we adapt to this unprecedented call to action, making us cautiously optimistic for the rest of the year; and the fact that we are turning our strategic plans into action despite on strains of working virtually. As many of you have wrote, the next several months will be critical in understanding the path forward and potential for our industry. The same goes for Kraft Heinz at the pace of our turnaround in the near-term. We are in a highly dynamic, unprecedented environment, and what we think today may be significantly different from tomorrow. For now, let's focus on what this new world has meant for our business so far. In a nutshell, our response to this pandemic so far and how our people are rising to the challenge is showing ourselves and the rest of the world just how strong our company really are. In procurement, the team has worked over time to make sure we had adequate supplies to meet demand. They were building scenarios very early when things first started happening in China, increasing inventories of critical materials and finding new success. There's no question that we are meeting peak demand today because we did a great job anticipating the future. As I'm sure you can imagine, the situation continues to evolve rapidly, but I feel certain that I have the right team in place to prepare our business for what's ahead. In late February, we established our global Kraft Heinz coronavirus task force to actively monitor the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide and in U.S. This has allowed us to take proactive steps to keep our employee and supply chain safe during this time. And we are learning through the journey, leveraging our global presence and sharing best practices across the organization at an unbelievable speed. But our people on the front lines in manufacturing, distribution and in-store sales are the real heroes in all this. And they are taking our business to the next level. Morale in our plants has never been so high, and I cannot say enough about our people's commitment. Our teams are producing with pride and purpose, working smart by eliminating those products with significant changeover times in order to boost production. In sales, not only has the team deployed itself more broadly to assist distribution and stock in retail shelves, but they have done an excellent job optimizing channel and SKU mix to make sure we get the right products where they are needed the most. And this has gone a long way in improving our collaboration and continuity with our retail partners, something we can build further upon once we have past this crisis. Our IT shared service, human resources, communication and legal teams have been anticipating our needs, enabling us to work closer even though we are physically further apart. They have been coordinating with our external partners, including government and community leaders so we can continue to be effective under various shelter-in-place rules state by state and country by country. And our finance team has been working tirelessly to improve both our liquidity and our forecast accuracy to enable industry-leading execution under multiple scenarios. Overall, our business is strong. We are operating to peak capacity, performing at world-class levels and leveraging our industry-leading safety, quality and hygiene practices. Our entire organization is displaying agility as demand forecasts and news flow can change scenarios multiple times per day. Going forward, as we will talk about later, this crisis is causing us to accelerate our supply chain, the complexity efforts, reprioritizing our merchandising calendars and rebalance our marketing efforts. I think this is an important moment where our culture of accountability, the speed and agility our lean structure can bring and our scale to be everywhere for consumers in times of uncertainty can be a real differentiator for Kraft Heinz. A big part of our strategy development was to get our marketers thinking about the future, building the future, to ask themselves what will happen next, what behaviors will change. Now we have to think about future consumption if 40% of adults live alone and will eat more meals at home, if kids eat more breakfast and lunches at home versus school or on the run, if new consumers that have come online stay online to their shopping; if consumers will continue consuming big trusted brands, brands that bring them comfort and familiarity in moments of uncertainty; and if drive-through and delivery becomes the norm, how we can be more creative with our foodservice customers and make our products more relevant. Turning to financial impacts. We've done our best to quantify the impact from the recent spike in demand, although we acknowledge, this does not come with our typical level of precision. On a net basis, we estimate that the additional demand that we have experienced as a result of COVID-19 resulted in about 6 to 7 points of incremental organic growth in the first quarter and with the contribution of 9 to 10 points of additional EBITDA growth. Looking forward, while Kraft Heinz, our customers and our peers will continue to operate in an environment of significant uncertainty, there are 4 expectations we have a high degree of confidence in sharing. First and foremost, we think it will be critical for our brands to reassert their advantages in taste, performance, value and reliability. So we will continue to step up investments behind our brands, and the work that's been done behind our new strategic plan has given us a head start on this front. Second, we expect our foodservice sales to decline between 30% and 70% in each of our geographic zones depending on channel mix as well as the creativity and agility both we and our customers display during this period. And keep in mind that foodservice represents roughly 15% of our net sales in each of our business segments.  Third, and perhaps the most important, the scenario planning we do regarding both at-home consumption trends and the likelihood for global recession will be key to our near-term growth and profitability, as well as building more strategic, collaborative and long-term relationships with our customers. And finally, I will tell you that we do not believe Q2 consumption patterns will be a reliable first indicator of what the new normal. Variables like at home versus away from home and recession versus growth will likely become clearer as the second half of the year unfolds. And obviously, all of this will play out differently by country in each one of the segments. So at this point, I will hand it off so Carlos and Paulo can discuss our business and financial results and outlook. And then I will return with few words on our Investor Day before we go to Q&A. With that, I'm delighted to introduce you to Carlos Abrams-Rivera, the new leader of our United States business. Well, to say that Carlos has hit the ground running would definitely be an understatement. Carlos? Thank you, Paulo. As you know, we have been developing our new strategy, transforming our capabilities and making needed investments in the business for months. And no one was more anxious to share our work than we were. But uncertainties that have entered with COVID-19 have given rise to a heightened attention on the next five months versus the next five years. And frankly, it has made it more than appropriate for us and the broader industry to revisit assumptions, some strategic priorities and for us to revise the pacing of our savings and investment expectations. So we decided to move this event to September to do things once and do them in a holistic way. In September, we want our new leadership team to share our perspective on the unique assets and advantages we are building from, key findings and the paradigm shift we are employing and the new operating model we are putting into place and of course, give you a chance to ask questions to our broader team. We will walk through the extensive review we've done by category, by country and in market to build consumer understanding that has led to the new insights, how we think our portfolio fits today's consumer and how we can adapt and drive future consumer trends. We'll also provide our assessment of the unique building blocks we think we have at Kraft Heinz, assets such as scale, global footprint, deep household penetration, an unparalleled portfolio of business and brands, capabilities in the form of an advantaged cost structure and a culture of agility and accountability and how this can allow us to anticipate and deliver against consumer needs with agility at scale. We will also discuss how we no longer think about our portfolio as 55 product categories and individual businesses by geography. We are reorienting to how consumers think, a few specific platforms that are globally relevant, platforms that will leverage our strengths to drive property consumer insights and allow us to better prioritize our emerging market growth initiatives, for instance. It's an approach that we are very excited about, but more of this to come in September. And finally, we will provide with our blueprint for our future. We'll describe a new Kraft Heinz operating model that will include and address that many questions you have around; our new strategic priorities, marketing and sales initiatives and saving opportunities in sourcing and supply chain. We have a more clear view of the things that will make a difference for us, the things that will bring both more operating efficiency and better consumer relevance for our brands. We'll have a lot to discuss in September. For now, I will leave you with this. Standing here today with a comprehensive strategic plan, I'm even more confident that we can return Kraft Heinz to consistent, predictable top tier growth on both top line and bottom line.  Now we would be happy to take your questions. You are welcome. Good morning. Listen, we have, in some cases, it varies. We have some opportunities to doing some type of markets depending of the commodity to do some hedges, and we are evaluating this. The future also as the spot price, they have differences. And there are some opportunities in terms of the inventory that we're exploring, but they are limited. Look, Robert, I think in terms of uncertainty, consumers turn to brands that they trust. They want to experiment less. They want to experiment less with new brands. And that's what we're seeing right now. Our brands represent comfort for people. And I think that the consumers are coming back to big brands. As a result, our leading iconic brands are growing household penetration in almost every market, especially the developed markets like U.S., like Canada, like U.K. So I think it's critical that we continue investing behind our brands to reassert the advantage that we have in taste, in performance and in value. And I think also that for our customers, reliability and availability are extremely important in this environment. And this is where agility can, with scale, can really set you apart. I think that we are working with our customers in a very, very, very agile and close way. And I don't \u2013 and this is what's happening right now. Yes. Sure. Bryan, Miguel. We disclosed in previous calls that it was in our plan, in our budget, to increase media around 30% this year, although this increase would be from \u2013 paid from within. So marketing shouldn't have a substantial growth, but media would grow 30%. It's our intention to keep the investments on our brands. And even evaluating right now, if we shouldn't even put more to create the momentum, and especially to keep the penetration that we are seeing, the increase in penetration of our brands with our consumers. Regarding innovation, we postponed a lot of innovation. Talking with our customers, we thought \u2013 actually, that was the best thing to do because at this moment, what we are doing is actually reducing the number of SKUs that we are producing, so we can have better productivity in our lines. And we both thought it was not the best moment of introducing innovation, so they were postponed. No. We are talking about what we had in the pipeline for this year. Yes, for the midyear for back-to-school and towards the end of the year. So we're talking about the remaining of the year, not 2021. Look, I think that scale is a critical work for us and what makes us different. We \u2013 especially in North America, we have scale. How \u2013 scale has to come with agility because if you have scale and you were not agile, that goes against you. But if you have agility of scale, it can be a killing combination. And I think that for us is very important. I think that the business in the past was managed almost by category. And then when you do that, it's like slicing the company in pieces. I think what we have to do is exactly take advantage of the commonalities, the scale that we have. And when you find these commonalities, then a lot of things come with it, insights, synergies. And so yes, I think that for us, we are absolutely intrigued with the benefits of agility at scale at this moment. Talking specifically about what can be global. What is global, what can be global and will be global is our ability to win in products that adds taste and flavor to foods. And instead of talking about ketchup and mustard and mayonnaise you know if you think about what are the products that actually enhance taste to food and what are the insights and the synergies that are behind is pretty exciting for us. So that's the way we are looking at. So when we think about platforms, we are starting with consumers, understanding what are the consumer needs, what are the main reasons, what their consumer is looking for and putting these categories, these products, these brands together, looking at commonalities of consumer needs, occasions, which is pretty exciting. And this is -- in China, maybe the enhancer's tastes are different, but the need is the same than here in United States. And we can leverage a lot to our global scale by understanding these needs in depth. Talking about brands global, because you asked about that. I think I think that we have Heinz as definitely a big global brand that we see every day more potential. And then we have the local jewels, right? We have Masters in China. We have CAD in Brazil. We have ABC in Indonesia that are brands that are local and are designed to enhance taste of local food. Not going through a lot of details because we don't have time for that, Steve. That would be what I would tell you. Thank you. Good morning. Okay. Let me give you a color of \u2013 more a global color on supply, and then I will ask Carlos to comment things specifically to U.S. We have at the moment, all our factories open. It's true that some of our foodservice factories are with very low production because of the reduction of demand. But we have 80 factories in the world, and they are all \u2013 that are all working. To date, our supply chain has been stable, and the team is showing that \u2013 how strong we are. There's a huge sense of pride right now in our factories. Morale is very high. Safety is our number one priority. And of course, there are risks in supply chain, but I think we've done a very good job on keeping our people safe. We have been very fast to adapt within our factories and distribution. Example, social distancing in the factories, we were very, very early to adopt it: PPES, like using masks, gloves, face guards, temperature checks, health certification. In all our factories, we are communicating regularly, very regularly daily with our teams. We have a task force daily routine with operations to monitor and to respond everything very quickly. In procurement, the team has made sure that we have had adequate supplies of meat despite spike in demand. We were building scenarios very, very early. When things started happening in China, we start increasing inventories of critical materials and finding access to materials that we thought we could have problems. So far, we haven't had any problem with procurement. In manufacturing and distribution, our frontline people are really the heroes. We are working three shifts in many of our factories. We are keeping our plants running 24/7. And we are showing a lot of agility with a huge sense of duty and responsibility. We are taking actions to accelerate the decomplexity and improve the throughput. We are benefiting from process improvements and sharing and adapting best practices around the world. Maybe, Carlos, you want to give a perspective on U.S., specifically on the question?"

            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. I will start with our new international segment. We came into the year expecting Q1 organic sales to sales to reflect growth in Asia and Latin America offset by product discontinuation in Australia and New Zealand. In net EBITDA we expected a decline after the prior year, driven by carryover supply chain inflation, mainly in Australia and New Zealand. Instead Q1 organic net sales grew nearly 7%, and constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 7.3%. This was driven by COVID-19 related sales, primarily in developed countries where disposable incomes allowed for greater stock up, specifically Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand, although foodservice sales during the quarter were down more than 6%, with declines in both developed and emerging markets. Looking forward, we are cautiously optimistic that our international business can see Q2 organic top line growth in the mid to high single-digit range, similar to that of Q1. Thus far, during this crisis period, we have seen our brands gain market share in most categories in most countries, and we expect solid retail sales momentum to continue. However, foodservice sales are at risk in the near term and we expect Q2 foodservice sales could decline 30% to 50% versus prior year. Turning to Canada. We initially expected Q1 organic sales to be down significantly from a combination of lower pricing due to both a higher level of trade activity as well as the timing of trade expenses versus the first quarter last year and lower volume, driven by lower coffee shipments, including our exit from McCafe\u0301 at the start of the year. And we expected constant currency adjusted EBITDA to decline significantly versus the prior year, including the impact of the divestiture. Excluding the divestiture, adjusted EBITDA was also expected to decline from a combination of the lower organic sales and supply chain inflation. In the end, top line growth came in better due to COVID-19-related consumption in March, and market share improved in the vast majority of our categories. However, declining profitability was disappointing, due to a combination of additional supply chain costs and the timing of trade expenses. As I said in February, more work needs to be done to turn underlying terms in Canada around, and we expect this to happen as the year progresses. For Q2, while we expect further benefit from greater at-home consumption, organic net sales are still likely to decline low single-digits as foodservices are expected to decline significantly versus the prior year, and we have the ongoing impact of the McCafe\u0301 exit. At the same time, while adjusted EBITDA should decline due to divestiture impact and McCafe\u0301 exit, EBITDA margin should begin to return to prior year levels in Q2 as both pricing and supply chain performance improved sequentially. Turning to total company performance. I do not want to repeat what we've discussed already, only to highlight three key points. First, while Q1 organic net sales growth was consistent with the approximately 6% growth we forecast at the beginning of the month, adjusted EBITDA came in somewhat better than expected at roughly flat on a constant currency basis, although it's still not reflecting the full benefit of the incremental sales in the quarter. The second thing to highlight relates to adjusted EPS, where the items below EBITDA, although unfavorable year-on-year, were largely consistent with our full year expectations. Finally, I would like to mention the improvement in our cash flow and cash generation. As many of you know, our first fiscal quarter is typically our lowest in terms of cash generation. That said, free cash flow in Q1 was nearly 1.5 times the prior year. And it's worth noting that at the end of Q1, we had a significant increase in quarter-end receivables due to the spike in demand. That was only partly offset by lower inventory levels. So we should see the free cash flow benefit from higher sales show up later this year, which brings me to our financial outlook. Like most companies today, it seems we have more scenarios than certainties as we look at the remainder of the year. At the same time, there are a number of things we can forecast and therefore, set a base that we can update as the year progresses. For instance, we still believe 2020 will be an important year of progress in the multiyear turnaround we envision. Recall that we set three priorities for 2020: we establish a strong base of sales and earnings, to rebuild underlying business momentum and continue to reduce debt while maintaining our current dividend. All these priorities are on-track even as we adapt to the new challenges. In addition, the negative year-over-year impact from the divestitures, business exits and the normalization of certain costs and business trends that we outlined in February held back our first quarter results, largely as expected. And we continue to think these same factors will continue to hold back our results for the remaining of the year. We do expect the Q1 impact from greater COVID-19 related demand, both sales and EBITDA that Miguel outlined earlier, will be additive to the full year 2020 financial expectations we laid out in February. And below EBITDA for the full year, we continue to expect a roughly $0.38 headwind, but reflecting an effective tax rate above our original 20% to 22% range due to a current U.K. tax view under consideration, a slightly higher interest expense due to our revolver drawdown, to be offset by more favorable other income versus our prior expectation. I will also note that if the change in U.K. tax law does occur in Q2, we are likely to see an effective tax rate of about 30% in the quarter due to a one-off non-cash adjustment to deferred tax liabilities, which brings me to our Q2 outlook. For Q2, all things considered, including recent data, we currently see low to mid-single-digit organic net sales growth and mid-single-digit constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth as reasonable expectations. And while a stronger Q2 should mean greater upside for the full year, at this point, it remains a highly unpredictable environment. And it's, therefore, difficult to become significantly more optimistic about the second half. On one hand, there will be no pause in our initiatives to focus our investment in strengthened brand support behind our flagship brands and capital efficiencies. And we will continue to refine our merchandising calendars against available capacity to execute. On the other hand, we see 3 discrete factors that will hold back second half EBITDA. First is the McCafe\u0301 exit that is already underway in Canada, but begins in the United States in July. Second is the incentive compensation also mentioned on our prior call. And third is currency translation, particularly given recent dollar strength. Together, these factors currently represent an approximately 700 basis point headwind to our second half results versus the prior year. In addition to that, we see a number of risks that are currently difficult to quantify, including foodservice sales and their certain pace of recovery, the potential for consumer pantry deloading and supply disruptions, as well as the possibility that the recent key commodity deflation we are seeing in the market could turn into greater commodity volatility and therefore, not benefit profitability as the year progresses. As a result, while we are comfortable calling for the Q1 upside and a good portion of potential Q2 outperformance to stick for the remaining of the year, we feel that there are too many unknowns at this time to confidently expect significant upside beyond that. At the same time, none of these uncertainties are expected to get in the way of our continued work and continued expectation to strengthen our balance sheet and adhere to the capital allocation priorities we laid out earlier this year. This includes maintaining our typical conservative posture as it relates to liquidity, which we believe is even more important as we focus on making sure all our products remain available to public during these challenging times. It also reflects our expectation that free cash generation as a percentage of net income is still expected to go up versus last year. And even though we are holding to our CapEx of $750 million for the year, we now expect to generate more cash than originally expected in excess of our normal dividend payout in 2020. So we are in a strong position to continue reducing our debt and look for opportunities to further improve our liquidity while we maintain our current dividend. With that, I will turn it back to Miguel for a preview of our Investor Day. Good morning Andrew. Andrew, this is Paulo. We've been improving our way of communicating with the market and trying to share with investors and now how we're seeing the business. And again, we decided to give a better view, giving out the volatility that we're seeing in the market. We decided to share what we are seeing, although highlighting the risks, how we're seeing the Q2. And given the demand that we see in terms of our retail business, also the headwinds that we are facing our foodservices business. So it's the decision that we took to share with the market, how we're seeing this next \u2013 the Q2 and the next 2 months that we're at the end of April. And we are very cautious in relation of the second half. But it's because we believe that we have a good visibility and just an ability to share more our views for the quarter with the market. Yes. No, I think very much the 3 drivers that are improving our profitability of sales fall-through to EBITDA are first, we are seeing a much better mix -- product mix versus what we have in Q1, including the retail versus foodservice. I think the second component is, where our supply chain performance, as we discussed before, we were seeing some supply chain headwinds come in Q1, and now they are behind us. And the third is a better balance between price and commodity costs. As we also highlighted in the prior call, we were lapping a very low price for one of the commodities in the Q1 that now we believe is going to be more balanced. This balance between price and commodities will be better. So those will be pretty much the three drivers that are driving the flow-through improvement from Q1 to Q2. So, Ken, let me start here, and then maybe Carlos or Miguel can also comment, specifically Carlos. But we are seeing \u2013 there is no doubt that we are seeing a much more favorable environment in commodities than the start of the year. And also, we should \u2013 you should see sequential improvement from what we saw in Q1 versus Q2. For now, what I can tell you that is the favorability that we see in Q2, it's already considered in the outlook that we've just provided. But for the second half, for us now, it's too early to give any type of level of precisions given that level of volatility that we're still see in the market. And also, if you remember, there are also the component of uncertainty around the retail prices that will come. Listen, we are \u2013 as Miguel and Carlos mentioned, we are \u2013 we have our clear strategic view. We have some relevant projects that we have. Our \u2013 as we are discussing our cash flow position, and our visibility of the business is strong in terms of cash. We are \u2013 of course, we are reevaluating and replanning the type of CapEx and the type of equipment that we will do and the timing that we're going to get them through the year. But we want to keep the investment and want to keep the execution that we plan for the year. That is correct. Yes. Sorry, I don't know if I understood correctly the first part of the question. I don't know if your question was about Canada. Do you want to -- can you clarify a little bit the second part of the question, please? Okay. So I think trying to organize, we have like clearly, the \u2013 as a consequence, some benefit in commodities that I've already discussed. And again, the numbers are already discussed in our Q2 outlook. I think there is another component that is the component of the additional cost that we are having in the business to keep the business running as we go through this situation in terms of additional cost for ramp up, the capacity, the incentives that we need to give for our front-line workers, additional equipment that we need to have. I think overall, all of those costs, they are happening with us. They are growing, but I would say that they are manageable, okay? And we are managing them. And they are also included in this outlook of Q2 that we have. So I think the high level that I would \u2013 it's split would be like we have this commodity, a situation that we're seeing today. We have this additional cost. And on the other side, we have a better productivity from our lines, from our plants being brought by the higher volume that we have. You are welcome."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks for the kind words, Miguel. The last 90 days have been challenging and even more rewarding than anticipated. I was familiar with most of the business and understood the opportunity for change. Our response to this crisis has only strengthened my believe that Kraft Heinz is in a unique position to serve families with trusted brands, has a strong sense of ownership and clarity of purpose to feed the world and demonstrating agility to rise to the challenge of the moment. As you would expect, I spent my first month getting to know the team, assessing our capabilities, doing some deep dive on underperforming business and shaping a new consumer-centric direction for our U.S. zone. And with the turnaround work already under way, I have worked quickly to add my own perspective into our efforts to simplify processes, distort marketing resources to higher ROI and gross margin part of the business, drive the complexity and establish clear priorities to deliver our commitment. All these efforts only intensified as a result of the crisis in which we are living. So I was expecting my first interaction with you will be to talk about the new integrated business plans we're installing to improve our forecasting, reduce waste and sharpen our strategic direction as well as the beginning of our sales transformation and steps we are taking to accelerate marketing excellence. For these last two months have had an extra layer of crisis management that, in many ways, is accelerating our turnaround, we are cautious to move faster to simplify manufacturing to maximize throughput, reevaluate our merchandising strategies, shift their marketing spending and adjust their messaging and strengthen our collaboration with our suppliers and customers. I will finish my initial observations by saying what a privilege it is to work with the thousands of colleagues who, day and night, are doing what's needed to make our trusted brands available all across our country. I have been amazed by the work of our teams, and nothing captured this better than the message that was born from our factories: We Got You, America. We were also inspired that we amplify their voices by bringing the spirit to live on film for all America to see on our hashtag We Got You, America as campaign. Now in terms of our Q1 results for the U.S. segment, we initially expect the Q1 sales to be pressured from a combination of pricing to offset dairy and meat inflation with related share loss and volume declines as we led on pricing; some carryover distribution losses, particularly in our frozen business; with a partial offset from strong foodservice growth as we lapped the prior year comparison due to winter storms last year. In January and February, the overall business performed slightly better than anticipated. However, our market share trends remain weak with natural cheese, cold cuts and frozen meals, in particular, is down roughly 2 points. In March, however, this trend reversed. Consumptions in cheese, meat, and most every category for them had accelerated, while foodservice sales fell more than 20% versus last year. As a result, Q1 organic growth was 6.4%. And in terms of profitability, we initially expected a mid-single-digit decline in adjusted EBITDA for Q1. Instead, we grew roughly 6%.  Looking forward right now, we think organic top line growth in Q2 will be in the mid-single-digit range. And this is based on our expectations for strong retail takeaway to continue, boosted by retail customers rebuilding inventory and with the foodservice sales declined by roughly 2/3. I would, however, caution you in expecting a similar top line growth in the second half of the year. This is because at some point soon, it is reasonable to expect initial pantry loading to run-off as consumers adjust to a new normal. Foodservice weakness is likely to continue beyond this initial crisis period. And keep in mind, we will exit the McCafe\u0301 business in the U.S. beginning in Q3, and we'll now lap some distribution losses until late in the year. Now I will turn things over to Paul to talk through the results for the rest of the business and where we expect to go from here on the financial front. Probably, the only thing I would add is that, as you said, the meat and dairy projections are within the outlook we've given for Q2. Listen, I think if you think about the fact that when we went through this process of the crisis, we actually were able to think about working with our customers what is the best way for us to actually reduce some of the promotional events that was happening right now in the marketplace. So both because of the fact that our inventories were a challenge and then we work with our customer to make sure we actually got to the right events that we wanted to have in the marketplace in places that we, in fact, had better inventory. As we're going back and going forward, we'll see that potentially our -- we'll be able to actually go back and start thinking about what are the promotional events that we can then pull back in the market to work in the right pricing, but that's only once we have the inventories back in place that we wanted in the year to go. Let me just add a couple of things, Miguel. One in terms of the marketing and what we're seeing is, listen, I think that Miguel said, we're committed to, in fact, spend more or less. Now what you're going to be seeing is that we will actually rebalance our lower marketing spend so that it can better reflect the healthful gains we're making and the new consumers that now have coming to our franchise. So as we speak, we're actually looking at what is the right media, the right channels for us to reach those new consumers that now have come into our franchises. Already some of that work is underway. And I think let me just give you a couple of examples how that translated into the marketplace. We're actually making some adjustment on sync like the Oscar Mayer, Front Yard Cookout, a way for us to stimulate during the grilling season that kind of behavior with our brands. You're also seeing things like our Heinz Designer Support, a way actually for us to give back to our diners in a moment in which they really need us. And then just switching, just one additional comment on the innovation part of the question. What I'll tell you is that completely aligned with Miguel in terms of us, adjusting some of the innovation. And in general terms, I think that we will continue to evaluate innovation as we think through the lens of capacity. The one challenging all this on innovation, you have to do with our food service. We are seeing already some restaurants that actually are shifting from things like tabletop to more portion control. We're working to adapt. I think we have a very agile organization that allows us to make this shift. And we're working with our customers to make sure that we supply them in the way they need now going forward. Yes. Well, I think, Miguel, I think you covered the overall supply chain and how we're feeling about it. Just to go deeper then in terms of what's happening here in the U.S., I think in the news, you have all heard, there's been a certain amount of constraint happening right now within the meat processing. Well, as Miguel said, I'm pretty proud of the fact that as an organization, we took actions early, the point that Miguel made around safety being the number one priority, the elements that we put in our factories to protect our overall lead supply chain, social distancing, PPE, temperature checks, twice-a-day operation calls to make sure that we are sharing best practices and adapted quickly to a situation. Today, we're basically pulling all levers to make sure that we make meat available to our consumers as fast as we can. We believe that right now, the way we are seeing the outlook for Q2 is actually manageable with the information that we share with you. Thanks for the question. Let me just tell you, first, in terms of our overall promotion strategy in the U.S. and then I'll have Paulo ask some additional information. When we look at the world as I mentioned earlier, we saw that initially, the \u2013 because of the tightness of the inventories at the moment of the search that occur, we actually were able to work with our customers to reduce our promotional spending. We were very specific about where the places that we were actually going to reduce their promotional spend and then work with our customers to then say, as inventories improve and we go forward, we'll be able to then judiciously bring those promotions back into the pipeline in the year to go events that we were looking at. So that it continues to be a valuation. I think where we are in constant communication with our customer, which actually has only improved the way we are managing through this together to make sure we have the right availability of product at the right promotional events only as the customers that needed to be the particular situation that they're facing. Paulo, if you want to add something?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I'd now like to hand the conference over to Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Jakubik: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at The Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our fourth quarter 2021 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted on ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. With that, let's take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: 2 questions for me. The first one for Miguel. Just given how fluid the environment is using, I guess, Paolo's words and just the macro pressures that we're seeing in the market, how has that impacted your ability to execute? And are you not executing as an organization, I guess, up to or as well as you would like, just given all the pressure?\nMiguel Patricio: Bryan, thanks for the question. I mean, the macro pressures that you are mentioning, they've been here for a while now. And at the beginning, it was hard to adapt. But I think that this is the new normal, and we are absolutely embracing the change of the macro pressures every day. I'm personally very confident about the path forward. First, because of our people. We have today a great team, a very engaged and with a low turnover, which is very different from 2.5 years ago. Our business is growing and we've been relatively strong when we talk about gross margins despite the inflation that we are seeing, which in a way has enabled us to keep investing in our brands, and our cash flow and balance sheet is almost much, much stronger than 2 years ago.  Now moving forward, I think that what we have to do is even to accelerate the path and the speed to accelerate profitable growth and unlock greater efficiencies. But on that one, I will leave for the CAGNY for us to speak a little bit more next week. Thank you for the question, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: All right. And then, Paulo, I wanted to just ask if you could give us a little bit more help with phasing for the year. And I guess more specifically, as we're looking at the first half, are there anything we should consider? I guess we're thinking about first quarter versus second quarter in terms of, I don't know, is inflation more pronounced earlier in the year, the impact of pricing to help offset inflation like how that flows? And also in the prepared remarks, you talked a bit about or there was some discussion about supply chain. So are some of the supply chain disruptions may be more pronounced earlier in the year or earlier in the first half than the back half. So just any help you can give us in terms of the shape of the quarters would be really helpful.\nPaulo Basilio: Sure, Bryan. So if -- stepping back a little bit, like we closed 2021 very strong. Our EBITDA was $6.37 billion. And in this number, we had approximately $400 million of divested business, okay? So we start from there. We are going to see -- we are expecting to see the benefit of our sales growth, the combination of pricing plus efficiencies that we have in our plan, mitigating the inflation, the higher inflation that we are seeing. And also we expect some headwind from volume mix, and we are assuming a more conservative levels of consumption and elasticities as the stimulus and government support states, okay? And again, as you said, we are expecting closer to 47, 53, H1, H2, and this reflects where we are currently on the inflation versus the price curve that we are implementing. Also, the recovery, as you mentioned, of the supply chain constraints that we have that we expect this to improve through the first half. There is also here in terms of the curve, we are going to have this year 53rd week that will benefit our Q4 in the magnitude of $60 million to $70 million. That's what we're expecting. And in terms of inside the first half between Q1 and Q2, we expect Q1 to be softer in relation to Q2 because of the timing of Easter shipments that we're going to have this year and also the timing that we are executing our pricing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: I was hoping to get a bit more clarity on the various buckets you broke out in the prepared remarks with respect to the supply chain constraints and market share. Maybe could you be a bit more specific on sort of what the one-time issues were in the fourth quarter and why you've got visibility to this being fixed by the end of Q1. Is the second bucket you mentioned of supply constraints simply demand outstripping supply and not necessarily execution-related? And then the third bucket, I assume are brands that are losing share for other reasons than supply constraints. So maybe if you can just sort of give us a little more clarity on those 3 buckets, that would be really helpful.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Andrew, and it's Carlos and I'm happy to take it. So as you said in the prepared remarks, I broke this out, but let me give you a little more color on each of those. So firstly, the 40% of our share loss in Q4 was, as you said, was due to one-time supply and similar challenges. And what I mean by that, it seems like we saw in places where Philadelphia Cream Cheese, for example, given some packages issues that we had that we know what happened. Those are related more to whether with packaging materials in the case of Cream Cheese, whether it was labor in case of Oscar Mayer Bacon, so we have visibility on those, and we know that we are able to actually come back and recover in Q1. The second bucket is around the 30% that was really due to more -- think of those as more production constraints that we actually expect to resolve in the first half to exit them in a good place as we end Q2. And those are things where the actual production was driving the constraint. So think of those as Heinz Gravy where capacity is limited, and we were able -- but we are now doing things in order to free capacity to work service the high demand that we're seeing, whether that was in places like launchables where we have some ongoing labor constraints that we are solving and we'll be able to, again, execute to in a much better way. And then the third bucket, in some essentially is they are in categories and frankly, they're tilted towards growth in categories where we're actually looking to implement new game plans this year. And think of those essentially as new creative ways in which we can deliver a strong demand. And when you put it all together, I can tell you that we have the clear visibility on what needs to be done, and we actually have clear actions as well to make sure it happens. So we feel very good as we exit both Q1 and Q2 to recover this. So thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: I just had a quick question for you to understand, and I think this kind of follows on your answer there, Carlos, on Andrew's question. The production constraints you had, I think you said like 30% of the share losses. Can you help quantify like what that -- how much that weighed on sales, what the listing opportunity was in the quarter? And then I also -- I'm just curious around that. You did talk about in your prepared remarks -- the pre-recorded remarks about a real focus on market share in 2022. So I just want to get a better sense of kind of your expectations there and then how that could affect, say, volume and pricing and promotional efforts, that kind of thing, for the coming year?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: First of all, thank you for the question. I would say I think it's a little bit difficult to quantify the share to the volume. What I can tell you is those are in the last 30%, those are categories, again, that we continue to see opportunity for us to service the consumer demand in a stronger way. So we have something that is focused for us. And we are -- the reality is that we have been -- we are actually thinking through very creative ways in which we can actually satisfy that demand going forward. And to your point around our focus on share, absolutely. For us, it's something that we as a company take very seriously. We mentioned the fact that we have great bright spots within our business, big iconic brands that have been growing quite a bit of share. But as we think about going forward, we want to make sure that it's consistently across our businesses and us being able to deal with recovery, both in Q1 and Q2 as we exit the first half is going to help us actually continue to grow in that perspective.\nChris Growe: If I could just add any -- sorry, go ahead.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Please. No, go ahead.\nChris Growe: Okay. Just real quickly just at many times a focus on market share can imply heavier promotional spending or those kinds of things. It sounds like you've got more new product innovation, those advertising, those kind of consumer pull more than a consumer push to generate that market share. Is that fair to say?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Listen, I think for me, whenever I talk about market share, think of it as profitable market share. I've been working in food company for a number of years. And there is no substitute to make sure that we -- whenever we think about market share, it has to be done in a proper way. We have to make sure we do -- everything that we do is with a consumer-first approach to make sure we, in fact, bringing consumer solutions, whether that is location-based, in-store and online, we'll always focus on making sure that it's done with a drive on profitable market share growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Can we ask about what came through better than expected in the fourth quarter. When you reported at the end of October, you were talking about adjusted EBITDA, I think, in the $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion range, and it came through at $6.4 billion. That's a big step-up for the last couple of months of the year. So could you just walk us through what the positive surprises were and whether those are likely to continue?\nPaulo Basilio: I think -- Alexia, Paulo here. I think I can take this one. I think we saw -- we were able to, even with many constraints, we were able to produce better. It's fair to say that if we're able to -- if we had more capacity, would have sold even more, but we were able to operate in terms of volume and capacity better than we planned. And also our promotion strategy came in better than we promoted less than we were expecting initially. I think those 2 areas together with over-delivering in terms of efficiencies, I would add to this third point were the main factors to our strong performance in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: Just a question and the commentary around expected stronger consumption in '22. Obviously, that's despite higher pricing and you said you're being somewhat conservative, it sounds like on the volume side as you look to your internal forecast. I'm just curious, when you come up with those forecasts, as we think about like back half of the year, is the feel that you might just be a little bit better positioned given price points, maybe a little bit more -- or let's say, better position with respect to trade down risk? I'm just trying to get a sense as to why you think consumption would actually be up at least in the at-home channel. And then I have a quick follow-up.\nPaulo Basilio: Right. I can start here and maybe Carlos can complement if he feels the need. What we have embedded in our outlook is that we are -- again, we are going to -- we expect, as we said, low single-digit organic sales growth in this year with greater contribution from the growth platforms that we have. Our foodservice channel is also recovering and gaining share in all the emerging markets performance and our continued strong performance through distribution. And also, as I was mentioning before, some relief of the key supply chain constraints that -- as the year progresses. But we -- as we were discussing, we also are embedded in our forecast, in our expectation, some headwinds in volume and in fact, in volume '22 because we are taking into consideration the fact that we are going to be having stems from the government support that happened and also a more conservative levels of elasticity than we saw before. But net-net, so that is that we are -- we have assumptions that are more conservative in terms of elasticity and consumption that we're seeing today, but we think it is the appropriate way to go in our outlook.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. The one thing, I guess, I would add to what Paulo just said is that as we're doing that, we also continue to make investments to make sure we improve our brand value proposition. And we're doing that through renovation of our brands, driving disruptive innovation and continue to service new occasion-based solutions, whether that's for in-store, online for today's consumers' needs. So that continues even as we are continuing to progress throughout the year. Thanks for the question.\nRob Dickerson: Super. And then very quickly, Paulo, you've done a very nice job of improving your leverage positioning at the end of the year still with a decent cash balance. Should we just be thinking as you go forward that kind of use of cash would either be for kind of smaller add-on acquisitions or just kind of an ongoing deleverage cycle as you get through '22? That's it.\nPaulo Basilio: Sure. We -- our leverage target is below 4x, and we are well below that level today. And we expect to remain consistently below that going forward. Just want to highlight 1 point here, investment grade for us remains really strategically important and we have enough flexibility today in our balance sheet, in our capital structure to continue to evaluate opportunities to accelerate our strategy in an accretive way and with price discipline. But we are really closing now the way that we are today in terms of flexibility in the balance sheet that we have we feel the company in a very strong position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman: Can you comment on where overall inflation came in for 2021? And what assumption you're making for inflation in '22? And then I guess, just how much of your costs are covered for the year and what your visibility is on the cost outlook?\nPaulo Basilio: Sure. So let me take that. Our Q4 inflation were higher than we expected in our October call. We ended up like with a low double digit. But for 2022, we are likely to see or expecting today near inflation of low teens for the full year, okay? And we expect this inflation to be higher in the first half than in the second half. And just to complement the -- by the end of next -- last year in '21, we took the necessary actions to mitigate the inflation we were seeing. And since then, more inflation has come and we are taking these additional actions as we've been discussing. And we are -- when you look about -- in terms of our hedging position, we normally hedge -- although we hedge a more significant part of the commodities, when you talk about our total COGS, we only hedge around 20% to 30% of the COGS. So -- because there are a lot of other costs that are not only commodities in our cost. So again, that is the range that we have ahead. So it's not material when we have a situation that we're having today that we are seeing inflation in pretty much all the lines of our COGS.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: I'm curious in your guidance for 2022, how much does the outlook require or bake in, I guess, what I would consider rational behavior from your competitors? In other words, are there any assumptions that as the consumer maybe gets a little bit more stretched as prices rise a little bit as some of your competitors also add to their capacity. Is there any expectation built in that there might be -- yes, you talked about elasticity certainly being there, but maybe a little bit more of an aggressive stance from some of your rivals. I'm just trying to get a sense for what's baked in.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The other thing, I think that -- I'm not going to comment on what they're doing, how they're going to run their business. So let me tell you a little bit about how I see our business and why I feel good about the way kind of we think about us going forward. For us, the important thing is to make sure we continue to stay investing it in a differentiated portfolio. And we're doing this because we actually are able to provide consumers whether it's an entry into the category, a mainstream product or premium products, consumers actually have a way in which to acquire product from Kraft Heinz. And you see that in places like Mac & Cheese, where it goes from an Easy Mac to the original version of Mac & Cheese. We also are continuing to strengthen our portfolio because, as you know, we have made some important divestitures that really have reduced kind of our exposures to private label and other places where historically have been more competitive. In fact, we've gone from 17% of exposure to private label to now 11, which -- and I think its industry average is around 20%. So we also -- we only -- we are making investments. We have a place in which consumers can come into the category. We're less exposed to historically private level businesses. And we continue to make sure we're offering great quality products at prices that consumers can afford. So we are focused on making sure that everything we're doing is around delivering great value, meaning quality products and a way that is accessible to consumers. That's what we're focused here in Kraft Heinz.\nKen Goldman: Makes sense. And then very quickly -- Paulo, thank you. For the gross margin, the Street is modeling a pretty flattish figure in 2022 versus '21. Recognizing you don't provide specific guidance for this line item, just directionally, I guess, is it fair to say that gross margin is more likely to be down than flat? Just especially in light of, I guess, your reminder this morning that in the context of inflation, you're aiming to recapture gross profit dollars, not necessarily percentages?\nPaulo Basilio: Yes. Listen, when you think about as costs stabilize and price realization and efficiencies continue, our margin percentage here will normalize, okay? As we have mentioned before, we are expecting lower run rate margin percentage levels in the beginning of this year and our actions are to protect the dollar profitability. So we are protecting the dollar margin year-over-year. That's how we are thinking here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Following up on the topic of elasticity, I just wonder if you could provide any more context in terms of your assumptions for the coming year in that regard. And really, any variation you're thinking about and we should be thinking about, about how elasticity is anticipated to maybe very across your platforms or across your geographic regions?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: I think, I'm guessing that you're referring mostly to our U.S. business. So let me just take that up first. I think so far, and Paulo spoke to this a little bit earlier, other expectation for elasticity have proven to be conservative. So as we go forward, we're expecting some of those more, I would say, normal levels of elasticity to impact in 2022. And just to be clear, our outlook contemplates both those elevated levels of elasticity and the continued investments on our brand value proposition. Now when you look at overall kind of how the way we look at the business is that demand really has remained pretty much intact. So the inflation, which is, as you know, being broad-based and not specific to one category is really kind of impacting everywhere similarly. Now if you look at it deeper, personal spending on food has been more stable than disposable income or even discretionary spending over time. And if you go even further, when you look at Kraft Heinz specifically, the reality is that we have, as I said earlier, quality products in categories in which we can compete at a price that is affordable to consumers. I mean just to give you a sense, I mean, when you think about Kraft Mac & Cheese, Blue Box is about $0.50 per serving. If you think about Oscar Mayer hot dogs, it's about $0.25 a piece. If you think about Heinz Ketchup, it's about $0.10 an ounce. So those are things that we continue to feel strong about because we have a way in which to create great quality products in a way that consumers can afford. But we're also taking more actions than that. We also are using our designed to value to make sure that we're thinking around how do we boost quality in our products while reducing cost, essentially making sure that we give consumers exactly what they're looking for and not the things they don't need. And lastly, we're also making sure that we're investing in better creative and communication so that we have, in fact, stronger relevance of our brands that actually are helping us make sure that we continue to drive better renovations, innovations in a way that matters to what consumers are looking for today.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Great. If I could follow up on a different topic actually. There\u2019s a good deal of discussion about your strategy to expand and drive growth in emerging markets. And I guess as we think about the strategic investments that you\u2019ve embedded in the \u201822 plan. Can you just talk about the sort of the allocation of those investments in your developed markets versus your emerging markets? And just how much of an accelerated push towards the emerging markets you\u2019re thinking about and we should be thinking about as it relates to the new year?\nRafael Oliveira: Maybe I can take it here, it\u2019s Rafa speaking. Look, we continue to be very optimistic of our strategy we focus on emerging markets, right, on Taste Elevation. And \u2013 I mean, we continue to expect double-digit organic growth, further gains of market share in the future and leveraging our repeatable go-to-market model. I mean this has been live in about 30% of the countries we operate today in emerging markets, and we look to continue growing this and boosting our go-to-market for the -- in 2022. So I mean, the strategy remains the same. We\u2019ll play the \u2013 as we\u2019ve been doing, we did 4 acquisitions in 2021 and add-ons in different markets that enable us to expand within our Taste Elevation focus in specific countries that we see a big opportunity for growth. So that strategy should remain is paying off and we will continue.\nA \u2013Miguel Patricio: And Rafael, I would just add that the engine for growth in these emerging markets is really the brand Heinz that is an unbelievable shape and getting better every day from a consumer standpoint, which gives us a lot of opportunities for growth to expand Heinz further, not only Ketchup, but other products. So emerging markets will continue being a great engine of our growth.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to pass the call back to Chris Jakubik for closing remarks.\nChris Jakubik: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. For follow-up questions, myself and the rest of the IR team will be available for any additional questions. But thanks again for joining us today, and we'll see you at CAGNY next week.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and it's Carlos and I'm happy to take it. So as you said in the prepared remarks, I broke this out, but let me give you a little more color on each of those. So firstly, the 40% of our share loss in Q4 was, as you said, was due to one-time supply and similar challenges. And what I mean by that, it seems like we saw in places where Philadelphia Cream Cheese, for example, given some packages issues that we had that we know what happened. Those are related more to whether with packaging materials in the case of Cream Cheese, whether it was labor in case of Oscar Mayer Bacon, so we have visibility on those, and we know that we are able to actually come back and recover in Q1. The second bucket is around the 30% that was really due to more -- think of those as more production constraints that we actually expect to resolve in the first half to exit them in a good place as we end Q2. And those are things where the actual production was driving the constraint. So think of those as Heinz Gravy where capacity is limited, and we were able -- but we are now doing things in order to free capacity to work service the high demand that we're seeing, whether that was in places like launchables where we have some ongoing labor constraints that we are solving and we'll be able to, again, execute to in a much better way. And then the third bucket, in some essentially is they are in categories and frankly, they're tilted towards growth in categories where we're actually looking to implement new game plans this year. And think of those essentially as new creative ways in which we can deliver a strong demand. And when you put it all together, I can tell you that we have the clear visibility on what needs to be done, and we actually have clear actions as well to make sure it happens. So we feel very good as we exit both Q1 and Q2 to recover this. So thank you. First of all, thank you for the question. I would say I think it's a little bit difficult to quantify the share to the volume. What I can tell you is those are in the last 30%, those are categories, again, that we continue to see opportunity for us to service the consumer demand in a stronger way. So we have something that is focused for us. And we are -- the reality is that we have been -- we are actually thinking through very creative ways in which we can actually satisfy that demand going forward. And to your point around our focus on share, absolutely. For us, it's something that we as a company take very seriously. We mentioned the fact that we have great bright spots within our business, big iconic brands that have been growing quite a bit of share. But as we think about going forward, we want to make sure that it's consistently across our businesses and us being able to deal with recovery, both in Q1 and Q2 as we exit the first half is going to help us actually continue to grow in that perspective. Please. No, go ahead. Listen, I think for me, whenever I talk about market share, think of it as profitable market share. I've been working in food company for a number of years. And there is no substitute to make sure that we -- whenever we think about market share, it has to be done in a proper way. We have to make sure we do -- everything that we do is with a consumer-first approach to make sure we, in fact, bringing consumer solutions, whether that is location-based, in-store and online, we'll always focus on making sure that it's done with a drive on profitable market share growth.

And we're doing that through renovation of our brands, driving disruptive innovation and continue to service new occasion-based solutions, whether that's for in-store, online for today's consumers' needs. So that continues even as we are continuing to progress throughout the year. Thanks for the question. The other thing, I think that -- I'm not going to comment on what they're doing, how they're going to run their business. So let me tell you a little bit about how I see our business and why I feel good about the way kind of we think about us going forward. For us, the important thing is to make sure we continue to stay investing it in a differentiated portfolio.

            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Bryan, thanks for the question. I mean, the macro pressures that you are mentioning, they've been here for a while now. And at the beginning, it was hard to adapt. But I think that this is the new normal, and we are absolutely embracing the change of the macro pressures every day. I'm personally very confident about the path forward. First, because of our people. We have today a great team, a very engaged and with a low turnover, which is very different from 2.5 years ago. Our business is growing and we've been relatively strong when we talk about gross margins despite the inflation that we are seeing, which in a way has enabled us to keep investing in our brands, and our cash flow and balance sheet is almost much, much stronger than 2 years ago.  Now moving forward, I think that what we have to do is even to accelerate the path and the speed to accelerate profitable growth and unlock greater efficiencies. But on that one, I will leave for the CAGNY for us to speak a little bit more next week. Thank you for the question, Bryan."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Sure, Bryan. So if -- stepping back a little bit, like we closed 2021 very strong. Our EBITDA was $6.37 billion. And in this number, we had approximately $400 million of divested business, okay? So we start from there. We are going to see -- we are expecting to see the benefit of our sales growth, the combination of pricing plus efficiencies that we have in our plan, mitigating the inflation, the higher inflation that we are seeing. And also we expect some headwind from volume mix, and we are assuming a more conservative levels of consumption and elasticities as the stimulus and government support states, okay? And again, as you said, we are expecting closer to 47, 53, H1, H2, and this reflects where we are currently on the inflation versus the price curve that we are implementing. Also, the recovery, as you mentioned, of the supply chain constraints that we have that we expect this to improve through the first half. There is also here in terms of the curve, we are going to have this year 53rd week that will benefit our Q4 in the magnitude of $60 million to $70 million. That's what we're expecting. And in terms of inside the first half between Q1 and Q2, we expect Q1 to be softer in relation to Q2 because of the timing of Easter shipments that we're going to have this year and also the timing that we are executing our pricing. I think -- Alexia, Paulo here. I think I can take this one. I think we saw -- we were able to, even with many constraints, we were able to produce better. It's fair to say that if we're able to -- if we had more capacity, would have sold even more, but we were able to operate in terms of volume and capacity better than we planned.

As we have mentioned before, we are expecting lower run rate margin percentage levels in the beginning of this year and our actions are to protect the dollar profitability. So we are protecting the dollar margin year-over-year. That's how we are thinking here."

After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Jakubik: Thank you. And hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at The Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our third quarter 2021 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss the non-GAAP financial measures today during the call. And these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you Chris, and good morning everyone. I would just like to start by sharing how encouraging it is for us to see our Company leaning into a scale and agility that we have been talking about for some time, addressing short-term challenges at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage. We are today a much stronger Company and we are better positioned to address inflation that we're seeing. We are taking actions now to protect profitability through 2022 and our actions, and not just branching, we are also implementing price pack architecture, value-engineering, and leveraging our scaling procurement. At the same time, our team has continued transforming our business for long-term growth and advantage.  Our momentum with the consumer is strong, and our consumer-focused platform-based approach is taking us to new occasions. We continue to invest, to improve relevance of our brands. They are making greater, more creative marketing investments. And at the same time, we are building agility that will deliver the 2 billion of gross efficiencies and looking to unlock more. We are continuing to pay down debt and improve our net leverage. And we continue to invest in our most important assets, our people. And as we mentioned in our remarks, we have done all of these while delivering better 2021 results than previously expected, which speaks to the strength of our business. Well, with that, let's take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. My question is actually for Rafa, if I could. We've been taking a look at some Nielsen trends and some key food categories in the U.S. and Western Europe. And while consumption obviously in the U.S. has certainly remained elevated, trends at least in some categories in Europe seems to be decelerating meaningfully, or I guess normalizing is a better word for it as those markets reopen at a faster pace than what we've seen here in the U.S. So I'm curious if KHC is seeing this dynamic play out at all for the Company, and if you see maybe certain trends in Europe as a fair leading indicator of what's to come in the U.S. around stickiness of demand. Or if maybe there are some differences suggesting that not a great set of data points to necessarily use to compare. Thanks so much.\nRafael Oliveira: Hi, Andrew. Rafa, here. Thanks for the question. From an overall market perspective in Western Europe, we have seen indeed more of a return to pre -pandemic consumption patterns than in other developed markets. That said, there is quite a bit per category, and we are seeing much greater stickiness in our base elevation platforms as the consumers continue to look to us to elevate their views. And this is quite positive to be honest to us, because if you recall, we have three key pillars on our international growth strategy and our base elevation platform, emerging markets and food service channel. So these demand stickiness in base elevation, and we will continue to see favorable levels of consumption, growth, and absolute terms on the platform. And we do the best when we are focusing at. So we continue to see this elevation demand sustaining. And in food service in particular, Western Europe is rebounding very fast. It is approaching 2019 levels. And on top of this, I agree we've been gaining a lot of share in almost every market in -- we operate in food service, so is another strength. As I said, overall, it's true is most of the market is coming back to pre -pandemic. In some platforms, they continue to be very strong and that has played out favorably for us, this elevation.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Thanks, folks. Appreciate you slotting me in. I guess I'll lean into price a little bit. You reiterated the comment today that during the prepared remarks that you expect the price to catch up with costs by the end of the year. Can you confirm that that's not just ingredient costs, but that's sort of the total supply chain pressure? And then looking at slide 8, is it fair to look at that as a price index? So, to say you came into the year with the index around 103 and you plan to exit a bit north of 106, you'd be carrying around 3 points of price into next year, or is that 106 a bit of an average and the real exit rates closer to 107 or 108? Thanks.\nPaulo Basilio: Hi, Jason, I'm Paulo, here. Let me try to help with this question. We expect to see similar level of inflation at the beginning of '22 as we are seeing now in the second half of '21. Most of the inflation that we're going to see is carried over for '21. We expect to enter '22 having executed the price plan that protects our profitability from current levels of cost. Current levels of cost that we're seeing now. And this should address the inflation that's expected in '22. So we are seeing our execution of pricing, protecting our profitability given the cost levels that we're seeing now and this should protect our profitability when we're entering into '22.\nJason English: So we're probably looking at something closer to a mid-single-digit pricing as we enter next year if you're carrying high single-digits percent of COGS. That's just that the math on that. Is that unreasonable?\nPaulo Basilio: Listen, I don't want to get into the actual forecasting of pricing but I can tell you that the actions that we're taking now will protect the inflation that we're seeing, and it will protect our profitability from these inflation that we're seeing in the current cost levels. And this could put us in a good position to enter 2022.\nJason English: Okay.\nMiguel Patricio: Just complementing what Paulo is saying. I think that if eventually more inflation terms, well we'll have to take action.\nJason English: Sure. It makes sense. And congrats on the pricing success so far. It's better than I expected.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nChris Jakubik: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning.\nMiguel Patricio: Morning.\nPamela Kaufman: Can you elaborate on what drove the sequential softening in market share trends that you highlighted? Has that primarily been driven by the capacity constraints or have there been other competitive dynamics contributing to the share performance? And then how are you addressing the capacity constraints that you highlighted, and I guess, what do you see is driving improved share performance going forward?\nRafael Oliveira: Thank you Pamela (ph) for the question. I imagine a lot of those questions you had there, I think there were 3 I counted, but they were related to the U.S. so I'll take it. I guess for me I will say, yes, first of all, the way I think about the business is we want to make sure we continue to drive household penetration and repeat rates, which we are doing. And while there were some short-term share pressures, and during the back-to-school as really their demand really out grew in our capacity in a few categories, over the long term effect that we are driving household penetration and repeat rates shows the strength of our portfolio interest of our business on how we are actually managed through all that.\nMiguel Patricio: But I will say yes to that. I'm very much focused on making sure that we win by maximizing the controls. And our recipe for winning is to be essentially consistent with focus on solidifying the consumer needs better than anyone else, and it doesn't matter exactly what's happening at this particular moment. As we go forward, I'd tell you, I see three specific advantage that for us it's going to be a play which we're going to win. We have continued to renovate our portfolio, we have controlled the cost in our brands so that we can optimize the value with our -- for our consumers and really that is the best recipe for us to withstand against any competition that comes in. And essentially what we are doing -- we're increasing the equation of what it's worth buying for at the shelf. The second event is where we have also -- we're making sure that we are differentiated at each rung of the price ladder, whether its entry to mainstream to premium so that consumers can stay within our franchise even if their circumstances might change. And if you think about Mac and Cheese, we've got everywhere from an easy mac to the original version for consumers. And then the third piece I will say is we are transforming our portfolio through all these divestitures that actually have a significantly reduce our private level exposure. So we have continued to renovate and manage our costs. We have continued to bring -- making sure that we have differentiated products within our categories no matter where the frequent consumers are. And we have a private -- we have a portfolio that is mostly going to reduce this private label. And frankly, we continue to see opportunities to capture profitable growth focusing on our consumer platforms. So we are executing with excellence and leveraging this broad renovation, the innovation, and the rest is creating that our teams are doing. I think, Pamela, you also spoke a part of your question within other supply chain constraints that we're seeing. I think the way I would look at it is, across the industry we're seeing a supply chain that is being tested on a daily basis. And what I will say is our supplying chain team has been very agile, taking advantage of our global scale. We're showing agility in labor, in manufacturing in logistics and I will give you some examples of what I mean. We are reducing the amount of time to hire and significantly increase the applicant pool by leveraging new digital tools at Kraft Heinz. We are improving the flexibility in terms of the materials that are available with a reeling ownership mindset across sales, procurement, and manufacturing.\nCarlos Abrams Rivera: And those things will change in our plans, 39 of them across the U.S. sometimes on a weekly basis. And then, in logistics we've actually increased the throughput on warehouses by shifting more of how we operate 24/7 and increasing the automations since the pre -pandemic time. So having said that, I will tell you that we do have a good line of sight of continue to improve our customer service levels as we move forward. And because frankly, restoring the top-tier customer service to the pre-pandemic level is a continued focus for us and the entire team. And thanks for your question, Pamela.\nMiguel Patricio: You also asked about moving forward in terms of capacity. On top of everything that the Carlos is saying, I just to add to that, we have been adding capacity. We increased substantially Heinz ketchup capacity, Mac and Cheese, on frozen snacks, [Indiscernible] max and bagel bites, on crops of cucumbers, on meal, and on kid's juices. So it's -- this investment in capacities is a great proof on our belief about the demand for our products in the future.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please, go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. So my question is, I guess, tied to some of the themes here, just in terms of inflation and pricing and margins. Maybe if we could just step back pre all of this inflation and pre -COVID, there was a transformation in your supply chain in which that work had started. We look at gross margins or profitability of the gross profit line, and you've held up pretty well, relative to your peers; if anything, probably a little bit better. I guess as we're thinking about profitability going forward, knowing that there's some pricing that's coming through to cover inflation. But how much are you also still benefiting incrementally from some of the supply chain work you've done, and how much of that is going to be also a contributor to helping to offset all of the inflation and supply chain disruptions?\nPaulo Basilio: Let me start here and then we can maybe build -- someone else here can put -- build on top of my answer. What you said is true. When we come back to when the time that in 2019 when we close our strategy beginning of 2020, the -- we were very focused on improving our gross profit overtime. And in order to do that, we developed on many programs in terms of efficiencies in supply chain, in terms of focusing on these -- also pricing. A new pricing strategy and revenue management strategy and this is taking place. You can see that today with all the inflationary pressure that we're seeing in the gap that we're having between the pricing realization and the cost inflation, we're keeping the gross profit margin, the same level that we had pre -pandemic. And this gives us a lot of confidence in our brand going forward. So I will say that our strategy to improve profitability, to gross profit margin is working.\nCarlos Abrams Rivera: What I would add to and think about our overall progress in our transformation, in -- both in terms of some of the things that you heard from Miguel earlier. We are in fact, making a significant portion on fast-track in critical projects on our capacity. So as Miguel give you some examples, I will give you a couple of more, which is if you think about ketchup, the fact that in Heinz dip and squeeze kind of shares a small package, we have nearly doubled our capacity and by the end of next year, if you think about Mac and Cheese, by the second half of next year, we've actually increased about 20% of our cups' capacity and even in Frozen snacks, by -- also by second half of next year, we will have increased about a third our capacity in areas like daily mix. And so both across -- this are some of the examples of things that we saw earlier in the pandemic. We made fast-tracking of projects and we continue to do that, more work to do ahead. The other way I look at it is in terms of our -- how do we make sure we get more of our utilization of our assets and for me, things like improving our OEE, which we have now done '20 versus '21, and -- I'm sorry, '20 versus '19, '21 versus '20. It is also the way that we're going to continue to make sure that as we go forward, we attack in both ways, making sure that we are being smart about investing in our capacity. And we're getting more of our assets through improvements in our OEE. Thanks for your question, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to try to square the outlook for 2022 slide with your comments about pricing catching up to costs. Because if pricing is really catching up the cost that would imply that your EBITDA growth on a core basis divestitures should be able to grow in 2022. So if you're confident enough that the pricing is really catching up, why not take the extra step and, and talk about it in your outlook? As it stands, the slide is pretty general. It says that things are going to be strong, stronger than you thought post-pandemic but I'm not quite sure it points to EBITDA growth on a core basis yet.\nPaulo Basilio: Hi Rob. Let me start saying that we are not providing guidance for '22 and we're not providing also at this time any outlook for '22 besides the ones that we shared. We can say that we are very confident with our bets and we're very confident about our ability to retain consumers and retain volume that we're having today. And we're also confident in our ability to sustain these strong margins that we have. We -- our focus here is to protect the margin dollars from inflation as we mentioned and again, to give you a little bit more color if you can say that, and also we shared that in Q3, and we discussed that in Q3, we have lower the rate percentage margins and we expect these margins to improve as profit realization comes. But that is as far as we'll go in 2022. We're very confident with the fact that we have -- we are in a better space. We are a better Company in a better space with stronger consumption and with confidence in our ability to price the short debt inflation that we're seeing.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Thank you,\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning. I just had a question for you in relation to promotions and you've talked about how you're rebuilding promotions in your business, especially in the US. I think you talked about a normalized promotional environment. So I just want to understand, and this gets back to a degree around pricing, as you recover promotions, especially against the period a year ago where they were lower, can you achieve price realization on a net basis that offsets inflation? And maybe related to that, would that rebuilding promotion or recovering promotion continue in the first half of 2022? Maybe a bit of an offset to the pricing you're taking in retail.\nCarlos Abrams Rivera: So Chris, let me answer that and try to explain. I think there are a couple of things you mentioned in your question. First, let me just put into context of the transformation that we've been having here at Kraft Heinz. I mean, if you think back, a critical aspect of our transformation is a consumer first approach to all that we do so -- which essentially is why our plan is to invest behind our consumer platforms during those even t windows where actually consumers are looking to us for solutions. So if we think about the gains that we have made so far, the fact that we have continued to drive brand household penetration and repeat rate, it is exactly because we have done that. We have been able to make sure that in moments during the year that consumers are looking for those specific solutions, that we can offer, essentially, the scale of what we -- of our products in a way that satisfies their needs better than anyone else. And we have been and expect to be as we look into 2022, more active with better execution than 2020 during this critical windows, but clearly not as deep as we were in 2019. And frankly, we continued to see opportunities to capture the growth. So as we are going to move forward, we are going to remain diligent on making sure [Indiscernible] satisfies our consumer needs better than anyone else, guided by our platform and our renewed focus on making sure that again, everything we do, as far as transformation, is with that consumer-first approach. Thank you.\nChris Growe: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. So in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an appetite for more acquisitions in the emerging markets. I think you referenced the FM Foods and the [Indiscernible] deals that you've done so far. Can you talk a little bit about what additional or where you're focused in terms of potential future deals? Are there particular categories, particular regions that you're looking at? Can you say anything about the kind of scale of the pipeline in terms of which would you be looking just at tuck-ins or potentially something more medium sized? Thank you. and I'll pass it on.\nMiguel Patricio: Sure, Alexia. Maybe I can comment and then give the word to to Rafael, since he's responsible for emerging markets, among other things. We have, of course, today a portfolio that is better than we had 2 years ago and a much stronger balance sheet. And with that comes more flexibility, right? And you are right. I think that if we have opportunities for acquisitions, we'll look at them and always with price discipline. We like a lot to follow our strategy and as a consequence, taste elevation, which is the really one of the critical strategic pillar of the strategy of the international zone is in the place where we're looking for opportunities. And that helps also food service business. So yes, some business in Turkey that we acquired is the leading Company in food service. And we expect to grow to the retailers with that place in Turkey as well. And I will give the micro for the word to Rafael so he can give you more color about carriers that we're looking at.\nRafael Oliveira: Yeah. No. Thank you. The reason we are so excited about Assan Foods, about Hemmer is exactly as you have said, it's all strategy. They are strong margin categories in the right countries, as you said, base elevation and emerging markets and food service, those are the pillars for our strategy and what they can enable us in the future. I mean, each of those two businesses, I mentioned Assan and Hemmer. They are just short of a 100 million each. But with Assan we will not only be able to build Heinz as a bigger brand in Turkey, but we'll have capacity to grow much faster across the Middle East. And with Hemmer, I mean, Hemmer, we have announced, but we're now waiting for regulatory approval. It will not only strengthen our distribution, especially, in the south of Brazil, being we'll be able to participate in much more the gradual ladders of the the chain within Taste Elevation. And we can really leverage their portfolio to build our scale faster in [Indiscernible] and the food service channels. So they are definitely like, again, as I said, on strategy and that's what makes it the most exciting is Taste Elevation and within the core emerging markets that we want to grow. [Indiscernible] see a lot of opportunities.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning. A couple of U.S. based food producers, they've suffered through some worker strikes recently. I'm just curious how you're feeling about your labor relations in general at the moment. And I guess how investors should think about the risk, if there is any, of Kraft Heinz perhaps facing some incremental challenges on this front?\nCarlos Abrams Rivera: Okay. Thanks for your question. I'm obviously not going to speak to anybody else's business. What I will tell you is that our teams, as I mentioned earlier, have shown tremendous agility of making sure that we are in fact, continue to have a focus on engagement of our workforce. As we sit here today, what I'll tell you is that we have seen pockets of some places where we've had some labor challenges in terms of shortages, but also they will have been very much focused on a few and isolated locations. As we move forward, I am actually confident that we have been able to actually and we'll continue to manage through specific areas where there have been some isolated situations in which we have had some labor shortages. But in a way that it's actually not a concern for us on a regular basis or on an ongoing basis as we move forward. So actually, I feel very good about where we are and how we continue to manage this in an agile way. I don't -- anything else you went to build up, Miguel?\nMiguel Patricio: No, I think that's -- the only thing I would add is that we've been working hard to improve the engagement of the Company overall and that brings us more confidence about the possible labor issues for the future. At this moment, we don't see any risk of a strike, but that doesn't mean that that's not possible. But we are confident about that.\nCarlos Abrams Rivera: No, I think as Miguel said. I think we're in a good position and really feel good about our -- the way to our teams have handled it and with the agility they have shown during this really difficult time. So thank you. I think we're about out of time there. So you -- we'll end it there. Thanks everyone for joining us today and for anybody who has follow-up questions, I'll be available to take your questions and for anybody in the media, Kathy Krenger and her team will be available for your follow-ups so thanks, everyone and have a great day.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

I would just like to start by sharing how encouraging it is for us to see our Company leaning into a scale and agility that we have been talking about for some time, addressing short-term challenges at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage. We are today a much stronger Company and we are better positioned to address inflation that we're seeing. We are taking actions now to protect profitability through 2022 and our actions, and not just branching, we are also implementing price pack architecture, value-engineering, and leveraging our scaling procurement. At the same time, our team has continued transforming our business for long-term growth and advantage.  Our momentum with the consumer is strong, and our consumer-focused platform-based approach is taking us to new occasions. We continue to invest, to improve relevance of our brands. They are making greater, more creative marketing investments. And at the same time, we are building agility that will deliver the 2 billion of gross efficiencies and looking to unlock more. We are continuing to pay down debt and improve our net leverage. And we continue to invest in our most important assets, our people. And as we mentioned in our remarks, we have done all of these while delivering better 2021 results than previously expected, which speaks to the strength of our business.

From an overall market perspective in Western Europe, we have seen indeed more of a return to pre -pandemic consumption patterns than in other developed markets. That said, there is quite a bit per category, and we are seeing much greater stickiness in our base elevation platforms as the consumers continue to look to us to elevate their views. And this is quite positive to be honest to us, because if you recall, we have three key pillars on our international growth strategy and our base elevation platform, emerging markets and food service channel. So these demand stickiness in base elevation, and we will continue to see favorable levels of consumption, growth, and absolute terms on the platform. And we do the best when we are focusing at. So we continue to see this elevation demand sustaining. And in food service in particular, Western Europe is rebounding very fast. It is approaching 2019 levels. And on top of this, I agree we've been gaining a lot of share in almost every market in -- we operate in food service, so is another strength. As I said, overall, it's true is most of the market is coming back to pre -pandemic. In some platforms, they continue to be very strong and that has played out favorably for us, this elevation.

And so both across -- this are some of the examples of things that we saw earlier in the pandemic. We made fast-tracking of projects and we continue to do that, more work to do ahead. The other way I look at it is in terms of our -- how do we make sure we get more of our utilization of our assets and for me, things like improving our OEE, which we have now done '20 versus '21, and -- I'm sorry, '20 versus '19, '21 versus '20. It is also the way that we're going to continue to make sure that as we go forward, we attack in both ways, making sure that we are being smart about investing in our capacity. And we're getting more of our assets through improvements in our OEE. Thanks for your question, Bryan. So Chris, let me answer that and try to explain. I think there are a couple of things you mentioned in your question. First, let me just put into context of the transformation that we've been having here at Kraft Heinz. I mean, if you think back, a critical aspect of our transformation is a consumer first approach to all that we do so -- which essentially is why our plan is to invest behind our consumer platforms during those even t windows where actually consumers are looking to us for solutions. So if we think about the gains that we have made so far, the fact that we have continued to drive brand household penetration and repeat rate, it is exactly because we have done that. We have been able to make sure that in moments during the year that consumers are looking for those specific solutions, that we can offer, essentially, the scale of what we -- of our products in a way that satisfies their needs better than anyone else. And we have been and expect to be as we look into 2022, more active with better execution than 2020 during this critical windows, but clearly not as deep as we were in 2019. And frankly, we continued to see opportunities to capture the growth. So as we are going to move forward, we are going to remain diligent on making sure [Indiscernible] satisfies our consumer needs better than anyone else, guided by our platform and our renewed focus on making sure that again, everything we do, as far as transformation, is with that consumer-first approach. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for your question. I'm obviously not going to speak to anybody else's business. What I will tell you is that our teams, as I mentioned earlier, have shown tremendous agility of making sure that we are in fact, continue to have a focus on engagement of our workforce. As we sit here today, what I'll tell you is that we have seen pockets of some places where we've had some labor challenges in terms of shortages, but also they will have been very much focused on a few and isolated locations. As we move forward, I am actually confident that we have been able to actually and we'll continue to manage through specific areas where there have been some isolated situations in which we have had some labor shortages. But in a way that it's actually not a concern for us on a regular basis or on an ongoing basis as we move forward. So actually, I feel very good about where we are and how we continue to manage this in an agile way. I don't -- anything else you went to build up, Miguel? No, I think as Miguel said. I think we're in a good position and really feel good about our -- the way to our teams have handled it and with the agility they have shown during this really difficult time. So thank you. I think we're about out of time there. So you -- we'll end it there. Thanks everyone for joining us today and for anybody who has follow-up questions, I'll be available to take your questions and for anybody in the media, Kathy Krenger and her team will be available for your follow-ups so thanks, everyone and have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now have to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Jakubik (ph), Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Jakubik: Thank you. And hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company and welcomes you to our Q&A session for our second quarter of 2021 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties. And these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio for a few quick opening comments. Miguel?\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Chris, and thank you, everyone. I just like to add or summarize and tell you that we are very optimistic about how we're progressing in our transformation at Kraft Heinz. We've been taking advantage of the scale that we have, and we've been building the agility that we need to build a better business for the future. We posted sustainable top line and bottom line gains versus \u201819, and we are encouraged because the strongest growth comes from priority platforms and markets what we call the growth platforms, taste elevation, and in emerging markets. And we continue seeing retail very strong, and we are coming back with food service. It's recovering and recovering fast. Transforming Kraft Heinz is what we all have in mind. And we want to do that, maintaining industry-leading profitability. We are investing more in our brands and better as well building a much more creative Company. We are also on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021 and effectively managing inflation. At the same time, we continued strengthening our portfolio and improving financial flexibility. We're adding capacity to our products to drive, grow, and energize platforms, and in the emerging markets.  We, as you know, closed the Nuts divestiture and we expect to close the Cheese divestiture in the second half of this year. Recently, we acquired Assan Foods in Turkey. It's a very small operation, but is a very important step into our strategy, because it accelerates taste elevation and is in emerging markets. And we continue to pay down debts and improve our net leverage. We continue to expect to have a very good 2021 actually to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February, and that speaks to the strength and potential of our ongoing business. Thank you. We are now ready for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions]. Please standby while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel. You may begin.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning. I just had a quick question for you, if I could please, in relation to pricing, and I was just curious if you could maybe give a little more color around the price realization and how you expect that to kind of build through the second half of the year. And just as a backdrop, as I look across your categories, in some cases Kraft's pricing is above your category, some a little below, but all-in-all, like the IRI data in the U.S. would say, you are pricing at a little slower rate than what the categories are overall. So I'm just curious if that's strategic in helping drive your share gains or if that's just timing and there's more pricing coming in the second half of the year. Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: And thank you for your question. Let me start and then maybe Carlos and Paulo can give you more color on that. As I mentioned on the call, we believe that inflation in our business remains manageable. And even with inflation, we expect to deliver, as I said, a stronger 2021 than we projected before. We continue to invest in our brands at the anticipated levels to drive our transformation, and we will continue to monitor things and take further action if of course is necessary, but Carlos, maybe you can give more color on it and maybe Paulo as well.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure Miguel. Thanks for the question. But first, I think I will say is in the U.S. we have said in the past is that we are proactively managing against the incremental inflation we see. And actually, we feel good about our ability to implement those actions when and where we see the need. So, if you look at inflation we saw in Q2, it is mainly coming from ingredients, things like soybeans, edible oils, packaging, and some transportation as well. And it is very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And most recently, we also saw some increases too but driven by rising [ph] costs and some higher transportation rates. Now from a pricing perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we are restoring key promotional activations to drive the business versus the pandemic-induced pullbacks that we had in 2020. Now, as we have mentioned earlier in the year, our goal continues to be to connect with consumers that now have discovered or rediscovered our brands and drive the repeat rate among those households. So in that context and versus inflation, again we feel good about our ability to achieve the net pricing we need to offset inflation and maintain a strong household and repeat rate. Given that we are renovating our Portfolio to drive better value for consumers, improving the creative content of our marketing, and strengthening and diversifying our media impressions. What I will also add is that we're doing this primarily through four key revenue management initiatives. First, we are optimizing the frequency and depth of our promotion while we'll restore retail activation levels that I discussed in the call. Second, we're doing broad-based pricing actions, which we have announced across our Portfolio. Third, we're continuing to manage key commodity pricing. And lastly, we're using all other revenue management levers, including price pack architecture and managing category price ladders. If you look at our revenue management initiatives, they are guiding our smart trade investments so we can optimize returns on those investments and manage through the current inflationary environment. Now, in the near term, the timing of cost inflation versus price realization may lead to some degree of margin pressure, but this is reflected in an outlook, and we see net pricing and cost coming into balance as we exit the year. And then with that, let me pass it over to Paulo. Any other comments you want to add Paulo?\nPaulo Basilio: Sure, Carlos. I think if you want to explain inflation and pricing from a total Company perspective, so break it down first on inflation. We're going to recall that in April we said that you're expecting inflation in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of COGS, but at the lower end of that range. Since April, our costs have continued to move higher. Now, we're expecting inflation still in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, but now slightly above the midpoint of the mid-single-digit range. Regarding pricing, as we are mentioning and Carlos has just said, we are using multiple revenue management levers including lease price actions to manage inflation, but I think it's important for us to keep in mind that we are going to be facing an unusually difficult pricing comparison in the second half of last year. Just to remind, just for context last year, second half our price was more than 4% higher than the prior year as we pulled back promotion to better protect customer service. In terms of the timing and the pricing realization, while we expect the timing of the cost inflation versus price realization to soften, our margin percentage to lower than the run rate levels in the short term, I think it's important to note that all of those impacts are already considered in the outlook that we have for the year. And again, as we mentioned in the beginning, we're still expecting \u2013 we are now expecting even stronger EBITDA dollars than we anticipated before.\nChris Growe: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. You may begin.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nPaulo Basilio: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you. Can I ask about the gross margin? I know that it doesn't really appear anywhere except in the formal numbers in the press release, but it looks as though it's down about 150 basis points year on year. I imagine that some of that might not be adjusted gross margin. But in a situation of such intense commodity cost pressures, as we're going through now, I am just wondering how you're expecting that to shape out in the back half of the year, possibly out into 2022. Any commentary would be much appreciated. Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Alexia, I can start here with this answer. I think yes, there are some adjustments to make in the gross margin. But when you think about year-over-year, I think we need to remember that we\u2019re going to be left \u2013 we were lapping in Q2 a big quarter last year with the all-pantry loading that happened in the quarter. Our overall margins of the business are very healthy in these Q2. I think in the second quarter, we were able to price, and we had enough pricing to offset, pricing plus our efficiencies were more than enough to offset our inflation that we had, but we work compared to a very heavy mix that we had in the last quarter.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And -- and going forward, how do you expect it to change in the back-half?\nPaulo Basilio: Going forward what is exactly, I think the key components that we are going to see in the back half is that we are going to start to have -- and that's already embedded in our outlook. We're going to start to have the restoration of some promotions that Carlos mentioned. Also, the mix impacts that we're going to see as the year go on. And also, this timing between pricing and pricing realization and inflation will impact our gross profit, but all those impacts are already inside the outlook that we disclosed.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. You may begin.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Good morning and thanks for the question. I guess obviously it's way too early to talk specifics around 2022 as we know much can still change, but I wanted to go back to the slide presented at the Investor Day in September of last year, and from that presentation on the base business, so excluding divestiture impacts, it looks like EBITDA was expected to be roughly flattish in '22 versus '21. And I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, at this stage, would that still be the expectation such that we just have to strip out divestitures to get a sense of it or maybe has the inflation environment and longer-tail to at-home eating benefits shifted this thinking at all? Thanks so much.\nMiguel Patricio: Let me answer and then maybe Paulo, you can bring more precise numbers to Andrew. We are expecting 2022 to be better than the strategic plan that we presented to you. And why is that? I think our transformation is ahead of our plan. We've been beating our plans and our budgets, and we are optimistic and continue investing toward the future. I think it is still too early for us to be talking or to give you guidance about 2022. With all the volatility in the market, I think it's prudent not to go further on that.\nPaulo Basilio: Andrew, just to complement here, I think as the year progresses,as Miguel mentioned, [indiscernible]late in the year, we will be providing more clarity about how we're seeing 2022. We're not discussing this today, but we can say that we see inflation as a consistent theme for us and the industry ahead of '22, and all those initiatives and actions that we are doing in terms of revenue management initiatives to manage the inflation, we're seeing based on expectations that inflation will continue into the next year. I think those initiatives together with our savings program, the $2 billion savings program will be sufficient that together with investments that we're making to improve the relevance of our brands. So again, we are very confident around our ability to manage the inflation and support the investments behind our turnaround as we are exiting '21 and entering '22.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. You may begin.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. So I've got a question, I guess for both Carlos and for Rafa if you could both comment on this. In the quarter or even year-to-date, currently, we're seeing basically all channels are up.  I think that's been one of the surprises as we move through '21 is that, as away from home and food service channels have improved, the at-home consumption has also stayed relatively elevated.  So I guess my question for both of you is just simply, how long do you expect this to continue and I guess, as things normalize, would you expect the foodservice piece of it to really begin to accelerate more and somewhat offset the at-home consumption? So just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about those two channels, especially since right now they're both up.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Listen, first of all, thanks for the question. I think it's very fair. Let me start and then [Indiscernible] give a perspective on international. I think from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still normalizing.  But I have also to say too early to tell how the share of [Indiscernible] between away-from-home and at-home, ultimately, it's going to hold it out. Now recently, it does seem like the old channels are growing, but that's probably no likely to remain the case and that's not built into our expectations.  Now, in terms of our business, what we see is we are optimistic about our plans that we can actually drive sustainable growth in both the retail and the foodservice. And I think it's fair to say that we also have big ambition from the away-from-home business.  We believe food service is actually both a generation of insights and innovation that can actually help in the retail side of the business. And is also capable of driving outsized growth because we have actually put a reduced focus on culinary distribution and channel expansion.  And some of those channel trends, while still normalizing it's still a little bit early to say predicting exactly whether it's all going to happen now. But I do say that I do believe we're going to be stronger versus what we saw pre-pandemic, and essentially for two key reasons.  First, because our foodservice mix favors the QSR. And actually, that stands to recover and we are seeing that are already faster than the rest of the foodservice channel. And we also see that to be more resilient post-pandemic.  And frankly, early in the pandemic, we also made a strategic bet to support that growth in QSR and that bet is paying up. We now have 30% more capacity in our small package of ketchup and sauces, so that actually has been seen to be working.  And secondly, we see a more durable step-up in-home consumption that comes at the expense of other categories and brands without necessarily sacrificing food service recovery and growth. And then lastly, let me just give you a little more color on the away-from-home.  I mentioned that we gained a point of market share, food service recovery begins, and most of that actually was fueled by the actions we took in 3 areas that I mentioned, culinary distribution and new channels.  So in Q2, we actually executed 9 co-branded culinary limited-time offers with QSR partners. Now just one of those was actually so successful because it became part of our permanent menu item and now is going to be in '22.  And if you think about that context of the fact that we've been able to drive those kinds of limited time offers with QSR, in 2019 we had none of those. So, we are certainly driving a different level of execution with QSR.  Now, the second part of that, which is distribution, we actually grew key account by 20% over this Quarter. And then finally, as consumers continue to evolve how they cook and they eat and including the use of meal delivery kits, we're actually inserting our Kraft Heinz brands into that equation.  So, we are working with one popular direct-to-consumer Company to develop things like a recipe specifically for our Philadelphia Cream Cheese as the main ingredient of their products. And that actual product was ordered over 200,000 times by consumers are really an all-time record for that sales partner.  So when you look at it holistically, I feel very optimistic about our away-from-home business and that it actually is going to be a springboard for us to continue to drive retail growth. Now that's a perspective in the U.S. and Rafael (ph), do you want to add something in terms of the international business, how you see it.\nRafael Oliveira: Yes. Thank you, Carlos. And hi, Bryan (ph). Look, on balance, our developed markets are experiencing very similar trends to retail and food service in U.S. and Canada. Emerging markets on the other hand, and foodservice has actually rebounded stronger than in developed markets.  Then in most countries that either had shorter or even stricter lockdowns, that kept their economies open during the pandemic overall. So I mean, the consumption obviously differs country by country, in-home, and out-of-home.  The best of the pandemic lockdown approached vaccine availability changes a lot. And given the delta variant now it's a bit early to tell how the channels -- where the channels will stabilize in the second half.  But all that said, we're seeing a lot of improvements on the retail channels and giving us a lot of confidence that we will come out of the pandemic well-positioned right after the pandemic. On the foodservice side, our mix is even more weighted towards QSR than the U.S. is and this format is recovering very quickly.  So with distribution gains in emerging markets and the potential of the foodservice that we still have across our overall international, I'm still quite optimistic that after the pandemic hence, the net will be quite positive.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, thanks Rafael (ph). Thanks, Carlos.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. You may begin.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks. Would you ever reconsider your policy of not guiding to annual sales and EBITDA. I realize it's been a Company policy for a long time except in rare cases not to give much. But I imagine you could avoid some confusion about let's say, I guess quite good or not quite as good print if outsiders had a basic bar against which to compare results.  And I guess in that way we could give you more credit when you do come in ahead of expectations. Just curious if that's a possibility and I guess there's nothing else to it, probably makes Chris ' life slightly easier too.\nPaulo Basilio: Thanks for the -- thanks for the comment. Again, we will discuss this internally and we will let you know.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. And thanks for slotting me in. A couple of quick questions. So you guys mentioned that you've implemented pricing actions, began to raise those prices. Can you give us -- can you give us some quantification there? Overall, on average, what is the price increase that you're pushing through and how does it vary across the different products?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, let me just say, Jason, that let me give a little bit of more context, which is, if you think about our portfolio, we're really more diverse than most of the peers that we compete with. So, our approach to pricing is no unique in terms of just having one solution.  We have to be more precise in certain categories than really broad strokes across an entire portfolio. But I can say you our actions that we have taken in pricing have covered the majority of the portfolio and that actually has quite a bit of wide range of percentage increases, so it's hard to give you a specific answer.  Now, what I will tell you is that we have taken actions to mitigate those incremental inflations that we're seeing, that we feel comfortable at our approach, that we feel very good about how we are managing, and that we're going to continue to monitor things and take further actions if necessary. Thanks for the question, Jason.\nJason English: Thanks. But you don't know what your weighted average price increase is across your Portfolio?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: I mean, I think is something that for us it isn't something that we're going to be discussing and but happy to continue to have conversations about how we are responding in this moment and how we're feeling that very much a manageable solution from us.\nJason English: Okay. And one more thing just on the inflation, can you give us a quantification of what the rate was in the quarter and what you expect in the back half? I see the total for the year going from low-end to mid-singles to high-end. I'll just zoom in a little bit on the near term. Thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: Jason, an experience achieved that in that range. Jason, we need to remember also that in Q2, we have higher pressure on the meets commodity specialty in Bacon. I can tell you that in the first half of the year, our inflation rate was in the low-end of the mid-single-digit range including this Big 4 component. And that's the range that we saw for the quarter too.\nJason English: Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nPaulo Basilio: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carla Casella from JP Morgan. You may begin.\nCarla Casella: Hi. You mentioned that you're maintaining your leverage target below four times and you're currently at three. Would you ever think of changing that target to lower it or are you leaving that flexibility, just given your outlook for either the business or other potential, either M&A or shareholder-friendly activity?\nPaulo Basilio: We are. Thanks for the question. We are keeping. We are not changing that target of leverage to be below 4 times in a consistent way. Let's remember also that this 3.1 times that we closed that would go to 3.4 if we adjust by the EBITDA that we lost, that we're going to lose right at pro forma adjusted body EBITDA, of note that was the date that we divested.  But, yeah, our idea is to keep the same policy and to give us more flexibility to accelerate our strategy, and again, we're going to operate with this flexibility going forward.\nCarla Casella: Okay, great. Thank you.\nChris Jakubik: Maybe just one more question.\nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Robert Moskow (ph) from Credit Suisse. You may begin.\nRobert Moskow: Thanks for the question. Maybe a two-parter. One is, do you think that you will increase media again in 2022? And then the 2nd question is, I think you entered the year expecting market shares to grow.  So maybe you could decompose those 2 things as to which of those really drove the outperformance in 2021. And then also for your back half guidance, second quarter categories have been pretty resilient. Are you expecting a drop-off in category performance in 3rd and 4th, as people go back to work and consumers go back to school, specifically North American retail?\nMiguel Patricio: Let me -- let me answer the first part regarding marketing and media. And -- and I will pass the second one to Carlos to talk more specifically about categories in U.S. Let -- let me say that, first, we are excited about the changes that we have been making in our marketing programs and capabilities. We've been investing not only in our brands but also in our people.\nMiguel Patricio: This is an area that I'm very passionate about, and given the important state has to drive our growth. We are driving improvements actually in a couple of ways. The 1st one is more marketing dollars that we put. We have $100 million more in marketing than we had in 2019.  And we said that we want to increase marketing moving forward. So it's our intention. However, I think it's not only about increasing marketing, it's really about efficiencies. We're today achieving 30% more of our consumers with the same spend by doing better marketing, and not only better marketing, but also better media.  Third, I think we're excited about stepping up on creativity in our Company. Today, we started an internal agency in digital media in Canada in May last year and today, we have 12 of these internal hubs in different places covering more than 30 markets around the world.  And that is critical for marketing efficiency because it's faster, better, and much more creative. And we can really have marketing linked to the culture and need to be very fast on that. So, overall, that would be my answer for marketing. Carlos, you may answer the second one.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure. I can just build on your point, Miguel (ph). Specific to market share and our performance, I would say we are off to a very solid start to the year. And you saw in the presentation, we are seeing household penetration and repeat rate, growth rates, but higher than pre-pandemic levels. And we are regaining share and actually 58% of the business and is an improvement from last quarter,\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: and certainly from what we saw in 2019 pre-pandemic. When you take a step back and you look at our overall performance, I think what we are proving is that our consumer platform approach, our focus on renovation, innovation and marketing, and our resale activations, they're all working.  Now as we going forward, we will continue this agenda. We are going to increase support around key holidays while using price promotional [Indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, all the revenue management tools to manage inflation.  Now, for our total business and I think your point about asking about the future, there's several factors impacting the category performance, but I will tell you the most important is that we believe we're in a strong position to balance share, risk profitability to continue to deliver strong returns. Thanks for the question.\nPaulo Basilio: Just one comment on that, just to build on to what you're saying and the question here on the outlook. I think it's also relevant to say that while our outlook implies a lower EBITDA margin in the short-term, what is in the second half and Q3 and we don't think that EBITDA margin is representative of the run rate that they said, and we expect that to improve back to normal levels as we enter into 2022 and when our price realization starts to catch up in our results.\nRobert Moskow: I'm sorry, I want to press a little bit more. This is really a question about your categories. Like do you expect your categories to face pressure in third quarter and fourth quarter compared to the first half, because of people going more to work and because of students going back to school. What do you think will look more similar to second quarter?\nChris Jakubik: [Indiscernible]\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. Let me just give a perspective at least in the U.S. piece. I mentioned that there were several factors that is taking into consideration how the categories are behaving, and I think that there are 3 things in particular that we are looking at. There are certain things around the fact that there are hybrid working schedules.  We've to see the home purchases, and the renovations, and a new consumer preference that would actually likely to keep people at home, the higher level of home consumption that we have seen in the past.  We've also now seen the delta variant and the rising case counts across the U.S., and those are factors that we're also closely monitoring, and in particular, because they are important in terms of thinking about how families are preparing for the upcoming school year.  I think there are all things that are making it very difficult for us to say at this point is exactly how this is going to all going to shape out. What I can tell you is that we are focused on those things we can control.  So we are focused on making sure we improve our agility and execution as Miguel said, that we continue to invest behind our brands to build relevance and compete for those locations through our consumer platform-based approach, regardless of how we see this happening, and unfolding.  And so far we're pleased with how we are showing up. So we believe we can continue to see. And the fact that we are able to drive helps operates ratio repeat rates. And I mentioned earlier in the call, right now you see all channels growing, but realistically that is not right now our expectations as we go through the second half.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you for indulging me. Appreciate it.\nChris Jakubik: Great. Well, thanks to everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, Investor Relations and the media teams will be available for your follow-ups, but thanks everyone for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

We've been taking advantage of the scale that we have, and we've been building the agility that we need to build a better business for the future. We posted sustainable top line and bottom line gains versus \u201819, and we are encouraged because the strongest growth comes from priority platforms and markets what we call the growth platforms, taste elevation, and in emerging markets. And we continue seeing retail very strong, and we are coming back with food service. It's recovering and recovering fast. Transforming Kraft Heinz is what we all have in mind. And we want to do that, maintaining industry-leading profitability. We are investing more in our brands and better as well building a much more creative Company. We are also on track to deliver the $400 million of gross efficiencies in 2021 and effectively managing inflation. At the same time, we continued strengthening our portfolio and improving financial flexibility. We're adding capacity to our products to drive, grow, and energize platforms, and in the emerging markets.  We, as you know, closed the Nuts divestiture and we expect to close the Cheese divestiture in the second half of this year. Recently, we acquired Assan Foods in Turkey. It's a very small operation, but is a very important step into our strategy, because it accelerates taste elevation and is in emerging markets. And we continue to pay down debts and improve our net leverage. We continue to expect to have a very good 2021 actually to deliver a stronger 2021 than we projected when we provided our initial outlook in February, and that speaks to the strength and potential of our ongoing business. Thank you. We are now ready for your questions. And thank you for your question. Let me start and then maybe Carlos and Paulo can give you more color on that. As I mentioned on the call, we believe that inflation in our business remains manageable. And even with inflation, we expect to deliver, as I said, a stronger 2021 than we projected before. We continue to invest in our brands at the anticipated levels to drive our transformation, and we will continue to monitor things and take further action if of course is necessary, but Carlos, maybe you can give more color on it and maybe Paulo as well. Let me answer and then maybe Paulo, you can bring more precise numbers to Andrew. We are expecting 2022 to be better than the strategic plan that we presented to you. And why is that? I think our transformation is ahead of our plan. We've been beating our plans and our budgets, and we are optimistic and continue investing toward the future. I think it is still too early for us to be talking or to give you guidance about 2022. With all the volatility in the market, I think it's prudent not to go further on that. Let me -- let me answer the first part regarding marketing and media. And -- and I will pass the second one to Carlos to talk more specifically about categories in U.S. Let -- let me say that, first, we are excited about the changes that we have been making in our marketing programs and capabilities. We've been investing not only in our brands but also in our people. This is an area that I'm very passionate about, and given the important state has to drive our growth. We are driving improvements actually in a couple of ways. The 1st one is more marketing dollars that we put. We have $100 million more in marketing than we had in 2019.  And we said that we want to increase marketing moving forward. So it's our intention. However, I think it's not only about increasing marketing, it's really about efficiencies. We're today achieving 30% more of our consumers with the same spend by doing better marketing, and not only better marketing, but also better media.  Third, I think we're excited about stepping up on creativity in our Company. Today, we started an internal agency in digital media in Canada in May last year and today, we have 12 of these internal hubs in different places covering more than 30 markets around the world.  And that is critical for marketing efficiency because it's faster, better, and much more creative. And we can really have marketing linked to the culture and need to be very fast on that. So, overall, that would be my answer for marketing. Carlos, you may answer the second one."

            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Sure, Carlos. I think if you want to explain inflation and pricing from a total Company perspective, so break it down first on inflation. We're going to recall that in April we said that you're expecting inflation in the mid-single-digit range as a percent of COGS, but at the lower end of that range. Since April, our costs have continued to move higher. Now, we're expecting inflation still in the mid-single-digit range for the full year, but now slightly above the midpoint of the mid-single-digit range. Regarding pricing, as we are mentioning and Carlos has just said, we are using multiple revenue management levers including lease price actions to manage inflation, but I think it's important for us to keep in mind that we are going to be facing an unusually difficult pricing comparison in the second half of last year. Just to remind, just for context last year, second half our price was more than 4% higher than the prior year as we pulled back promotion to better protect customer service. In terms of the timing and the pricing realization, while we expect the timing of the cost inflation versus price realization to soften, our margin percentage to lower than the run rate levels in the short term, I think it's important to note that all of those impacts are already considered in the outlook that we have for the year. And again, as we mentioned in the beginning, we're still expecting \u2013 we are now expecting even stronger EBITDA dollars than we anticipated before. Good morning. Alexia, I can start here with this answer. I think yes, there are some adjustments to make in the gross margin. But when you think about year-over-year, I think we need to remember that we're going to be left \u2013 we were lapping in Q2 a big quarter last year with the all-pantry loading that happened in the quarter. Our overall margins of the business are very healthy in these Q2. I think in the second quarter, we were able to price, and we had enough pricing to offset, pricing plus our efficiencies were more than enough to offset our inflation that we had, but we work compared to a very heavy mix that we had in the last quarter. Going forward what is exactly, I think the key components that we are going to see in the back half is that we are going to start to have -- and that's already embedded in our outlook. We're going to start to have the restoration of some promotions that Carlos mentioned. Also, the mix impacts that we're going to see as the year go on. And also, this timing between pricing and pricing realization and inflation will impact our gross profit, but all those impacts are already inside the outlook that we disclosed. Andrew, just to complement here, I think as the year progresses,as Miguel mentioned, [indiscernible]late in the year, we will be providing more clarity about how we're seeing 2022. We're not discussing this today, but we can say that we see inflation as a consistent theme for us and the industry ahead of '22, and all those initiatives and actions that we are doing in terms of revenue management initiatives to manage the inflation, we're seeing based on expectations that inflation will continue into the next year. I think those initiatives together with our savings program, the $2 billion savings program will be sufficient that together with investments that we're making to improve the relevance of our brands. So again, we are very confident around our ability to manage the inflation and support the investments behind our turnaround as we are exiting '21 and entering '22. Thanks for the -- thanks for the comment. Again, we will discuss this internally and we will let you know. Welcome. Jason, an experience achieved that in that range. Jason, we need to remember also that in Q2, we have higher pressure on the meets commodity specialty in Bacon. I can tell you that in the first half of the year, our inflation rate was in the low-end of the mid-single-digit range including this Big 4 component. And that's the range that we saw for the quarter too. Welcome. We are. Thanks for the question. We are keeping. We are not changing that target of leverage to be below 4 times in a consistent way. Let's remember also that this 3.1 times that we closed that would go to 3.4 if we adjust by the EBITDA that we lost, that we're going to lose right at pro forma adjusted body EBITDA, of note that was the date that we divested.  But, yeah, our idea is to keep the same policy and to give us more flexibility to accelerate our strategy, and again, we're going to operate with this flexibility going forward. Just one comment on that, just to build on to what you're saying and the question here on the outlook. I think it's also relevant to say that while our outlook implies a lower EBITDA margin in the short-term, what is in the second half and Q3 and we don't think that EBITDA margin is representative of the run rate that they said, and we expect that to improve back to normal levels as we enter into 2022 and when our price realization starts to catch up in our results."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Sure Miguel. Thanks for the question. But first, I think I will say is in the U.S. we have said in the past is that we are proactively managing against the incremental inflation we see. And actually, we feel good about our ability to implement those actions when and where we see the need. So, if you look at inflation we saw in Q2, it is mainly coming from ingredients, things like soybeans, edible oils, packaging, and some transportation as well. And it is very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. And most recently, we also saw some increases too but driven by rising [ph] costs and some higher transportation rates. Now from a pricing perspective, as I mentioned on the call, we are restoring key promotional activations to drive the business versus the pandemic-induced pullbacks that we had in 2020. Now, as we have mentioned earlier in the year, our goal continues to be to connect with consumers that now have discovered or rediscovered our brands and drive the repeat rate among those households. So in that context and versus inflation, again we feel good about our ability to achieve the net pricing we need to offset inflation and maintain a strong household and repeat rate. Given that we are renovating our Portfolio to drive better value for consumers, improving the creative content of our marketing, and strengthening and diversifying our media impressions. What I will also add is that we're doing this primarily through four key revenue management initiatives. First, we are optimizing the frequency and depth of our promotion while we'll restore retail activation levels that I discussed in the call. Second, we're doing broad-based pricing actions, which we have announced across our Portfolio. Third, we're continuing to manage key commodity pricing. And lastly, we're using all other revenue management levers, including price pack architecture and managing category price ladders. If you look at our revenue management initiatives, they are guiding our smart trade investments so we can optimize returns on those investments and manage through the current inflationary environment. Now, in the near term, the timing of cost inflation versus price realization may lead to some degree of margin pressure, but this is reflected in an outlook, and we see net pricing and cost coming into balance as we exit the year. And then with that, let me pass it over to Paulo. Any other comments you want to add Paulo? Listen, first of all, thanks for the question. I think it's very fair. Let me start and then [Indiscernible] give a perspective on international. I think from an industry perspective, you're right. Channel trends are still normalizing.  But I have also to say too early to tell how the share of [Indiscernible] between away-from-home and at-home, ultimately, it's going to hold it out. Now recently, it does seem like the old channels are growing, but that's probably no likely to remain the case and that's not built into our expectations.  Now, in terms of our business, what we see is we are optimistic about our plans that we can actually drive sustainable growth in both the retail and the foodservice. And I think it's fair to say that we also have big ambition from the away-from-home business.  We believe food service is actually both a generation of insights and innovation that can actually help in the retail side of the business. And is also capable of driving outsized growth because we have actually put a reduced focus on culinary distribution and channel expansion.  And some of those channel trends, while still normalizing it's still a little bit early to say predicting exactly whether it's all going to happen now. But I do say that I do believe we're going to be stronger versus what we saw pre-pandemic, and essentially for two key reasons.  First, because our foodservice mix favors the QSR. And actually, that stands to recover and we are seeing that are already faster than the rest of the foodservice channel. And we also see that to be more resilient post-pandemic.  And frankly, early in the pandemic, we also made a strategic bet to support that growth in QSR and that bet is paying up. We now have 30% more capacity in our small package of ketchup and sauces, so that actually has been seen to be working.  And secondly, we see a more durable step-up in-home consumption that comes at the expense of other categories and brands without necessarily sacrificing food service recovery and growth. And then lastly, let me just give you a little more color on the away-from-home.  I mentioned that we gained a point of market share, food service recovery begins, and most of that actually was fueled by the actions we took in 3 areas that I mentioned, culinary distribution and new channels.  So in Q2, we actually executed 9 co-branded culinary limited-time offers with QSR partners. Now just one of those was actually so successful because it became part of our permanent menu item and now is going to be in '22.  And if you think about that context of the fact that we've been able to drive those kinds of limited time offers with QSR, in 2019 we had none of those. So, we are certainly driving a different level of execution with QSR.  Now, the second part of that, which is distribution, we actually grew key account by 20% over this Quarter. And then finally, as consumers continue to evolve how they cook and they eat and including the use of meal delivery kits, we're actually inserting our Kraft Heinz brands into that equation.  So, we are working with one popular direct-to-consumer Company to develop things like a recipe specifically for our Philadelphia Cream Cheese as the main ingredient of their products. And that actual product was ordered over 200,000 times by consumers are really an all-time record for that sales partner.  So when you look at it holistically, I feel very optimistic about our away-from-home business and that it actually is going to be a springboard for us to continue to drive retail growth. Now that's a perspective in the U.S. and Rafael (ph), do you want to add something in terms of the international business, how you see it. Well, let me just say, Jason, that let me give a little bit of more context, which is, if you think about our portfolio, we're really more diverse than most of the peers that we compete with. So, our approach to pricing is no unique in terms of just having one solution.  We have to be more precise in certain categories than really broad strokes across an entire portfolio. But I can say you our actions that we have taken in pricing have covered the majority of the portfolio and that actually has quite a bit of wide range of percentage increases, so it's hard to give you a specific answer.  Now, what I will tell you is that we have taken actions to mitigate those incremental inflations that we're seeing, that we feel comfortable at our approach, that we feel very good about how we are managing, and that we're going to continue to monitor things and take further actions if necessary. Thanks for the question, Jason. I mean, I think is something that for us it isn't something that we're going to be discussing and but happy to continue to have conversations about how we are responding in this moment and how we're feeling that very much a manageable solution from us. Sure. I can just build on your point, Miguel (ph). Specific to market share and our performance, I would say we are off to a very solid start to the year. And you saw in the presentation, we are seeing household penetration and repeat rate, growth rates, but higher than pre-pandemic levels. And we are regaining share and actually 58% of the business and is an improvement from last quarter, and certainly from what we saw in 2019 pre-pandemic. When you take a step back and you look at our overall performance, I think what we are proving is that our consumer platform approach, our focus on renovation, innovation and marketing, and our resale activations, they're all working.  Now as we going forward, we will continue this agenda. We are going to increase support around key holidays while using price promotional [Indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, all the revenue management tools to manage inflation.  Now, for our total business and I think your point about asking about the future, there's several factors impacting the category performance, but I will tell you the most important is that we believe we're in a strong position to balance share, risk profitability to continue to deliver strong returns. Thanks for the question. Yeah. Let me just give a perspective at least in the U.S. piece. I mentioned that there were several factors that is taking into consideration how the categories are behaving, and I think that there are 3 things in particular that we are looking at. There are certain things around the fact that there are hybrid working schedules.  We've to see the home purchases, and the renovations, and a new consumer preference that would actually likely to keep people at home, the higher level of home consumption that we have seen in the past.  We've also now seen the delta variant and the rising case counts across the U.S., and those are factors that we're also closely monitoring, and in particular, because they are important in terms of thinking about how families are preparing for the upcoming school year.  I think there are all things that are making it very difficult for us to say at this point is exactly how this is going to all going to shape out. What I can tell you is that we are focused on those things we can control.  So we are focused on making sure we improve our agility and execution as Miguel said, that we continue to invest behind our brands to build relevance and compete for those locations through our consumer platform-based approach, regardless of how we see this happening, and unfolding.  And so far we're pleased with how we are showing up. So we believe we can continue to see. And the fact that we are able to drive helps operates ratio repeat rates. And I mentioned earlier in the call, right now you see all channels growing, but realistically that is not right now our expectations as we go through the second half."

            "name": "Rafael Oliveira",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Carlos. And hi, Bryan (ph). Look, on balance, our developed markets are experiencing very similar trends to retail and food service in U.S. and Canada. Emerging markets on the other hand, and foodservice has actually rebounded stronger than in developed markets.  Then in most countries that either had shorter or even stricter lockdowns, that kept their economies open during the pandemic overall. So I mean, the consumption obviously differs country by country, in-home, and out-of-home.  The best of the pandemic lockdown approached vaccine availability changes a lot. And given the delta variant now it's a bit early to tell how the channels -- where the channels will stabilize in the second half.  But all that said, we're seeing a lot of improvements on the retail channels and giving us a lot of confidence that we will come out of the pandemic well-positioned right after the pandemic. On the foodservice side, our mix is even more weighted towards QSR than the U.S. is and this format is recovering very quickly.  So with distribution gains in emerging markets and the potential of the foodservice that we still have across our overall international, I'm still quite optimistic that after the pandemic hence, the net will be quite positive."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations for The Kraft Heinz Company. Please go ahead, sir.\nChristopher Jakubik: Thank you and hello everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2021 business update. As you know, during our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties and these are discussed in our press release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio for a few quick opening remarks. Miguel?\nMiguel Patricio: Yeah. Well, thank you Chris. I just wanted to start our discussion today with a few overall thoughts. First, that we have had a very, very encouraging start of the year, both topline and bottom line with our strongest growth in priority platforms and markets, especially in under-developed countries with a very strong result. We were able to hold household penetration gains even as markets begin to open and effectively managing inflation and supply constraints. We are also very encouraged by our progress with the initiatives to accelerate our advantage in different areas like in marketing, be more agile and more creative in retail and foodservice joint business plans, in unlocking capacity in Grow and Energize platforms. And also on bringing efficiencies - growth efficiency gains that we continue tracking to be about $400 million in the year. That said we feel that it's still too early to change our outlook for the full year. We could expect 2021 financials to be ahead of our strategic plan and we are expecting mid single-digit growth in Q2 2021 versus the same period in '19. At the same time, we should see stronger but manageable inflation beginning in Q2. Finally, we are pleased with additional financial flexibility that we are building. We continue to aggressively reduce debt and our divestures are on track to further increased flexibility. I will now hand it back to the operator and we can start the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Miguel, I know that organic sales growth guidance for 2Q is a bit better than what consensus was expecting. But it does represent a notable sequential deceleration versus 2019. And I'm trying to get a sense of, is this - I assume this is primarily just, a, 1Q was quite a bit stronger than you probably thought and maybe you're also trying to be thinking through and being prudent about what further sort of reopening and mobility means for sales trends going forward. And then I was hoping maybe Rafael could you comment even briefly just how you see the durability of the emerging market strength that we saw in the quarter? Thank you. Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Hi, Andrew. Thank you for the question. Now keep in mind that in the second quarter we are going to have a different mix. Foodservice will be stronger and for sure with opening of the market because of COVID fading the mix will change and so that is one of the reasons. The second reason also let's remember that McCafe that was in the numbers of '19 and that is not in the numbers of '21 and that has a strong impact. I don't know if Paulo, you want to complement that question before passing to Rafael?\nPaulo Basilio: Miguel, thank you. I'll highlight the right points. We are calling down versus prior year low single digit growth and the impact of McCafe is always 1.1 percentage points. So it's not that dramatic of deceleration although as you are saying that we are seeing the reopening of the developed markets and there is some mix impacts that we're going to feel in the quarter.\nMiguel Patricio: But that said, yes, first quarter was a very strong quarter as you mentioned in terms of net sales when compared with '19. Rafael, please?\nRafael Oliveira: Yes. Hi, Andrew. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I mean for us emerging markets consumption has held up relatively well during the pandemic, and I would say 2Q reasons. One is availability. I mean our customer servicing across international has been quite consistent during the whole pandemic. But also like the focus, right, second is the focus. We remain very focused on our emerging market strategy, I mean centered around Taste Elevation platform, right, and combined with localized \u2014 the proven go-to-market expansion model. And this has been performing quite well. There are two factors that - these two factors helped us during the pandemic, right, and you can see on the results, it added a point of share. We've been gaining share also during the last three quarters in a row. So we do expect this momentum to continue as we move throughout the year and based on the strong initiatives that we discussed during CAGNY.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you look at your U.S. retail mix as maybe more exposed than some of your peers to kids going back to school. You have Mac and Cheese there, you have Kraft Singles, Oscar Mayer Lunch Meats and that's a lot of, I guess, parents making lunches for their kids when they're at home. When they're going back to full time schooling, do you think that these brands will face more than normal headwinds or does it somehow kind of - is it - does it make up for itself somewhere along the way? Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, first of all, thank you for the question. Listen, we feel good about controlling the controllables. I mean, and if you think about the gains we have made in household penetration. Those are coming from younger more diverse families and we're seeing that those families are actually increasing the consumption across different day-parts and that's happening whether it's Mac and Cheese, whether that's Oscar Mayer hot dogs, very consistent. Plus even if you think about brands that typically - kids use at school like a lunch box, we're actually also seeing gains on those even over the last six months. So what I would say is our focus on continue to retain those new households regardless of the circumstances is working and it will be the things that we'll continue to do moving forward. Thanks.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I've got two questions related to inflation. The first one, I think the guidance is for mid single-digit cost inflation. And just wanted to get an understanding there of is that gross inflation or is that net of cost savings and if not, just if you can give us a breakdown between the gross inflation versus net inflation?\nMiguel Patricio: Bryan thanks for the question. So, the guidance that we provided in mid single-digit is growth, so it's a percentage of our total COGS as gross inflation, okay? Actually we are seeing that it would be - currently in the low end of the mid-single digit range and that's our view. And when we see this happening today as we mentioned before, we also saw as many peers, the escalation of this inflation since our last call but when we add, as we mentioned our cost efficiencies that we highlighted around that we still seeing like $400 million in efficiencies in our supply chain. And all the levers that we have for revenue management we believe that the final number will be manageable for the company.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you. And then if I could follow-up Rafael, just for you \u2014 just in terms of inflation, could you just give us a little bit of perspective on what tools you have available, especially in developing markets, but also in Europe in terms of managing inflation? So is it different I guess in terms of the way that you'll work through inflation in your markets than what we'll see in North America?\nRafael Oliveira: Yes. Hi, Bryan. Yes, look, so let me break down the two. In emerging markets, I mean, in general acceptance of pricing is better, right, because inflations are more normal on the local economies. In developed markets, I mean what I can tell you is we've already successfully closed negotiations with all our key retail partners and especially in key countries like France, Germany and we remain to achieve the pricing and premiumization behind the brands that we needed. So we feel quite confident about that. I mean, in terms of comparison, you said comparing to the US, I mean there are similar and differences, right, like similar to North America, the costs have moved against us in ingredients, in packaging, but different in North America overall, logistics is not a major contributor to inflation in international. So in terms of numbers is what in line with what Paulo said comparable to mid single-digit range for the total.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies.\nRob Dickerson: Great, thank you so much. Miguel, I just had a question around your innovation plans, marketing plans kind of vis-a-vis SKU rationalization, right. So as we heard for over a year, right, there has been a lot of optimization for the retailers to kind of focus on those core SKUs, right, to just essentially maximize the benefits of velocity and scale, which you also speak to all the time. So I'm just curious as you kind of look forward kind of around that creative development of the innovation, are there sizable pieces of the portfolio that you kind of foresee rationalizing such that those tails come off, new innovation comes in, but still focused on the core on those high [ph] velocity items? Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: Let me answer your question and I ask Carlos to complement my thoughts. We see this as a great - we have seen and this is a great opportunity for us to - exactly to focus on SKUs with higher rotation and also from a supply standpoint to improve efficiencies in our factories and also on costs. So we see this move as a very positive. Carlos, do you want to comment more precisely in terms of numbers of what's going on for us?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure Miguel. What I would say is a lot of it - we have done [Technical Difficulty]. So if you go \u2014 as we go into this year, we have reduced probably 20% of our SKUs versus what we had in '19. And I think this has been done to duration [ph] with our retail partners. So we're building together kind of level of trust and transparency to make sure that we impact, focus on our core but drive better velocity and actually allows us to have - to better service with our customers. So overall, I feel good about where we are and the progress we have made in this area. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me okay?\nMiguel Patricio: Yes.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. So I wanted to ask about the promotional path from here. You talked, I think in the prepared remarks about pulling back on promotions in January and February during Q1. Does that mean that we're likely to see a more elevated level of promotion year-on-year given the pullback that happened last year? And what does that mean for net pricing over the next couple of quarters? Thank you and I'll pass it on.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: I can start. Let me at least give you a perspective to first of all about the overall view of how we're thinking about our pricing and how that fits in terms of our promotions. I can tell you is, I feel good about our ability to pass through our cost inflation and as we see it and where we need to do it.\nMiguel Patricio: We lost Carlos. So let me just pick up on that. I think Carlos froze out a little bit, Alexia. So we're going to come back, but I think where Carlos was going is in terms of the - what we're seeing going on in the marketplace and what we see unfolding is in Q1 we were able to sort of build further on, sorry, Carlos why don't you go ahead. He froze out at the start there.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sorry, my apologies. Hopefully you can hear me okay now?\nAlexia Howard: Sounds great.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Okay. Listen, this is the new world that we're still working through. So I appreciate the people patience. What I was getting at is \u2014 within the context of our pricing that we're looking at do know that in the, if you think about our quarters, seven of the last eight quarters, we actually were able to actually drive pricing as a positive contribution to our net sales. So we are seeing that our iconic brands are actually showing the pricing power. Now, when you look going forward, we will return to supporting key promotional window. So if you think about coming up Memorial Day, we also are going to be making sure that we show up in those moments. At the same time, we will implement the revenue management initiatives to drive share growth and improve the returns. And if I sit back and I try to summarize kind of how that we're thinking through this, the way I think of it is this three-prong approach. One, making sure we continue to renovate our portfolio to drive better value for our consumers that we improve the creative content of our marketing and that we strengthened and diversifying our media impressions. So all said, I feel good about our ability to deal with the inflation that we have and making sure we do this in a way that is positive for the company.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in. to put a finer point on Alexia's question, do you expect pricing, net of everything to be positive in the U.S. in the back half of the year?\nPaulo Basilio: Hi, Jason. Listen, as a matter of practice, we do not forecast pricing. But as we - and again, we are seeing that we're going to have - we're going to be up in the second half against some unusual comparisons in the back half. But as Carlos mentioned, we see a lot of levers for us to manage inflation through revenue management, through savings. So we're feeling pretty very good about where - how to manage our profitability that's coming from this inflation impact.\nJason English: Maybe to help us get a little more comfort on that let's flip to the cost side. I know you said sort of low end to mid singles plus $400 million of cost saves, I mean, that's - like a 2% sort of net inflation, I think. You can tell me if I'm wrong on that, but what does the cadence look like as we go through the year? I'm guessing given the move to some of these costs, your exit rate in the back half of this year is going to be substantially above that. And if I'm off base on that please correct me.\nPaulo Basilio: We have a ramp up of gross inflation as the year progresses. But we also have a ramp up of our sales initiatives going on as the year progresses. And on top of that, we would have our - also our revenue management initiatives so again, I'm not going to give exactly quarterly number levels here, but that's how you should think about the progression of our base, our cost base.\nJason English: Okay, thank you.\nPaulo Basilio: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I'm going to start beating on the debt inflation horse here. I know we're talking about it a lot but I just wanted to get a sense of how locked in you are on your raw materials for the rest of the year? I guess, putting in another way, is it fair to assume unless there's some big spikes in items that are harder to buy ahead - mid single-digit inflation is fairly safe to build in. I'm just trying to think if items like cheese and meat and coffee rise a bit higher - these are items that historically Kraft has locked in many months in advance at time. So I just wanted to get a sense of the risk either up or down to that - the guidance of mid single-digit inflation.\nPaulo Basilio: Hi, Ken. This varies. And again, we have specifically in our Big 4 \u2014 our key Big 4 commodities for the full year, we are seeing just a slight inflation, okay? We are going to have our heaviest comp in Q2 that you're going to be lapping a very low price in cheese last year in a high price of pork bellies this year. But overall, in terms of the Big 4 we are seeing a slight inflation. In terms of how we manage and hedge, it varies by type of areas. So there are some commodities that we go longer, beyond six months, nine months, there are other that are shorter, but this varies a lot. But what I can tell is overall when we see the scenarios of course there is a lot of volatility in these markets. But overall when we see where the commodities start today \u2014 the range of mid single-digit is what we're seeing. And again, as I said, we are seeing as overall as a percent of COGS in the low-end of this range.\nKen Goldman: Very quick follow-up, what are your experts telling you about how valid some of these prices we're seeing for corn and soybeans and meat given supply and demand? I guess I'm asking is there is a little bit of froth created by traders in the market right now.\nPaulo Basilio: Ken I would not like to enter in this type of forecast. We are more focused on to be sure that we manage our cost for different levels of price and if we provide to our business specific hedging profile that allow the business to plan itself.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim.\nLaurent Grandet: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in. So two questions, one on Canada. So Canada is definitely improving. So, could you please give us a bit more color about what's going on there and how sustainable and the gross and the rebound it is for the next few months and quarters?\nMiguel Patricio: Well, let me answer that question. I think you are absolutely right. Canada is definitely improving, had a very good quarter. I think that we did much better job in terms of promotional calendar for Canada that last year we started with big promotions and that the ROI was not exactly - it was great. And we are being much more disciplined on our promotions and that's what it reflects, so there was a big increase in margin from 16% last year to about 22% this year. But it is not only on margin that Canada is improving. I'm very satisfied with the way that we are evolving on innovation pipeline, with marketing and creativity and digital marketing. I think we are having a very different Canada than we had just one - a year and a half ago.\nLaurent Grandet: Thanks. And maybe a broader question on your straight [ph] brands so compared to [indiscernible] you laid down on that last year and now we are six, eight months within the implementation of that plan. So could you maybe tell us what you think - you've been very successful in implementing and you're ahead of what you expected and maybe some space or some strategic initiatives where you think you are sitting behind and why?\nMiguel Patricio: I would say that, overall, we are very excited with our transformation plan. And it's deep and it's in all areas. We are all evolving and after one year, I would say that we are going in a much more accelerated rate than we could imagine and especially in a year that we are doing all this through Zoom meetings, working from home. So it surprised us velocity, the agility that we are having in all areas, in all areas from supply to marketing to finance to all areas of the company. But this is a journey. Using an analogy of baseball, I would say that we finished the first inning. We are now going to the second inning. But there is still a big game ahead of us to play, but we are excited about the possibility, the evolution.\nLaurent Grandet: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on and [indiscernible] plan. Good work. Thanks.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yeah, hey, thanks. And maybe to build on that last question a bit. I think it's been a little while since we spoke in detail about employee engagement and morale at Kraft Heinz. And to some extent also about retailer engagement - Miguel you did speak to helping improve customer satisfaction in the prepared remarks. I guess as you step back and think about the journey over the past year and the progress made since 2019, can you update us on how you perceive your current standing against those teams today and how that feeds into your outlook as you go forward into '21 and beyond?\nMiguel Patricio: Sure. I will comment on our employee engagement. I will ask Carlos to talk about customer satisfaction engagement specifically in U.S. We have great progress on that part as well. I would say that among everything \u2014 all things that we have been doing maybe employee engagement is where we have the biggest shift with our people much more engaged. And when I say this, this is of course is from quantitative research, but also qualitatively. So, our team is much more engaged working in a much more cooperative way. We've been eliminating silos that we had in the company and this year of this pandemic was - we were already organized in a different way and we had to be much, much faster in that way. I would say that morale is much higher. We have a much more engaged team. They understand the strategy we have ahead and they are excited about the journey that they are leaving. That being said, again, we still have a room for improvement and we'll continue working in that sense. Carlos, maybe you can comment on the customer side?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure, Miguel. Thank you. And I can testify to what Miguel is saying that we have seen that across entire company. The level of engagement, the way that the teams are working with an agile mindset we do. Related to our customers what I can tell you is we are now in a much different place than we were a year ago. We have now been able to build trust with our key retailers. We are working in a part that includes a level of transparency, that we hadn't seen in the past and in fact our retailers are also - and partners are recognizing that. So I think that now when we hear from them directly that it feels like a new Kraft Heinz. We take that we've tried because it's - because of the work that we have now - and the collaborations we know we're doing with them in a way that we hadn't done in the past. So something for us to continue to build on, but thanks for the question.\nSteve Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, I would currently would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Jakubik.\nChristopher Jakubik: Thank you and thanks everybody for joining us today. For analysts that have follow-up questions Andy Larkin and myself will be available to take them. And for the media Michael Mullen will be available for your calls. So again, thanks everybody for joining us today and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Yeah. Well, thank you Chris. I just wanted to start our discussion today with a few overall thoughts. First, that we have had a very, very encouraging start of the year, both topline and bottom line with our strongest growth in priority platforms and markets, especially in under-developed countries with a very strong result. We were able to hold household penetration gains even as markets begin to open and effectively managing inflation and supply constraints. We are also very encouraged by our progress with the initiatives to accelerate our advantage in different areas like in marketing, be more agile and more creative in retail and foodservice joint business plans, in unlocking capacity in Grow and Energize platforms. And also on bringing efficiencies - growth efficiency gains that we continue tracking to be about $400 million in the year. That said we feel that it's still too early to change our outlook for the full year. We could expect 2021 financials to be ahead of our strategic plan and we are expecting mid single-digit growth in Q2 2021 versus the same period in '19. At the same time, we should see stronger but manageable inflation beginning in Q2. Finally, we are pleased with additional financial flexibility that we are building. We continue to aggressively reduce debt and our divestures are on track to further increased flexibility. I will now hand it back to the operator and we can start the Q&A. Hi, Andrew. Thank you for the question. Now keep in mind that in the second quarter we are going to have a different mix. Foodservice will be stronger and for sure with opening of the market because of COVID fading the mix will change and so that is one of the reasons. The second reason also let's remember that McCafe that was in the numbers of '19 and that is not in the numbers of '21 and that has a strong impact. I don't know if Paulo, you want to complement that question before passing to Rafael? But that said, yes, first quarter was a very strong quarter as you mentioned in terms of net sales when compared with '19. Rafael, please? Well, first of all, thank you for the question. Listen, we feel good about controlling the controllables. I mean, and if you think about the gains we have made in household penetration. Those are coming from younger more diverse families and we're seeing that those families are actually increasing the consumption across different day-parts and that's happening whether it's Mac and Cheese, whether that's Oscar Mayer hot dogs, very consistent. Plus even if you think about brands that typically - kids use at school like a lunch box, we're actually also seeing gains on those even over the last six months. So what I would say is our focus on continue to retain those new households regardless of the circumstances is working and it will be the things that we'll continue to do moving forward. Thanks. Bryan thanks for the question. So, the guidance that we provided in mid single-digit is growth, so it's a percentage of our total COGS as gross inflation, okay? Actually we are seeing that it would be - currently in the low end of the mid-single digit range and that's our view. And when we see this happening today as we mentioned before, we also saw as many peers, the escalation of this inflation since our last call but when we add, as we mentioned our cost efficiencies that we highlighted around that we still seeing like $400 million in efficiencies in our supply chain. And all the levers that we have for revenue management we believe that the final number will be manageable for the company. Let me answer your question and I ask Carlos to complement my thoughts. We see this as a great - we have seen and this is a great opportunity for us to - exactly to focus on SKUs with higher rotation and also from a supply standpoint to improve efficiencies in our factories and also on costs. So we see this move as a very positive. Carlos, do you want to comment more precisely in terms of numbers of what's going on for us? Yes. We lost Carlos. So let me just pick up on that. I think Carlos froze out a little bit, Alexia. So we're going to come back, but I think where Carlos was going is in terms of the - what we're seeing going on in the marketplace and what we see unfolding is in Q1 we were able to sort of build further on, sorry, Carlos why don't you go ahead. He froze out at the start there. Well, let me answer that question. I think you are absolutely right. Canada is definitely improving, had a very good quarter. I think that we did much better job in terms of promotional calendar for Canada that last year we started with big promotions and that the ROI was not exactly - it was great. And we are being much more disciplined on our promotions and that's what it reflects, so there was a big increase in margin from 16% last year to about 22% this year. But it is not only on margin that Canada is improving. I'm very satisfied with the way that we are evolving on innovation pipeline, with marketing and creativity and digital marketing. I think we are having a very different Canada than we had just one - a year and a half ago. I would say that, overall, we are very excited with our transformation plan. And it's deep and it's in all areas. We are all evolving and after one year, I would say that we are going in a much more accelerated rate than we could imagine and especially in a year that we are doing all this through Zoom meetings, working from home. So it surprised us velocity, the agility that we are having in all areas, in all areas from supply to marketing to finance to all areas of the company. But this is a journey. Using an analogy of baseball, I would say that we finished the first inning. We are now going to the second inning. But there is still a big game ahead of us to play, but we are excited about the possibility, the evolution. Thank you. Sure. I will comment on our employee engagement. I will ask Carlos to talk about customer satisfaction engagement specifically in U.S. We have great progress on that part as well. I would say that among everything \u2014 all things that we have been doing maybe employee engagement is where we have the biggest shift with our people much more engaged.

            "name": "Rafael Oliveira",
            "content": "Yes. Hi, Andrew. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I mean for us emerging markets consumption has held up relatively well during the pandemic, and I would say 2Q reasons. One is availability. I mean our customer servicing across international has been quite consistent during the whole pandemic. But also like the focus, right, second is the focus. We remain very focused on our emerging market strategy, I mean centered around Taste Elevation platform, right, and combined with localized \u2014 the proven go-to-market expansion model. And this has been performing quite well. There are two factors that - these two factors helped us during the pandemic, right, and you can see on the results, it added a point of share. We've been gaining share also during the last three quarters in a row. So we do expect this momentum to continue as we move throughout the year and based on the strong initiatives that we discussed during CAGNY. Yes. Hi, Bryan. Yes, look, so let me break down the two. In emerging markets, I mean, in general acceptance of pricing is better, right, because inflations are more normal on the local economies. In developed markets, I mean what I can tell you is we've already successfully closed negotiations with all our key retail partners and especially in key countries like France, Germany and we remain to achieve the pricing and premiumization behind the brands that we needed. So we feel quite confident about that. I mean, in terms of comparison, you said comparing to the US, I mean there are similar and differences, right, like similar to North America, the costs have moved against us in ingredients, in packaging, but different in North America overall, logistics is not a major contributor to inflation in international. So in terms of numbers is what in line with what Paulo said comparable to mid single-digit range for the total."

            "content": "Miguel, I know that organic sales growth guidance for 2Q is a bit better than what consensus was expecting. But it does represent a notable sequential deceleration versus 2019. And I'm trying to get a sense of, is this - I assume this is primarily just, a, 1Q was quite a bit stronger than you probably thought and maybe you're also trying to be thinking through and being prudent about what further sort of reopening and mobility means for sales trends going forward. And then I was hoping maybe Rafael could you comment even briefly just how you see the durability of the emerging market strength that we saw in the quarter? Thank you. Thank you. Great. Thanks very much."

            "name": "Paulo Basilio",
            "content": "Miguel, thank you. I'll highlight the right points. We are calling down versus prior year low single digit growth and the impact of McCafe is always 1.1 percentage points. So it's not that dramatic of deceleration although as you are saying that we are seeing the reopening of the developed markets and there is some mix impacts that we're going to feel in the quarter. Hi, Jason. Listen, as a matter of practice, we do not forecast pricing. But as we - and again, we are seeing that we're going to have - we're going to be up in the second half against some unusual comparisons in the back half.

So if you go \u2014 as we go into this year, we have reduced probably 20% of our SKUs versus what we had in '19. And I think this has been done to duration [ph] with our retail partners. So we're building together kind of level of trust and transparency to make sure that we impact, focus on our core but drive better velocity and actually allows us to have - to better service with our customers. So overall, I feel good about where we are and the progress we have made in this area. Thanks. I can start. Let me at least give you a perspective to first of all about the overall view of how we're thinking about our pricing and how that fits in terms of our promotions. I can tell you is, I feel good about our ability to pass through our cost inflation and as we see it and where we need to do it. Sorry, my apologies. Hopefully you can hear me okay now? Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela. Please go ahead.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at The Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our fourth quarter 2022 business update. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News & Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I'm now going to hand it over to CEO, Miguel Patricio, for some brief opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. Let me first take a moment to say, how proud I am of Kraft Heinz team. We have come so far on our transformation journey. It's quite amazing. And the fourth quarter was no exception. You can see the momentum building across our business, service levels and market share trends are improving. Base volumes are positive. We are outpacing the competition in foodservice and emerging markets and by a lot. And importantly, we continue to invest for growth. Once again, we have unlocked efficiencies over $400 million this year, and this allow us to invest in new tools and capabilities for our teams, a new product innovation for our consumers.  From a pricing perspective, 99% of all needed pricing has already been announced for 2023. As we look to the rest of the year, we have no current plan to announce new pricing in North America, Europe, Latin America and most of Asia. I am very optimistic. I'm very excited about how we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. With that, I\u2019ll ask Andre, Carlos and Rafael to join me. So let's open the call for the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. \nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Your EBITDA guidance for fiscal '23 excluding the impact from the 53rd week is actually in line with your long term algorithm. And when you detailed this, I guess at CAGNY a year ago, you sort of I think said it would take multiple years to reach this level of growth. So I guess in this regard, I'm trying to get a sense of whether -- if I have this right, whether you are ahead of schedule? And if so, what you attribute it to? Like, what's gone better or faster maybe than you anticipated? And I guess most importantly, are you in a place where you see this level of growth now as more sustainable? Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Andrew, for the question. Andre, could you answer this question?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. Hi, Andrew. Good morning again. And thanks for the question and thanks a lot for noticing it. In fact, we feel very proud about what we have been achieving as a company. And I think in 2023, we will mark another step-up in our performance. And as we all notice, we are on the long-term algorithm already on net sales and also on EBITDA, if we remove the effects from currency and from the 53rd week. And I think this is the best way to show that transformation is working through results, right? And it's good to see how 2022 that we finished in very strong momentum, how that's translating into a stronger performance in 2023. This is a consequence of our market share in the U.S. continuing to improve. Still negative but improving, as foodservice continues to deliver at high at above 30%, emerging markets growing double-digits in a strong rate. So all these, in terms of growth, are working in our favor.  Supply chain efficiencies continue to happen. And in 2023, as you might have noticed in guidance, we are expanding gross margin and see our path to go back to 2019 levels, which is allowing us to continue to increase the investment in the business for growth. So we are in 2023 increasing investments behind marketing, technology and people, which are critical levers for us to fuel the growth of the company. So we feel good about, where we are moving. We still want to do, but we will.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. My question is about just the free cash flow, and I have a couple of questions related to that. I guess the first is just simply, Andre, can you give us a little bit more insight in terms of, I guess, the inventory build? Is it finished goods inventory? Is it raw materials, the decision to do that? And I guess, in the prepared remarks, it's tied to service level. So are you going to need to carry elevated inventories through '23? Is my first question.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, as we said, as you have seen throughout 2022, we had to rebuild inventory. Our case fill rate at the end of '21 was in the low 80s, which is extremely low. So we had a lot of recovery to do. So you have seen throughout the year, the effect of us build inventory. Keep in mind that we finished 2022 is still in the low 90s. So it's still not what retailers are expecting it should be and what we expect ourselves should be.  Being said that, we do have, compared to historical levels, higher inventory coverage in average in raw and package materials, also, which is normal because we're also trying to build the buffers given all the volatility and uncertainty. So we expect that those raw and package materials should decline over time, including starting in 2023. And in finished goods, even though we need to increase inventory in certain spots where the inventory service levels are still low, we still have a lot of opportunity to rebalance our inventory across the network. I think one of the consequences of the pandemic, the demand volatility is that we started to have inventory straight in the wrong warehouses to meet the demand. And that takes time to sort itself out, right, because of actual cost of product and shipping items across the network. So because of these effects and all the investments that we have made in the past two years to automate demand forecast, we are investing a lot of resources in better supply planning. We are -- we have a big project starting -- that already started to network simplification. So the combination of these investments, plus the rebalance of the network, plus we going back to the more historical levels of averaging raw and package materials should start to system recovering inventory starting '23, but -- or into the future.\nBryan Spillane : So I guess this was kind of bridging that now to maybe how we should be thinking about free cash flow and free cash flow conversion for '23. Can you give us a little bit of perspective on, I guess, capital spending? Will inventory or working capital be a tailwind? Like can we get back to more normal free cash flow conversion in '23? Or is it still going to be somewhat, I guess, subdued relative to previous years?\nAndre Maciel : So free cash flow will be better than 2022. We were still not going to be in the long-term algorithm of 100%, and that's in great part because of CapEx investments. As we have said as well during -- when we unveiled the long-term algorithm, we are investing for growth. And we have stepped up investment in CapEx. You have seen in 2022, we are spending a little more than $900 million, which is a big increase versus $700 million, $750 million that were in the past. We are ramping up this again in 2023 and 2024 as part of our long-term plan. And then we should go back down to closer to 3.5% of net sales starting 2025. That's the current perspective. So when the CapEx starts to come down, that will help us to give the step-up change to go back to achieve the 100% as we said the long-term outlook. So this year, I mean -- if you want to expect something this year, it should be like about 80% or so is going to have addressable back in line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChris Growe: I just had a question for you in relation to promotional spending. And you had some data and some charts that showed it was down since 2019 and down more than your branded competition. I just want to get a sense of -- do you expect to increase that? Is that kind of tied to service levels as those improved throughout the year? And then also to better understand what's the appropriate bogey for that level of rebuilding promotional spending? So what portion of that 5% decline you show in 2019 should rebuild? You've got some good data and capabilities now. Can you be more efficient with promotional spending? I think the answer is yes, but just want to get a little more color on that.\nMiguel Patricio : Maybe, Andre, you can start and then Carlos comment specifically in U.S.\nAndre Maciel : Yes. So -- and thanks for the question. We have increased trade investment in a very significant way from 2017 to '19, more than $1 billion in the United States alone. So we have restarted from a very high base. We increased late 2019. We created a centralized revenue management organization. We have more than 50 people fully dedicated to that in North America alone, and we have started to gathering power of our sales organization. We put a lot of discipline and science behind making promotional decisions in a way that benefits us and retailers. And you have seen a lot of that coming to fruition now in the results of the last three years. That is obviously an impact from service level as well. But just to put in perspective, if you look at Q4 volume sold on promotion, we had about 24% of volume sold on promotion in Q4 '22. That's higher than 2021, but above 23% as a 2 percentage point in the past, still lower than the branded competitors in our categories. But in 2019, it was 34%. So that's too much. And if you look at where we are right now in terms of promotional investments, we still have a significant amount of promotions that have negative ROIs. So it's not about cutting promotions, it's about deploying it in a smarter way. So we are in the journey, and we have seen the results from that, but there's still a lot of opportunities for us to go ahead. We will deploy it, and want it step-increasing. It is not for me to give you a precise number of where this is going to land. But what I can tell you with confidence is that we're not going to get anywhere close to 2019 levels.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : Yes. Let me -- it's Carlos here, Chris. Listen, what I would say is just building on some of the comments that Andre just mentioned is that as we think about promotional activity going forward, it really is about being surgical about how we invest those promotion dollars. Thinking through making them around event-based activity. So that way, we are thinking through how do we make sure that we are driving the best utilization of that particular event versus a price-based activity. And I think what happens then is it allows us to actually make sure we are focused in terms of driving positive ROIs. And I think if you -- as you heard from Andre, we have made a huge thrive from where we went to 2019, and we're not going back. In fact, when you look at some of our focus on improving the ROI of our programs, today, on average, if you think of 2022 versus 2019, we've actually tripled the level of ROI returns of our promotions from three years ago. So again, it is a signal that all the investments we're doing in terms of revenue management are agile still work in terms of better understanding how to read the data and how to utilize our funding is actually driving specifically better ROI in every funding that we're doing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cody Ross with UBS. \nCody Ross: Just a quick question around your organic sales guidance. You guided 2023 organic sales growth of 4% to 6%. Based on wraparound pricing from 2022 and the incremental price that you discussed for 2023, we estimate that your volume growth assumption is flat to down low single digits. Is that correct? And then if so, what gives you the confidence that elasticity will remain so low as we move throughout the year?\nMiguel Patricio : Andre?\nAndre Maciel : Yes. Hi, Cody, thanks for the question. So as well noted, we are finishing Q4 growing about 10%. And we just have a new round of price that we just implemented. So that certainly has a positive effect in the first half of the year. We expect gradually throughout the year for us to be -- as we circulate the price increases from last year that we end up landing in the second half on something closer to our long-term growth algorithm, okay? Being said that, the growth in 2023 is all driven by price. So volume is still negative. Obviously, it improves throughout the quarters as we start to lap the prices. But even at the end of the year, will still be negative. That's something that as we think about the future, it's not the negative balance that we want. We want a good balance as we think about top line growth between price and volume. And we're going to talk a lot about that the next week in CAGNY. We have contemplated the guidance and increased level of elasticity compared to what we saw in 2022, but still not the way up to the historical levels.  In terms of what gives confidence. So you saw the sell-out for the industry to our Q4 was still very strong. In fact, if you look at sell-out elastic, just looking at price and volume based on the sell-out, Q4 was better than any other quarter in the year. Now we obviously need to -- we need to keep actively monitoring and we are because throughout this year, we can see maybe consumers will change the behavior. Carlos, do you want to comment something on that?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : The one thing I would add there, Cody, is the fact that we also are making sure that we continue to expand in terms of -- in the number of formats and price points that we offer within our categories to make sure we maintain the consumers that have been with us over the last couple of years. So that is -- means that if you look at the data, for example, in Q4, those earnings over $100,000 in consumers, actually with that particular group, we actually grew over 13% in terms of consumption. And at the same time, we're making sure that as consumers going to club, we are actually increasing the number of offerings, whether it's Mac & Cheese and JELL-O in terms of club and those consumers are going to dollar stores, we're actually improving the number of SKUs that we have available to them. So that way, there's a point in which they can come into the category and those who are choosing to look at value in terms of club sizes, we also have those formats. So it is for us to be agile in terms of how we think about the consumer continue to change, and we've been having an offer that provides the best value for them regardless of the socioeconomic situation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman : Just hoping to get a better sense of the magnitude of the gross margin improvement you're expecting this year. And besides the obvious ones in terms of the cadence of inflation, if there's any considerations we should have about maybe the timing from quarter-to-quarter of that improvement?\nMiguel Patricio : Andre, please?\nAndre Maciel : Hi, Ken. Good morning. Thanks for the question. You have seen that in Q4, we happened to have -- that we said we would have a relevant sequential improvement, which put us in Q4 in line with the 2019 gross margins. We expect in Q1 to maybe the gross margin to go a little bit down as we have contracts that are getting renewed and some inflation that was not passed over to us last year, now is going to affect us. And we had that contemplated in our guidance. But then -- but you should expect somewhere close to flattish in Q1 compared to prior year and from there you should start to see expansion on a year-over-year basis. In terms of a ballpark, you should think about 50 bps to 100 bps, so on magnitude of gross margin expansion, which that is what's allowing us to increase investments behind marketing, technology and people, which are so important to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.\nPamela Kaufman : Can you talk about the competitive dynamics within your categories? In the prepared remarks, you indicated that private label share is increasing, but that is primarily coming from your branded competitors. So maybe if you could just elaborate on what you're seeing there? That would be helpful.\nMiguel Patricio : Maybe Andre and Carlos can comment on that.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : Sure. Let me start. Thank you for the question, by the way. As you saw, and let me speak for the North America business first, and then maybe Andre can give you his perspective over other company. We do see the continued share improvements as we continue to go forward. I mean, in Q4, you saw that misadjusted share actually improved by 20 basis points. And when you look at the market share that is now misadjusted in December, it actually was flat. And what we're seeing is that the bet that we're making in terms of continuing to invest in our businesses in terms of renovating our key products, making sure we're invest in innovation, make sure we invest in our marketing, that actually is paying us. So when you see that in terms of those particular platforms and brands that we want to continue to drive our growth are, in fact, driving the share improvements as well, whether that is in places like Lunchables, in places like Kraft Cheese, in places like Heinz Ketchup, Mac & Cheese, all those going to drive actually positive shares as you look at Q4. So for us is, how do we continue to make sure we're built on those. At the same time, that we are also making sure we have relatively the potential still some supply chain constraints that we have in a couple of categories. So for us, it's making sure that as we are driving the investments that we're making in the brands, that those are, in fact, already transferring into share improvements and now making sure that we are continuing to support the brands that are still a little bit challenged in terms of supply chain so that we can, in fact, unleash the continued growth of our retail environment. \nMiguel Patricio: Andre, do you want to talk about is there anything you would like to add from an international standpoint on this question?\nAndre Maciel : Probably the only thing is that we have to look a bit of different regions, right? Because I mean in Europe, indeed, the situation is a bit tougher from a private label perspective, growing more. I mean the price gap has been widening, although the private label has been put in price the same, but the gap has been widened. I mean, we have put a lot of initiatives in place like relaunching value brands where we are not like we didn't have to -- like HP being an example, that is in the fast process category. So -- and then also do a lot of activities in price spec architecture. So this is like -- it's really keeping us strong, especially versus branded competition. But then in the rest of the world, in emerging markets, specifically, you don't see that much of private label issue and we continue to gain share.\nMiguel Patricio : Okay. Yes. Just to put it in perspective, retail in Europe is about 5% of our business, and that's what Rafael was talking about. I just want to add to these points that 2/3 of our growth are coming from emerging markets and from foodservice. And on these two channels, we continue gaining share and growing in a very, very positive way, double digit?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Powers : Two questions. The first one is on service levels and fill rates. On Slide 16, you got -- you show how you've seen improvement in the fourth quarter, really every month within the fourth quarter. I guess question is -- number one on this is, just has that improvement continued into '23 thus far? And what have you really assumed sort of as the base case for '23 relative to the ultimate goal of getting back to the high 90s. Is that an assumption in the guidance? Or is that more of an aspiration to have some less than allowances in the outlook?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : It's Carlos. Let me comment. So to give you a perspective, I guess, the way we see it kind of in North America, as you said, we are, in fact, seeing progress in our supply chain and our service level. In fact, when I look at December numbers, those were the highest service levels we had across the entire year. Now at the same time, we are still seeing the industry having continued to see some challenges, particularly upstream when you think about ingredients and some packaging materials. Now as we go forward, our goal is, in fact, to get to the kind of service levels that our customers and we did towards the end of the year.  I think for us, what we are seeing is that the recovery in some of the ingredients and packages, it comes in very asymmetrical. So if you think about for us, we're still with the remnant of the avian flu and the impact that, that had in terms of the industry, in some of our business in [indiscernible] and in places like in our cream cheese soft business where some packaging materials have been a challenge. And those -- so those are the type of things that now we're working through. It's places where, in fact, while most things are beginning to come in the terms of more stable supply chain, there are still a couple of places where we are seeing some of those kind of challenges. At the same time, our team is making sure that we are adapting to every situation that's happening. And I'll give you an example of that, which is, as you saw, the price of eggs go so high, we need to make sure that we also are adapting the products that go with eggs. So a product like Just Crack an Egg, we need to make sure we actually brought down the inventories to make sure that understand that consumers may not be having a reduced demand on that type of product. So we are both focused on how do we make sure we continue to drive that service levels towards the 98%, which is our goal. And then secondly is making sure that as we do that, we are agile in term responding to those specifically ingredients that may be challenged in the short term, but that we see improving significantly as we exit 2023.\nStephen Powers : Okay. Great. If I could follow up also -- sorry. \nMiguel Patricio : Go ahead.\nStephen Powers : I was just going to ask if I could follow up on the elasticity point that you've been talking about. You also exited the year with elasticity sort of at their most favorable point, just kind of going off the data on Slide 9. You've obviously talked about assumption of those elasticities sort of normalize directionally through '23. I guess the question is just what's your base case assumption of the pacing of that normalization? And you talk about an ultimate assumption of not going all the way back to historical elasticity. So just how do we think about that as we expect '23 to be sort of the mirror image of '22 from an elasticity standpoint? Or any more color you can offer around that would be great.\nMiguel Patricio : Andre?\nAndre Maciel : Yes. So look, as we have said, right, we contemplated the guidance that elasticities gradually go back to the historical levels, and we expect historical levels in the guidance to be established towards the end of the year. And we expect Q1 to be the way that we contemplated now to be a little worse than it was in Q4, and again, it goes -- if you want to think about that linearly going back to historical levels towards the end of the year. There are obviously things that we keep a close eye on, like we are obviously fully aware and have put the actions in place on its net reduction in the subsidies, which is happening when that has implications and we are ready for that. So I mean we are monitoring each of those things, right? But we believe that elasticities will normally graduate back to the historic plans.\nAndre Maciel: Carlos, do you want to say anything about the actions that you're taking?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : Yes, I think for us, Andre said, we have seen this coming. So for us, it's making sure that we continue to provide great value to consumers regardless of the situation they're in. And I think as I mentioned earlier, for us, it is making sure we use kind of the full price size architecture in terms of options for consumers so that make sure that we also maintain them in the franchise. And that we talked about in terms of our promotion levels, we're using much more rigorous way in which we can understand the ROIs of investments so that consumers are looking for particular events, whether it's certain key holidays and so forth. We are present but in a way that actually allows us to be in a much more positive ROI than in the past. So it is part of what we see. And like Andre said, in North America, we have seen -- our stance right now is that by the end of the year, we'll go back to historical levels. And we are -- that's the way kind of rebuilding our guidance as we think about 2023. \nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we will take one more question. \nOperator: Sure. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery : I just wanted to drill into your foodservice growth pillar a little bit more. In Slide 13 or 12, I guess it is interesting with some color here. Can you just unpack a little bit of how you're gaining share relative to competitors? Is it new items in existing customers? Is it broadening your distribution into new accounts? And -- is it -- are those customers gaining share? I'm sure there's some components of maybe a few different things. But what's the primary driver of outperformance there?\nMiguel Patricio: Michael, we are having a great momentum in foodservice across the globe, both on U.S. and -- or North America and the international zone. So I will ask Carlos and then Rafael to comment.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : Yes. And I would say North America, I would say, is -- in the items that you mentioned, it's all of them. So we grew in the Q4, we grew about almost more than 20%, and we actually gained share. And for me, the way I kind of look at it is the investments that we have put in place are paying us. So we have put new leadership in place. We have simplified our portfolio significantly, reducing almost 50% of the number of SKUs that we had only a couple of years ago. We have renovated our foodservice portfolio. We're bolstering kind of our sales team to make sure they drive distribution in the right places. And more importantly, we're also investing in capacity to make sure we support that growing demand.  So as we look forward -- and just to give you a sense of the opportunity here is we still are only in 25 or top 50 QSR in the U.S. So we know that everything that we're doing continues to be an opportunity for us to further drive growth. And then going back specifically to your question is already what we have seen is that we are in fact expanding distribution across all areas of foodservice. We are winning with distributors. So we're actually expanding with key distributors at present. We're actually also expanding with no commercial accounts. So if you think about hospitalities and particular distributors who service those kind of non-commercial businesses, we have also made an effort against those, and those are working. We have expanded in new restaurants, with things like Fast Casual, think about from -- that is a type of restaurants that we actually have now increased the number of items we sell into them. And QSR, which continues to be a focus for us as a company. From Papa John to Pollo Tropical are places in which we are actually now expanding the number of SKUs we sell into. So it's an area that we continue to be bullish on, and we -- and why one of the places that we feel that we can be winning globally. And with that, I mean Rafael, if you want to build on the...\nMiguel Patricio: Before, Rafael, I'll just build on one thing Carlos mentioned. One of the reasons of our improvement in growth as well is capacity. We've been investing throughout these years on capacity on foodservice, and we continue to do so. So now in May, we will have an extra 25% capacity in the U.S. on pouches and we'll have 50% more capacity on paper and squeeze, which are absolutely critical items for the growth of foodservice. With that in mind, Rafael, please go ahead. \nRafael Oliveira : Sure. Carlos, has been already said about our bright spot of foodservice. And I guess you'll see next week on CAGNY, we're going to go deeper on the reasons for success. But I would say two things that are adding up on the international front where we are winning. And indeed, they are growing a lot and winning big timeshare in foodservice. One is global partnerships. We're really leveraging our scale and then global capabilities to offer our partners like more insights and customized solutions. Remember, many times, we compete with local players, but we're having this global insight makes a big difference for us to test innovation on market and when successful scale up to additional markets. And we've been building this model and replicating consistently across the globe and it\u2019s working really well. The second point is what we call the chef-led model. I mean that could be called our secret sauce, let's say, in foodservice. The strategy evolves around like talent chefs. I mean, basically, if you don't have a chef it's very easy to be on a discussion of price-led discussion basically transactional only. And when we bring our chef to the conversation, we're really partnering with the customers in different needs identifying menu concepts fit for their specific projects. And those two things, although sometimes basic, like the execution, the perfect execution of it is what\u2019s driving the foodservice.  And just to remind within international foodservice still, although growing very strongly, it's 1/3 smaller as a percentage of the faced attrition than in the U.S. So although like we say size of the business comparable, we mean like we have a lot of room to grow in foodservice. So definitely, we hope we're going to continue to see very good strong success with this within the next quarters and years.\nMiguel Patricio : Thank you, Rafael. On a nutshell, I would say that on foodservice, I think in the past, we were very transactional, and we define this as one of the strategic pillars for us for growth, and we've been investing on talent, with technology, on people, on portfolio and it's paying off. I mean we are very excited with that. Anne-Marie?\nAnne-Marie Megela : Yes. So that will wrap up our Q&A session. Thank you all for your call. I am going to turn it over to Miguel for some closing comments.\nMiguel Patricio : I just want to say that we continue to be very excited about what we are doing. We see our transformation evolving. The journey still very far from finishing but we are evolving every day. And why are we so excited? We are excited because we see the momentum building service level up, market share, especially in the growth platform is growing. Foodservice and emerging markets are gaining market share and with a great momentum. Second, we see a very different level of agility in our company. We have today a very agile organization that is able to change, to adapt, to predict much better than in the past. We are investing to grow. Gross margin expansion feeds investments in technology, in people, in marketing, in R&D. We are excited as well because we anticipated pricing and today, we have 99% of all our pricing for 2023 already announced. We have about 95% of our pricing already accepted, and we have about 90% already implemented. And so the way we see it, we'll continue delivering quarter-after-quarter year-after-year.  With that, thank you so much for your attention, and I expect to see you on CAGNY next week. I think we have a lot of excitement to share with you. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

We have come so far on our transformation journey. It's quite amazing. And the fourth quarter was no exception. You can see the momentum building across our business, service levels and market share trends are improving. Base volumes are positive. We are outpacing the competition in foodservice and emerging markets and by a lot. And importantly, we continue to invest for growth. Once again, we have unlocked efficiencies over $400 million this year, and this allow us to invest in new tools and capabilities for our teams, a new product innovation for our consumers.  From a pricing perspective, 99% of all needed pricing has already been announced for 2023. As we look to the rest of the year, we have no current plan to announce new pricing in North America, Europe, Latin America and most of Asia. I am very optimistic. I'm very excited about how we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. With that, I'll ask Andre, Carlos and Rafael to join me. So let's open the call for the Q&A. Thank you, Andrew, for the question. Andre, could you answer this question? Maybe, Andre, you can start and then Carlos comment specifically in U.S. Andre? Andre, please?

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Sure. Hi, Andrew. Good morning again. And thanks for the question and thanks a lot for noticing it. In fact, we feel very proud about what we have been achieving as a company. And I think in 2023, we will mark another step-up in our performance. And as we all notice, we are on the long-term algorithm already on net sales and also on EBITDA, if we remove the effects from currency and from the 53rd week. And I think this is the best way to show that transformation is working through results, right? And it's good to see how 2022 that we finished in very strong momentum, how that's translating into a stronger performance in 2023. This is a consequence of our market share in the U.S. continuing to improve. Still negative but improving, as foodservice continues to deliver at high at above 30%, emerging markets growing double-digits in a strong rate. So all these, in terms of growth, are working in our favor.  Supply chain efficiencies continue to happen. And in 2023, as you might have noticed in guidance, we are expanding gross margin and see our path to go back to 2019 levels, which is allowing us to continue to increase the investment in the business for growth. So we are in 2023 increasing investments behind marketing, technology and people, which are critical levers for us to fuel the growth of the company. So we feel good about, where we are moving. We still want to do, but we will. Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, as we said, as you have seen throughout 2022, we had to rebuild inventory. Our case fill rate at the end of '21 was in the low 80s, which is extremely low. So we had a lot of recovery to do. So you have seen throughout the year, the effect of us build inventory. Keep in mind that we finished 2022 is still in the low 90s. So it's still not what retailers are expecting it should be and what we expect ourselves should be.  Being said that, we do have, compared to historical levels, higher inventory coverage in average in raw and package materials, also, which is normal because we're also trying to build the buffers given all the volatility and uncertainty. So we expect that those raw and package materials should decline over time, including starting in 2023. And in finished goods, even though we need to increase inventory in certain spots where the inventory service levels are still low, we still have a lot of opportunity to rebalance our inventory across the network. I think one of the consequences of the pandemic, the demand volatility is that we started to have inventory straight in the wrong warehouses to meet the demand. And that takes time to sort itself out, right, because of actual cost of product and shipping items across the network. So because of these effects and all the investments that we have made in the past two years to automate demand forecast, we are investing a lot of resources in better supply planning. We are -- we have a big project starting -- that already started to network simplification. So the combination of these investments, plus the rebalance of the network, plus we going back to the more historical levels of averaging raw and package materials should start to system recovering inventory starting '23, but -- or into the future. So free cash flow will be better than 2022. We were still not going to be in the long-term algorithm of 100%, and that's in great part because of CapEx investments. As we have said as well during -- when we unveiled the long-term algorithm, we are investing for growth. And we have stepped up investment in CapEx. You have seen in 2022, we are spending a little more than $900 million, which is a big increase versus $700 million, $750 million that were in the past. We are ramping up this again in 2023 and 2024 as part of our long-term plan. And then we should go back down to closer to 3.5% of net sales starting 2025. That's the current perspective. So when the CapEx starts to come down, that will help us to give the step-up change to go back to achieve the 100% as we said the long-term outlook. So this year, I mean -- if you want to expect something this year, it should be like about 80% or so is going to have addressable back in line. Yes. So -- and thanks for the question. We have increased trade investment in a very significant way from 2017 to '19, more than $1 billion in the United States alone. So we have restarted from a very high base. We increased late 2019. We created a centralized revenue management organization. We have more than 50 people fully dedicated to that in North America alone, and we have started to gathering power of our sales organization. We put a lot of discipline and science behind making promotional decisions in a way that benefits us and retailers. And you have seen a lot of that coming to fruition now in the results of the last three years. That is obviously an impact from service level as well. But just to put in perspective, if you look at Q4 volume sold on promotion, we had about 24% of volume sold on promotion in Q4 '22. That's higher than 2021, but above 23% as a 2 percentage point in the past, still lower than the branded competitors in our categories. But in 2019, it was 34%. So that's too much. And if you look at where we are right now in terms of promotional investments, we still have a significant amount of promotions that have negative ROIs. So it's not about cutting promotions, it's about deploying it in a smarter way. So we are in the journey, and we have seen the results from that, but there's still a lot of opportunities for us to go ahead. We will deploy it, and want it step-increasing. It is not for me to give you a precise number of where this is going to land. But what I can tell you with confidence is that we're not going to get anywhere close to 2019 levels. Yes. Hi, Cody, thanks for the question. So as well noted, we are finishing Q4 growing about 10%. And we just have a new round of price that we just implemented. So that certainly has a positive effect in the first half of the year. We expect gradually throughout the year for us to be -- as we circulate the price increases from last year that we end up landing in the second half on something closer to our long-term growth algorithm, okay? Being said that, the growth in 2023 is all driven by price. So volume is still negative. Obviously, it improves throughout the quarters as we start to lap the prices. But even at the end of the year, will still be negative. That's something that as we think about the future, it's not the negative balance that we want. We want a good balance as we think about top line growth between price and volume. And we're going to talk a lot about that the next week in CAGNY. We have contemplated the guidance and increased level of elasticity compared to what we saw in 2022, but still not the way up to the historical levels.  In terms of what gives confidence. So you saw the sell-out for the industry to our Q4 was still very strong. In fact, if you look at sell-out elastic, just looking at price and volume based on the sell-out, Q4 was better than any other quarter in the year. Now we obviously need to -- we need to keep actively monitoring and we are because throughout this year, we can see maybe consumers will change the behavior. Carlos, do you want to comment something on that? Hi, Ken. Good morning. Thanks for the question. You have seen that in Q4, we happened to have -- that we said we would have a relevant sequential improvement, which put us in Q4 in line with the 2019 gross margins. We expect in Q1 to maybe the gross margin to go a little bit down as we have contracts that are getting renewed and some inflation that was not passed over to us last year, now is going to affect us. And we had that contemplated in our guidance. But then -- but you should expect somewhere close to flattish in Q1 compared to prior year and from there you should start to see expansion on a year-over-year basis. In terms of a ballpark, you should think about 50 bps to 100 bps, so on magnitude of gross margin expansion, which that is what's allowing us to increase investments behind marketing, technology and people, which are so important to us. Probably the only thing is that we have to look a bit of different regions, right? Because I mean in Europe, indeed, the situation is a bit tougher from a private label perspective, growing more. I mean the price gap has been widening, although the private label has been put in price the same, but the gap has been widened. I mean, we have put a lot of initiatives in place like relaunching value brands where we are not like we didn't have to -- like HP being an example, that is in the fast process category. So -- and then also do a lot of activities in price spec architecture. So this is like -- it's really keeping us strong, especially versus branded competition. But then in the rest of the world, in emerging markets, specifically, you don't see that much of private label issue and we continue to gain share. Yes. So look, as we have said, right, we contemplated the guidance that elasticities gradually go back to the historical levels, and we expect historical levels in the guidance to be established towards the end of the year. And we expect Q1 to be the way that we contemplated now to be a little worse than it was in Q4, and again, it goes -- if you want to think about that linearly going back to historical levels towards the end of the year. There are obviously things that we keep a close eye on, like we are obviously fully aware and have put the actions in place on its net reduction in the subsidies, which is happening when that has implications and we are ready for that. So I mean we are monitoring each of those things, right? But we believe that elasticities will normally graduate back to the historic plans. Carlos, do you want to say anything about the actions that you're taking?"

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Yes. Let me -- it's Carlos here, Chris. Listen, what I would say is just building on some of the comments that Andre just mentioned is that as we think about promotional activity going forward, it really is about being surgical about how we invest those promotion dollars. Thinking through making them around event-based activity. So that way, we are thinking through how do we make sure that we are driving the best utilization of that particular event versus a price-based activity. And I think what happens then is it allows us to actually make sure we are focused in terms of driving positive ROIs. And I think if you -- as you heard from Andre, we have made a huge thrive from where we went to 2019, and we're not going back. In fact, when you look at some of our focus on improving the ROI of our programs, today, on average, if you think of 2022 versus 2019, we've actually tripled the level of ROI returns of our promotions from three years ago. So again, it is a signal that all the investments we're doing in terms of revenue management are agile still work in terms of better understanding how to read the data and how to utilize our funding is actually driving specifically better ROI in every funding that we're doing. The one thing I would add there, Cody, is the fact that we also are making sure that we continue to expand in terms of -- in the number of formats and price points that we offer within our categories to make sure we maintain the consumers that have been with us over the last couple of years. So that is -- means that if you look at the data, for example, in Q4, those earnings over $100,000 in consumers, actually with that particular group, we actually grew over 13% in terms of consumption. And at the same time, we're making sure that as consumers going to club, we are actually increasing the number of offerings, whether it's Mac & Cheese and JELL-O in terms of club and those consumers are going to dollar stores, we're actually improving the number of SKUs that we have available to them. So that way, there's a point in which they can come into the category and those who are choosing to look at value in terms of club sizes, we also have those formats. So it is for us to be agile in terms of how we think about the consumer continue to change, and we've been having an offer that provides the best value for them regardless of the socioeconomic situation. Sure. Let me start. Thank you for the question, by the way. As you saw, and let me speak for the North America business first, and then maybe Andre can give you his perspective over other company. We do see the continued share improvements as we continue to go forward. I mean, in Q4, you saw that misadjusted share actually improved by 20 basis points. And when you look at the market share that is now misadjusted in December, it actually was flat. And what we're seeing is that the bet that we're making in terms of continuing to invest in our businesses in terms of renovating our key products, making sure we're invest in innovation, make sure we invest in our marketing, that actually is paying us. So when you see that in terms of those particular platforms and brands that we want to continue to drive our growth are, in fact, driving the share improvements as well, whether that is in places like Lunchables, in places like Kraft Cheese, in places like Heinz Ketchup, Mac & Cheese, all those going to drive actually positive shares as you look at Q4. So for us is, how do we continue to make sure we're built on those. At the same time, that we are also making sure we have relatively the potential still some supply chain constraints that we have in a couple of categories. So for us, it's making sure that as we are driving the investments that we're making in the brands, that those are, in fact, already transferring into share improvements and now making sure that we are continuing to support the brands that are still a little bit challenged in terms of supply chain so that we can, in fact, unleash the continued growth of our retail environment. It's Carlos. Let me comment. So to give you a perspective, I guess, the way we see it kind of in North America, as you said, we are, in fact, seeing progress in our supply chain and our service level. In fact, when I look at December numbers, those were the highest service levels we had across the entire year. Now at the same time, we are still seeing the industry having continued to see some challenges, particularly upstream when you think about ingredients and some packaging materials. Now as we go forward, our goal is, in fact, to get to the kind of service levels that our customers and we did towards the end of the year.  I think for us, what we are seeing is that the recovery in some of the ingredients and packages, it comes in very asymmetrical. So if you think about for us, we're still with the remnant of the avian flu and the impact that, that had in terms of the industry, in some of our business in [indiscernible] and in places like in our cream cheese soft business where some packaging materials have been a challenge. And those -- so those are the type of things that now we're working through. It's places where, in fact, while most things are beginning to come in the terms of more stable supply chain, there are still a couple of places where we are seeing some of those kind of challenges. At the same time, our team is making sure that we are adapting to every situation that's happening. And I'll give you an example of that, which is, as you saw, the price of eggs go so high, we need to make sure that we also are adapting the products that go with eggs. So a product like Just Crack an Egg, we need to make sure we actually brought down the inventories to make sure that understand that consumers may not be having a reduced demand on that type of product. So we are both focused on how do we make sure we continue to drive that service levels towards the 98%, which is our goal. And then secondly is making sure that as we do that, we are agile in term responding to those specifically ingredients that may be challenged in the short term, but that we see improving significantly as we exit 2023. Yes, I think for us, Andre said, we have seen this coming. So for us, it's making sure that we continue to provide great value to consumers regardless of the situation they're in. And I think as I mentioned earlier, for us, it is making sure we use kind of the full price size architecture in terms of options for consumers so that make sure that we also maintain them in the franchise. And that we talked about in terms of our promotion levels, we're using much more rigorous way in which we can understand the ROIs of investments so that consumers are looking for particular events, whether it's certain key holidays and so forth. We are present but in a way that actually allows us to be in a much more positive ROI than in the past. So it is part of what we see. And like Andre said, in North America, we have seen -- our stance right now is that by the end of the year, we'll go back to historical levels. And we are -- that's the way kind of rebuilding our guidance as we think about 2023. Yes. And I would say North America, I would say, is -- in the items that you mentioned, it's all of them. So we grew in the Q4, we grew about almost more than 20%, and we actually gained share. And for me, the way I kind of look at it is the investments that we have put in place are paying us. So we have put new leadership in place. We have simplified our portfolio significantly, reducing almost 50% of the number of SKUs that we had only a couple of years ago. We have renovated our foodservice portfolio. We're bolstering kind of our sales team to make sure they drive distribution in the right places. And more importantly, we're also investing in capacity to make sure we support that growing demand.  So as we look forward -- and just to give you a sense of the opportunity here is we still are only in 25 or top 50 QSR in the U.S. So we know that everything that we're doing continues to be an opportunity for us to further drive growth. And then going back specifically to your question is already what we have seen is that we are in fact expanding distribution across all areas of foodservice. We are winning with distributors. So we're actually expanding with key distributors at present. We're actually also expanding with no commercial accounts. So if you think about hospitalities and particular distributors who service those kind of non-commercial businesses, we have also made an effort against those, and those are working. We have expanded in new restaurants, with things like Fast Casual, think about from -- that is a type of restaurants that we actually have now increased the number of items we sell into them. And QSR, which continues to be a focus for us as a company. From Papa John to Pollo Tropical are places in which we are actually now expanding the number of SKUs we sell into. So it's an area that we continue to be bullish on, and we -- and why one of the places that we feel that we can be winning globally. And with that, I mean Rafael, if you want to build on the..."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over, Anne-Marie Megela, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our third quarter 2022 business update. During today's call, we may make some forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and its expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.  Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for some brief opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. We are excited. We are proud. We delivered another quarter of strong results. And as we see consumer demand remaining strong and analytic elasticities, they continue to hold. We see our portfolio of iconic brands strong and very adequate for the moment that we are living. And we continue investing in these brands and seeing that this investment is paying off. Yet at the same time, we realize we know that supply chain remains challenging, particularly with inflation and material shortages. I'm proud of the teams as they continue to anticipate and adapt to these challenges, where we improved capacity and we're able to meet demand, we actually gained share. At the same time, we continue to advance our transformation, then including modernizing our marketing and transforming our portfolio.  As we look ahead, we continue cautiously optimistic. We are providing our consumers with solutions that they value, and we continue to unlock efficiencies and reinvest in the business. All of which makes us stronger and positions us well for whatever challenges are still to come.  With that, we are very happy to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. I guess maybe to start, the company had moderated its EBITDA expectations back in September 1, third quarter when you were already about 2 months into the quarter. Today, you not only beat those expectations, but came in above the initial guidance as well. So, what came in better than you thought? Are there any timing issues to be aware of that might impact 4Q as a result? And maybe more importantly, do these fluctuations give you any pause with respect to visibility into the business with the understanding that it's obviously still a very dynamic environment.\nMiguel Patricio: Andrew, thank you for the question. Andre, you may answer this one.\nAndre Maciel : So, Andrew, first of all, we -- as Miguel said at the beginning, I think we feel very excited and pleased with the results we achieved in the quarter. And I'll tell you that a lot of things happened in our favor towards the month of September. First of all, if you might remember, we have executed a new price increase in the month of August. And the elasticities turned out to be stronger than what is anticipated, which resulted in strong top line. Shipments were very good. I think our team did a great job in the month of September to be able to ship in a much better pace than earlier in the quarter, which also helped us. We end up spending less promotion also that we have initially anticipated, which is fine, as well that we're being very prudent to put all the promotions and expense in our portfolio. And finally, we did have about $30 billion of one-time gains in the P&L, 80% in costs, 20% in SG&A. And those are mostly anticipation from Q4, okay? That's what we're able to do in Q3. And obviously, we also had a little contingency, given the volatility, right? But all in all, I think we're able to have a lot of things play in our favor. I think it is a testimony here that organization is moving with the speed and reacting fast to diversities. And we delivered and maintained our guidance fully here in Q3, right? And so I think we felt confident about the number that we\u2019ve put a lever and I think we\u2019re just reinforcing that now by [regular thought]. And you can count on us, all is true being a transparent dialogue and being -- in a very friendly fashion, like we did back in the September when I heard the first news about the inflationary pressure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: You mentioned that your supply chain tightness is still mostly caused by factors from your upstream suppliers. This is not an uncommon refrain. We're certainly hearing this from many of your peers. I'm just curious, can you maybe help us better understand what the specific issues are. You mentioned disruptions, I guess, on ingredients and packaging. Does this suggest that the issues are somewhat temporary. They can fade when the disruptions have passed? Or are there maybe some structural problems, I guess, that could take longer to fix?\nMiguel Patricio: Carlos, I think that's related to you. Go ahead, please.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. What I would say -- first of all, thank you for the question. What I'll say is that I think you can see that the environment continues to be challenging. And what I'm really proud is the fact that our team is doing a terrific job of working through the wave of challenges. So, as we speak, we are both rebuilding inventory and improving service levels, and we have done that through the quarter -- sequentially in each quarter. I think we continue to see that going forward.  I think what -- if I take a step back in terms of the overall constraints, what I see is about 80% of those challenges are really due to upstream supply distribution on ingredients and certain packaging materials. At the same time, what I'm saying is it's very asynchronistic the way they're recovering. So, you'll see that in some cases, we are moving quickly and recovering overall in our supply chain. There's a few ingredients that have been a little tighter for us. And I point to things like have affected us in the past and things like cold cuts and lunch -- I'm sorry, in cream cheese. And at the same time, even in those categories, we now have recovered and feel good about kind of our position as we go towards the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: To build on the previous 2 questions, you're kind of looking at the current environment now dealing with what you're dealing with numbers and seeing what you're seeing in the marketplace? Is there any reason that we shouldn't expect that your long-term targets, which you laid out back in -- or you talked a bit about back in September are targets that we should expect that those are achievable for 2023? Or is this environment still maybe too volatile to be in line with what your long-term targets would be.\nMiguel Patricio: Andre, you may want to answer this question.\nAndre Maciel : Sure. Look, as we said back in CAGNY, when we unveiled our new long-term growth for the reason, we expect to get that over the years. So think of it in terms of 3 years or so. So we feel good in our continued improvement, in our performance and we expect to continue to move towards the algorithm, the way that we have communicated back then. We are probably not ready to give any guidance around \u201823. But yes, the environment is still volatile. As you have been hearing from us and public promoters in the sector about supply chain volatility, which has consequences on availability and they speed up using our costs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChrisGrowe: I just had a quick question for you in relation to, you showed in one of your charts in the slide deck, private label gaining more share in your categories. It also showed Kraft Heinz doing much better in its categories as well. And as we look across the store, private label share has been up at a lesser rate over the past few months, although it seems like it's gone up a little bit more so in your categories. I just want to get a sense of if you see incremental risk in your categories from private label share gains as you take more pricing where you have more pricing that's been put in place? And then just any change in your thoughts on elasticity in relation to your pricing, which has been very favorable for your business? \nMiguel Patricio: Andre, do you want to answer the question?\nAndre Maciel : Sure. Thanks for the question. On private label, a few things. First of all, as we have been continuously reiterating our exposure to private label have reduced significantly after the [diversion] mid last year. So now the average market share in our portfolio is about 11%, wherein across food and beverage is 20%. So that were not impacted. Second, during the past 3 years, as part of our transformation, we have been directing a lot of our effort and energy around the core. So resources have moved that. We have been renovating the core in a very systematic way, so our portfolio is stronger. Third, the private label have been increasing the price together with the rest of the players. So as recent as the last 4 weeks, including already 3 weeks of October looking at sellout data, our sellout price is about 17% up, whereas private label is 16% up. So price gaps are widely preserved. You might have seen as well in 1 of this calendars we provided that comparing Q2 to Q3, the price gap with private label remains the same. So we do not see any category where our price gap expanded versus private label except to Ketchup and Lunchables, which honestly the interaction is limited, and we gained share in both of these categories. So yes, I think we feel good about that. We don't want to be even over optimistic that depending on how consumers eventually shifts behavior in a very drastic way, things can change, but there is no indication of that as of right now. And honestly, I mean, despite all the environment, food is proving to be very resilient. The brands are being very resilient. And with unemployment today we see right now, when I was here back in 2008, 2011, we only had this accelerated shift in behavior, but unemployment starts to go up, which is far from the reality today. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. And I think what I would say is we have continued to invest in the equity of our brands, which if we think about the fact that companies really don't have pricing power brands, have pricing -- pricing power. So the investments we have made with the quality of the marketing we have improved here at Kraft Heinz and the commitment we have to continue to invest in our brands going forward, also give us some confidence as we continue to manage through the current environment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.\nAlexia Howard: I mean looking at the lineup of products on Page 19 of the presentation, and they really do seem to be meeting the moment in terms of the consumer need for convenience and affordability. But I'm just wondering about your thoughts on the recent White House Conference on Hunger Health and Nutrition that happened last month for the first time in 50 years, I think. And there were a lot of initiatives coming out of that with respect to Front of Pack labels, a very tight definition of what a healthy food is, educating consumers and health professionals on the importance of good nutrition. And I wonder just how you -- it may be too soon, but how you're thinking about those types of developments in the industry over the coming months and years? And how that might shape your plans for innovation and the portfolio going forward? And I'll pass it on.\nMiguel Patricio: Let me -- I'm glad to start answering this question and then since Carlos wants to complement. Nutrition is part of our long-term strategy. It's part of our agenda. It is a very important part of our ESG goals for the future. We've been renovating our portfolio throughout the years, reducing or eliminating dies and artificial ingredients. And we have global agenda, a very specific agenda on reducing salt and sugar, which are 2 critical things in our portfolio that we have a responsibility to do.  We are on the way to achieve the targets that we put in place until 2025. I mean just to give you an example, we changed the formulation of our Capri Sun this year. We reduced 40% of sugar content, and that's -- to put it in perspective, just that is 40 million pounds of sugar per year that we reduced. We continue committed to that for the short, the medium and the long term to make our products more nutritious.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: But I would add to Miguel's point, which I think is right on, is the fact that this is a commitment we have for the long term. Every single time we are renovating our portfolio, we're putting in kind of the view of how do we continue to improve our products overall, not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because that's what consumers want us to do. So I think that is happening and obviously, you can see it very clearly in terms of commitment to sugar reduction, salt reduction, we continue to work with communities and improving the food and security situation. And this is something that as a company we are committed to and we'll continue to as we go forward.\nMiguel Patricio: We are buyer of tomatoes and beans. And in the heart, we are agricultural company. And we've been investing a lot in that sense in client base. I mean you see what we are doing in Europe with our beans with a project of launching new beans based products with Heinz Beanz Burgerz, with Heinz Beanz [Hams], Protein Pots and a portfolio of innovation for the next 5 years related to that. And here in the U.S., we are very proud to announce this week that we are launching our plant-based cheese, which by the way, is an incredible product, very different from what is in the market. It melts, it tastes like cheese, it smells like cheese and melts like cheese and its very different from everything that is in the market. So we're absolutely committed on the nutritional agenda.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: I wanted to ask on gross margin progression. Across the consumer goods space broadly, I think we're beginning to see more signs an evidence of gross margin stabilization, if not recovery, with results across many companies either coming in ahead of consensus expectations or improving sequentially or even starting to improve year-over-year. And every portfolio is obviously different, but you're not yet in that position. So I am curious as to how you're thinking about the progress of gross margin? What kind of framing of expectations we should have going into the fourth quarter? And the prospects for improvement as we build into fiscal '23?\nMiguel Patricio: Andre, you may answer this question, please. \nAndre Maciel : Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, we have been -- as we said all along, have pricing to protect the dollar inflation, so dollar for dollar, and we have been doing that now for the second quarter in a row. So both in Q2 and now in Q3, price was in line with inflation and price plus gross efficiencies was ahead of inflation. Given that we had in Q3 as we initially said back in September, some incremental pressure in selected places and we took action already on it, there is this continuous lag in effect. So we expect Q3 to be the bottom of our gross margin, and you should expect to see a sequential improvement in Q4 in comparison to Q3. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Just a follow-up on some of the supply chain stuff. Your case fill rates in your slide deck, you say -- they were in the low 90s in the third quarter, and that's better than the high 80s than it was in the first quarter. But I was slightly surprised to see that, that fill rate was the same as 2Q. Is that a result of that upstream supplier effect that you're talking about. And I'm wondering how you're thinking about progress there. Is that -- is that some -- do you have visibilities to getting that fill rate back? I'm sure you want to get back to the high '90s. And what -- when could we expect bigger leaps and improvement in fill rates?\nMiguel Patricio: David thanks for the question. Carlos, please.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Listen, what I'll say is that exactly what you said, it is connected to the availability of certain ingredients in the -- of the upstream. But at the same time, our commitment with our customers is continue to improve that. I'll tell you that as we continue to navigate the situation in terms of those capacity constraints, what I'll say is that we also are looking to see how we lead with the capacity that we have available to us. And let me give you a couple of examples of how we're doing that.  We actually are ingesting data directly from our customers in a way that allows us to better deploy our inventory to reduce out of stocks. We started that with a pilot with 1 particular retailer and that allows us to actually reduce the amount of inventory by 40%. The out-of-stocks in their stores, by 40% in a period of about 8 weeks. We now have expanded that program and now we're ingesting more data from different customers that allows you to then make sure that we are then putting the right inventory in the right stores and green the right signals into our production so that we can maximize the availability capacity that we have in our plants.  So we're both working upstream with suppliers, but it's also us being smarter and better capabilities internally to deploy our inventory to improve overall service levels, which we're committed to do. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho.\nJohn Baumgartner: Miguel, I was wondering if you can touch on the nice rehearsal you had in Q3 regarding market shares relative to your branded competition. How would you break that down between the benefits from some of the supply chain constraints easing, the pricing differentials in the market as opposed to how much of that is derived from just underlying changes to your execution in the market on more of a like-for-like basis, and how sustainable do you think that performance will be in the share gains versus brands going forward?\nMiguel Patricio: Thanks for the question. So let me give you my perspective, and then Carlos can go further on that answer, right? We are excited to keep the levels of market share even with the problems that we continue facing on supply. I mean, we would be gaining a lot of share if we would not be facing still shortages on raw materials. A good proof of that is like Capri Sun and Lunchables, where in the previous quarters, we had problems with supply charters of raw materials we lost this year, and now we are in rocket -- record share gains on these 2 brands. So I actually am optimistic that we can move further on market share. Carlos, please? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. I would say to build on Miguel's point, this is a combination of the continuing investments that we have made in renovating our brands, investment in improving the quality of our marketing communication. And then, as you said, unlocking some of the capacity in some key brands. I think the example Miguel gave around Lunchables and Capri Sun in which we saw the improvement on inventory and CFR and then our ability to actually then go into market and then drive event-based promotions that allows to then continue to grow those particular categories during the back-to-school period, which was basically a phenomenal result for us in terms of performance. As we go forward, when you see the places that continue to have challenges in terms of capacity, we know that once we unlock those we also have opportunity to then continue to grow our consumption as we go forward. And those, as I said before, areas like our Cold [indiscernible] and Cream Cheese that are slowly getting into better positioning our inventory. And now as we go into the holidays, making sure we protect the ability to then go into those event-based promotions we were doing the time of year that consumers are really looking for our brands.  So when you take a step back, I will say, is a great combination of the work we have done over the last 1.5 years for us to improve internally the equity of our company. And at the same time now, see the benefit of us being able to now go back into the marketplace in a more aggressive way that allows to then continue to drive consumption and whole penetration on our brands.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to the foodservice opportunity you've called out. And I think specifically, you said roughly half of the top 50 QSRs are distribution opportunities for you. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what's kept you from already being in some of those accounts? How sticky are those relationships? And what's sort of realistically the expectations or how many of those could come your way?\nMiguel Patricio: I would ask Carlos to answer that question, and then Rafael is maybe with us on this call to present for International zone, where we have a great momentum in food service, by the way.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. But I think let me start with the comment Miguel just made. I think if you look at our business in the North America and year-to-date, we're growing and growing market share. So we feel very good about our performance so far. And what I will tell you is, for us, it's a critical channel as we go forward. It is one that we really have thought about how do we continue to transform the organization internally. So we have done things like changing the leadership and reorienting our focus from operators to advance distributors -- we have done things like making sure that our food service now has a different role within North America zone that is from what we used to see as basically a stable contributor to now a growth driver. We have simplified and renovated the portfolio. I'll tell you that we have reduced about half of our SKUs that we had in 2019. At the same time, we have improved quality. And then finally, we continue to enhance our overall distribution, overall. Now part of the point that you made around how do we continue to unlock some of the opportunities we have in QSR is us continue to invest in the capacity of the business. So we're also making strong investments in CapEx in order for us to support the opportunity for us to continue growing in our foodservice channel. Over the last 2 years, that number is over $100 million we have invested, so that allows us now the opportunity to have those conversations with QSR in a way that truly unlocks opportunities for us to continue growing. Now that's a view of North America.  Let me pass it out to Rafael to give you a view also of on international side.\nRafael Oliveira: Yes. Look, it's not very similar to that. The opportunity in foodservice is significant. And you can see it has been a core pillar for our results in the last few years, and the quarter is no different. You can see that the numbers we released, we are growing actually very fast and twice the size of the industry, twice the rate of the industry. So you can attribute that part of it was the slowdown that happened during the pandemic. A lot of the -- across international, we do compete with some global players but also with some local players and a lot of them specialize in foodservice that during the pandemic, they suffer a lot and some of them either went bankrupt or had to downsize significantly their operations. We didn't. We maintained the same level of investments and consequently coming out of the pandemic in most of the countries across the world, I mean, we are riding ahead of it. So we continue to be excited. I mean, QSR is the core. Our products, especially within the sauces environment goes very hand-in-hand with the QSR industry, and we still have a long way to go. I mean our estimate with the data available that we are about between 3% and 4% market share of the sauces category of food service. So there is significant room ahead. And we are going to continue to do that, driving our chef-led model, where we have invested in chefs that partner with those customers, driving innovations that have been very well received. So it should be a continuous source of growth, sustainable growth for us.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, Operator. I'm now going to hand it over to Miguel for some closing commentary.\nMiguel Patricio: I would like to finish with a quote. A quote from a famous legendary car racer on Formula 1 that once said, \"If it's raining, I can pass 15 cars. But when it's sunny, I cannot.\" Let me tell you, it's not raining, it's pouring. But we are super excited at this moment because we are seeing this as a great moment of opportunity. And we've been able to navigate through the uncertainties of the short term and adapt and rebuild very fast at the same time that we are continue building our future. We are excited with what we have ahead of us. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Well, thank you, Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. We are excited. We are proud. We delivered another quarter of strong results. And as we see consumer demand remaining strong and analytic elasticities, they continue to hold. We see our portfolio of iconic brands strong and very adequate for the moment that we are living. And we continue investing in these brands and seeing that this investment is paying off. Yet at the same time, we realize we know that supply chain remains challenging, particularly with inflation and material shortages. I'm proud of the teams as they continue to anticipate and adapt to these challenges, where we improved capacity and we're able to meet demand, we actually gained share. At the same time, we continue to advance our transformation, then including modernizing our marketing and transforming our portfolio.  As we look ahead, we continue cautiously optimistic. We are providing our consumers with solutions that they value, and we continue to unlock efficiencies and reinvest in the business. All of which makes us stronger and positions us well for whatever challenges are still to come.  With that, we are very happy to take your questions. Andrew, thank you for the question. Andre, you may answer this one. Carlos, I think that's related to you. Go ahead, please. Andre, you may want to answer this question. Andre, do you want to answer the question? Let me -- I'm glad to start answering this question and then since Carlos wants to complement. Nutrition is part of our long-term strategy. It's part of our agenda. It is a very important part of our ESG goals for the future. We've been renovating our portfolio throughout the years, reducing or eliminating dies and artificial ingredients. And we have global agenda, a very specific agenda on reducing salt and sugar, which are 2 critical things in our portfolio that we have a responsibility to do.  We are on the way to achieve the targets that we put in place until 2025. I mean just to give you an example, we changed the formulation of our Capri Sun this year. We reduced 40% of sugar content, and that's -- to put it in perspective, just that is 40 million pounds of sugar per year that we reduced. We continue committed to that for the short, the medium and the long term to make our products more nutritious. We are buyer of tomatoes and beans. And in the heart, we are agricultural company. And we've been investing a lot in that sense in client base. I mean you see what we are doing in Europe with our beans with a project of launching new beans based products with Heinz Beanz Burgerz, with Heinz Beanz [Hams], Protein Pots and a portfolio of innovation for the next 5 years related to that. And here in the U.S., we are very proud to announce this week that we are launching our plant-based cheese, which by the way, is an incredible product, very different from what is in the market. It melts, it tastes like cheese, it smells like cheese and melts like cheese and its very different from everything that is in the market. So we're absolutely committed on the nutritional agenda. Andre, you may answer this question, please. David thanks for the question. Carlos, please. Thanks for the question. So let me give you my perspective, and then Carlos can go further on that answer, right? We are excited to keep the levels of market share even with the problems that we continue facing on supply. I mean, we would be gaining a lot of share if we would not be facing still shortages on raw materials. A good proof of that is like Capri Sun and Lunchables, where in the previous quarters, we had problems with supply charters of raw materials we lost this year, and now we are in rocket -- record share gains on these 2 brands.

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "So, Andrew, first of all, we -- as Miguel said at the beginning, I think we feel very excited and pleased with the results we achieved in the quarter. And I'll tell you that a lot of things happened in our favor towards the month of September. First of all, if you might remember, we have executed a new price increase in the month of August. And the elasticities turned out to be stronger than what is anticipated, which resulted in strong top line. Shipments were very good. I think our team did a great job in the month of September to be able to ship in a much better pace than earlier in the quarter, which also helped us. We end up spending less promotion also that we have initially anticipated, which is fine, as well that we're being very prudent to put all the promotions and expense in our portfolio. And finally, we did have about $30 billion of one-time gains in the P&L, 80% in costs, 20% in SG&A. And those are mostly anticipation from Q4, okay? That's what we're able to do in Q3. And obviously, we also had a little contingency, given the volatility, right? But all in all, I think we're able to have a lot of things play in our favor. I think it is a testimony here that organization is moving with the speed and reacting fast to diversities. And we delivered and maintained our guidance fully here in Q3, right? And so I think we felt confident about the number that we've put a lever and I think we're just reinforcing that now by [regular thought]. And you can count on us, all is true being a transparent dialogue and being -- in a very friendly fashion, like we did back in the September when I heard the first news about the inflationary pressure. Sure. Look, as we said back in CAGNY, when we unveiled our new long-term growth for the reason, we expect to get that over the years. So think of it in terms of 3 years or so. So we feel good in our continued improvement, in our performance and we expect to continue to move towards the algorithm, the way that we have communicated back then. We are probably not ready to give any guidance around \u201823. But yes, the environment is still volatile. As you have been hearing from us and public promoters in the sector about supply chain volatility, which has consequences on availability and they speed up using our costs. Sure. Thanks for the question. On private label, a few things. First of all, as we have been continuously reiterating our exposure to private label have reduced significantly after the [diversion] mid last year. So now the average market share in our portfolio is about 11%, wherein across food and beverage is 20%. So that were not impacted. Second, during the past 3 years, as part of our transformation, we have been directing a lot of our effort and energy around the core. So resources have moved that. We have been renovating the core in a very systematic way, so our portfolio is stronger. Third, the private label have been increasing the price together with the rest of the players. So as recent as the last 4 weeks, including already 3 weeks of October looking at sellout data, our sellout price is about 17% up, whereas private label is 16% up. So price gaps are widely preserved. You might have seen as well in 1 of this calendars we provided that comparing Q2 to Q3, the price gap with private label remains the same. So we do not see any category where our price gap expanded versus private label except to Ketchup and Lunchables, which honestly the interaction is limited, and we gained share in both of these categories. So yes, I think we feel good about that. We don't want to be even over optimistic that depending on how consumers eventually shifts behavior in a very drastic way, things can change, but there is no indication of that as of right now. And honestly, I mean, despite all the environment, food is proving to be very resilient. The brands are being very resilient. And with unemployment today we see right now, when I was here back in 2008, 2011, we only had this accelerated shift in behavior, but unemployment starts to go up, which is far from the reality today. Sure. Thanks for the question. Look, we have been -- as we said all along, have pricing to protect the dollar inflation, so dollar for dollar, and we have been doing that now for the second quarter in a row. So both in Q2 and now in Q3, price was in line with inflation and price plus gross efficiencies was ahead of inflation. Given that we had in Q3 as we initially said back in September, some incremental pressure in selected places and we took action already on it, there is this continuous lag in effect. So we expect Q3 to be the bottom of our gross margin, and you should expect to see a sequential improvement in Q4 in comparison to Q3."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Yes. What I would say -- first of all, thank you for the question. What I'll say is that I think you can see that the environment continues to be challenging. And what I'm really proud is the fact that our team is doing a terrific job of working through the wave of challenges. So, as we speak, we are both rebuilding inventory and improving service levels, and we have done that through the quarter -- sequentially in each quarter. I think we continue to see that going forward.  I think what -- if I take a step back in terms of the overall constraints, what I see is about 80% of those challenges are really due to upstream supply distribution on ingredients and certain packaging materials. At the same time, what I'm saying is it's very asynchronistic the way they're recovering. So, you'll see that in some cases, we are moving quickly and recovering overall in our supply chain. There's a few ingredients that have been a little tighter for us. And I point to things like have affected us in the past and things like cold cuts and lunch -- I'm sorry, in cream cheese. And at the same time, even in those categories, we now have recovered and feel good about kind of our position as we go towards the end of the year. Yes. And I think what I would say is we have continued to invest in the equity of our brands, which if we think about the fact that companies really don't have pricing power brands, have pricing -- pricing power. So the investments we have made with the quality of the marketing we have improved here at Kraft Heinz and the commitment we have to continue to invest in our brands going forward, also give us some confidence as we continue to manage through the current environment. But I would add to Miguel's point, which I think is right on, is the fact that this is a commitment we have for the long term. Every single time we are renovating our portfolio, we're putting in kind of the view of how do we continue to improve our products overall, not just because it's the right thing to do, but also because that's what consumers want us to do. So I think that is happening and obviously, you can see it very clearly in terms of commitment to sugar reduction, salt reduction, we continue to work with communities and improving the food and security situation. And this is something that as a company we are committed to and we'll continue to as we go forward. Yes. Listen, what I'll say is that exactly what you said, it is connected to the availability of certain ingredients in the -- of the upstream. But at the same time, our commitment with our customers is continue to improve that. I'll tell you that as we continue to navigate the situation in terms of those capacity constraints, what I'll say is that we also are looking to see how we lead with the capacity that we have available to us.

So we're both working upstream with suppliers, but it's also us being smarter and better capabilities internally to deploy our inventory to improve overall service levels, which we're committed to do.

Over the last 2 years, that number is over $100 million we have invested, so that allows us now the opportunity to have those conversations with QSR in a way that truly unlocks opportunities for us to continue growing. Now that's a view of North America.  Let me pass it out to Rafael to give you a view also of on international side."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela. Please go ahead.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2022 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and these are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you, Anne-Marie and thank you everyone for joining us today. I wanted to acknowledge the fact that we are living under a lot of uncertainty in what regards the external world. And in that sense, I want to thank my team and to congratulate my team for delivering another quarter of very solid results. Although, we are mindful of the current inflationary environment and how it affects our consumers and our customers, but we continue to develop solutions that benefit our consumers and our retailers. Our relationships with retailers continue to strengthen, and we have improved inventory and service levels, so we can have now more optionality to execute more mutually strategic programs. Well, with that, we are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. And your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: All right. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I had just one clarification question and then a second question. The first one, just as a clarification. Andre, in the slide deck, I think it's slide 27, where you talk about the there's a portion or a section in there about gross margin and it shows gross margin at 30.3%. Just want to make sure that that is not adjusted, right? So, that's just your gross margin. I think, as we did the adjusted gross margin calculation, it was like 31.5%. So, just wanted to clarify that, that margin that you're -- that you put in slide deck is reported not adjusted.\nAndre Maciel: Good morning, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Very good, by the way. So, yes, you are right. So, this is the GAAP gross margin. So, to get adjusted, we need to increase this number by 110 basis points due to the change of realized hedge on commodities. Okay. And in fact, if we adjust for that, our margin in Q2 is pretty much in line with the margin in Q1.\nBryan Spillane: Okay.\nAndre Maciel: And if you compare to prior year, you would see an expansion of margin if were not for the dilutive impact of repricing to offset inflation.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my question is just in the prepared remarks, Miguel, you talked a little bit about, I think there's still being supply chain pressures in the back half of the year and -- or currently I suppose. And if I recalling last year where part of what happened in the U.S. was, you had some supply chain issues and they affected service levels, especially around the holidays. Are -- I guess, does the guidance assume that there's still going to be some pressure there and that you won't be fully merchandised for the holidays? Or are we -- are you in a position where you can be more fully sort of supplied and merchandised at the holidays in the U.S.?\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Bryan, I think that since your question is addressing more of the U.S., I will pass it to Carlos.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Miguel. I think, first of all, thank you for your question. The reality is that we have continued to improve our production and our service levels as you saw in the presentation. And now that we are approaching kind of the low 90s in terms of service in Q2, they're going to allow to continue to focus on driving the right kind of levels of both service and inventory with our retailers. So, for us, it's important to see the continued progression that we have, and we don't anticipate that to actually going against us as we go forward. In fact, what we are going to continue to see as we go into Q3 and Q4 is the continued expansion of our service. And as a result, the continued improvement in terms of our performance. We saw that in Q2, where in fact, we have able to kind of unlock opportunities within, for example, brands like Philadelphia or Heinz Ketchup, both of which had record shares, in fact, higher share, they ever had in both of those businesses. So, I think as we go forward, we always going to continue to improve our position.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Mr. Goldman, your line is open.\nKen Goldman: Hi, everybody. Thank you. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you have the optionality now to execute more, I think, called it mutually strategic programs with retailers. Now that your service levels are in a better place, I just wanted to clarify, number one, is there any major difference between a mutually strategic program and just a really good promotion? That's more than just a discount. Maybe it's just something more in depth or creative than a usual promotion. I just wanted to kind of clarify that definition. And then, the second part of that is I wanted to ask if you're confident that these programs, if you do implement them, that they're being driven from a position of strength, right? Whereby you're doing them because you're able to versus maybe from a position where you're doing it, because the consumer in a position of weakness themselves is demanding it. Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Ken, I'll give you two examples of these programs that, because we have now much better service levels we can have. So, I'll give you two examples. One is what we call the Art of the Burger, has been a very successful program, especially now during summertime when people barbecue more. And when we can put together our sauces, our teas, together with the bonds of supermarket chains, it has been very good and very well accepted by our customers. I'll give you another example in a moment like this, that we are exploring value propositions, with together -- with customers, I'll give you example of grilled cheese. You can have a grilled cheese for less than $1. And we do programs with our customers putting together our cheese, our mayo, and with their brand as well, right? So, these are just two examples of bringing value, the value proposition, and the customers are receiving. This is extremely well. And this is bringing a little bit of creativity that had never used thinking about value or bringing the value of our products to life together with the customers.\nKen Goldman: And then the second part -- thank you for that. The second, doing this, I guess, from a position where you feel it's from strength rather than -- maybe because the consumer is demanding it a little bit. I just wanted to make sure about that. And I -- maybe you answered that a little bit with the second part of that, talking about the value proposition promos, but just curious for your thoughts there.\nMiguel Patricio: I'm not -- the other thing I would say here, Ken, is on stickiness we continue to have very productive conversations with our customers in a way that makes sense for both of us. But \u2026\nKen Goldman: Great.\nMiguel Patricio: We feel very positive about it. We are excited with the momentum that we have with our customers and with our consumers.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. And Mr. Lazar, your line is open.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks very much. In the slide deck, you provided a breakdown of categories that are sort of more and less sensitive to price gaps with private label. I think 15% of sales are in categories that are more sensitive where gaps are increasing. And I'm just curious, how do you approach these businesses in terms of balancing share and profitability? Do you take the necessary price to protect profit and deal with the short-term pressure on share or protect share and sort of take the short-term profit hit? And you talk about another 25% that are sensitive to private label gaps, but currently stable. And I guess, if those were to expand from here, I guess what gives you confidence you can manage this bigger segment in the context of your sort of growth algorithm? Thanks so much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, let me start this, I think, Andrew, the question specifically to the U.S., so I'll take a shot. I think for us the reality is that even as we think about those businesses, there may be, as you saw, a very small part of our portfolio is just more exposed to private label. One of the things that we\u2019re actually doing is working differently in terms of how we offering consumer solutions in a moment in which they're looking for different choices across the spectrum of economic development of consumers. So, one of the things we're actually looking at is how we actually allow consumers to stay in our iconic brands because of the number of ranges of our products across our pricing ladder, whether that is -- and let me give you an example, something like Oscar Mayer in which we have from natural to deli fresh to regional Oscar Mayer, that allows consumers actually for, to have an option in which to actually stay within our brands. Knowing that over the last couple of years, we've actually been renovating many of our iconic brands and investing behind it. So, we have improved the quality. We have improved the renovation of those brands in a way now that makes our brands even more valuable to consumers. And frankly, we're seeing that already play out. We see that, for example, you have a product like Kraft Mac & Cheese portfolio in which we also have that kind of full array of products across pricing ladder that in Q2 you saw us gaining share as well. So, for us, it's about being strategic about how we think about leveraging the entire portfolio that we have in a way that allows us to continue to offer consumers different approaches in terms of options.\nMiguel Patricio: And it's really category-by-category, right? So, even in the 15% where the prices are expanding, the stories are very different. Like instead cheese, similar to cold cuts, we do have a very good price ladder. We have the VELVEETA license and the floor effects even priced at or below private label. We have the Kraft Singles and we have the Deluxe. And we're actually gaining share, so in the last several months, so it's working quite well for us. In Ore-Ida, for example, we have the partnership with Simplot that is now starting and that to unlock a lot of capacity later in the year, which will allow us to start to promote more of these brands, which we haven't been able to do in a consistent manner for years. So, it's really category-by-category. We monitor this very close and makes sense that -- we are doing something that makes sense for both top and bottom line.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Growe from Stifel. And your line is now open. Mr. Growe, please make sure your line is not on mute.\nChris Growe: Can you hear me now?\nOperator: Yes, sir.\nChris Growe: Thank you. I just had a quick question for you, if I could, around the revenue growth in the quarter outpacing consumption. I was just curious how much of that was Foodservice strength, for example, and maybe the non-measured channels versus actual inventory rebuilding. I think this kind of fits with an earlier question around, do you see product availability as a constraint for the third and fourth quarter performance in the second half, or is that behind us now is what I'm ultimately trying to get to? Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: I think it's a combination of these factors. So, Foodservice, as you have seen in our presentation, is growing north of 20%. So -- and that represents roughly 30% of our total revenue. In non-measured channels in the U.S., we have been doing very well in club and dollar, actually been gaining share we are to date in those two channels, because we are already prepared for a gradual shift toward those channels. And we have been guiding what month announced in Q1, in fact, in Q2 was very minor. So, I think it's not attributed for the first two. Regarding service levels, as you have seen, we are still in the low 90s, where the ideal level is in the high 90s. So, we still have virtual. Obviously, it's got the average of the portfolio in. Some categories are in great shape, back to the historical appropriate levels of services, some others still working through it. And even to look on shelf availability, we are much closer to the historical levels. So, if you think about shelf availability, I think you are going to see the industry like 93, 94. We are now in the 91, 92. So, we're getting there. There's still some room to grow.\nChris Growe: And would there still be some continued inventory build you'd expect at retail as you improve your service levels?\nAndre Maciel: We might. Obviously, we cannot comment on how -- we don't know how we're going to measure the inventories moving forward. If you were to look capacity historical levels, yes, there could be some room for further inventory buildup.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Powers, your line is now open.\nStephen Powers: Yes. Hey. Good morning. Good morning. Thanks. You talked about your outlook contemplating greater price elasticity negatively impacting volume and mix, I guess, over the balance of the year. Is there a way for you to help us think through the P&L impacts of lower volumes at this point? Clearly, there are many other moving parts. But all else equal, if volumes are to move lower in places where you anticipate, how material is that on margins in terms of fixed cost deleverage per unit sold? I'm just -- I'm really asking just how fixed versus variable the cost structure is at this point.\nAndre Maciel: Thanks for the question. At this point, it is not really a drag because we are still building inventory. Remember, our services in the low 90s. So, as we continue to produce more than what we sell, it actually is a little positive effect at this moment. And we are monitoring the demand curves very closely. So, then, we'll also adjust our labor accordingly to make sure that we don't have an overhang down the road when we start to step down on production to make sure that we don't have more labor than needed and have this effect that you're talking about. But as of right now, this is not an issue.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I could, you gave some good color on the cost outlook for the remainder of 2022. I guess, I'm just curious how you see, if possible, early positioning looking out to 2023. I guess, on the one hand, you mentioned costs hopefully peaking and maybe starting to receive in some cases. But on the other hand, we're still obviously a lot higher year-over-year. And you presumably have some hedges rolling into the year that will roll-off both on commodities and currency. So, just maybe a little bit of color, if you have any, on early positioning, visibility on constant currency looking out to the first part of 2023.\nMiguel Patricio: There\u2019s still a lot of volatility out there. Yes. The costs have received it. They are still very high. We are working with different senates for next year, but I need to talk about that. See that we have been taken like price throughout the year that we wanted to have a carryover effect into next year, especially in the first half of the year. So that will help, but early to tell.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. Your income statement shows losses on your derivative hedges in 2Q. I imagine that commodity inputs are now falling. And if that's right, should we assume at some point that this necessitates more counts in your existing on any specific products? And then a quick follow-up.\nAndre Maciel: Yeah. So, thanks for the question. So, a couple of things. First, maybe to answer the prior question you need little bit to this one. We typically price on what -- on market changes, not on our hedges position, right? So, that's important you know that. Hope this is clear. We price based on what we're seeing out in the market, not based on what our internal pricing hedgings are. But the second thing is regarding this effect, what you see in the P&L is the change in the unrealized hedge on commodities, okay? So, it doesn't mean that the hedge is positive or negative. It just made that there was a change period over period. So, we're still having hedge gains. We had hedge gains in both Q1 and Q2. But because part of that materialized, we see this negative effect on the realized portion. But again, what is important thing is we look at the market prices and that's how we make our price decisions.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Maybe I'll follow-up. My follow-up is, I think you did shift above [technical difficulty] consumption in 2Q. And I think you said that you'd be refilling shelves in 2Q. Can you give us any number as to how much that might be just in 2Q?\nAndre Maciel: The inventory effect in Q2 is very small. So, yeah, the 2Q is a very small number. And again, we don't know how retailers are going to manage their inventories. If you were to look at the levels pre-pandemic, net-net, we still have room to grow our inventory retailers. And our shop availability, as I said before, it is still a little below the historical level, which might give further indication that this is a possibility.\nRobert Moskow: Yeah. Andre, I get it. But you also said you're producing above your sales. So, I don't know, is it a material amount? Or are you just -- it is. And are you refilling your own inventory then rather than retailers or?\nAndre Maciel: We are now refilling our own inventory because we think -- the historical levels. And eventually, this will go to the retailers. I don't know, Carlos, do you want to add something else?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. I mean, I would say if you look at the presentation and the fact that we are able to provide service from the low 80s to the low 90s, it's a result of us being able to actually leverage our entire supply chain in a way that now with right inventory levels in many of our categories that we can provide that service. At the same time, as Andre said, we're still in the low 90s. So, there is opportunity for us to continue to drive that to the high 90s by pushing the right level of inventories internally, so that we can actually be able to better service our customers.\nRobert Moskow: Thanks. Thank you for the clarification.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Alexia Howard from Alliance Bernstein. Alexia, your line is open.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMiguel Patricio: Good morning, Alexia.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask about the comments you made in your prepared remarks about the International Zone and the expansion of distribution points? It seems as though in the go-to-market areas, there's been a very material expansion of distribution points in some of those emerging markets. How do you ensure that you've got the critical mass in those new outlets to make money? I don't know whether you can give us data on how profitable you are in some of those regions. But we've seen some other companies kind of dig themselves a profit hole as they're trying to do that expansion. And I just want to find out how you're making sure that you have got guardrails on that expansion. Thank you very much and I will pass it on.\nMiguel Patricio: Carlos, your view?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. No, Alexia, thanks for the question. I mean, to be honest with you, we are extremely proud and happy with what's happening with our go-to-market model, because it's a very comprehensive model that we actually start by analyzing. It starts by where we can make money. So, it starts by looking at the gross profit of each individual either channel or submarket, let's say, traditional modern trade, I mean, depending on the region in multiple countries like you -- as you just mentioned. If you pick up Brazil where we started, Russia, China, they are very vast countries so they have the profitability that you can achieve in different regions and different channels is significant -- can be significantly different. So, we start by analyzing that, flowing through all the way to how we're going to execute the store. So, it's a very comprehensive model of very detailed analytics with execution. So, as you saw and you alluded to on the slides, we started this model in 2018 in Brazil, copied, adapted and copied to Russia, and then to China. And now we are scaling up to -- by the end of the year, we expect to have 75% of our markets into this go-to-market model. And the numbers -- the result speaks for itself. So, everywhere that we implemented the model, the growth has been significantly above the other emerging markets that are also growing. So, we will continue to roll that out. It's a model that, again, requires a lot of analytics to be profitable, but at the same time, a lot of discipline on execution to kind of keep expanding in those regions that still have a lot of distribution to begin.\nAlexia Howard: Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: On the profitability side, which is obviously very important, right? We don't want to make sure that we don't put a lot of people out there and we cannot have a payback on that. We're also very disciplined on it, right? So, to give an example, in Brazil, we have about, I don't know, 1 million points of sales that we could hypothetically serve. We are still in the 100,000, 130,000 and 140,000. So -- and part of that is because the limits of our scale, right? So, that's very important.  We are halfway exploring alternatives, potential partnership should actually increase the penetration in some markets. So, maybe there will be more to come in the future. But yes, profitability is also an important consideration.\nMiguel Patricio: Since we are talking about Brazil, I think that -- now with the acquisition of Hemmer that is very strong in the South and Heinz is very strong in the Southeast, this gives us even a bigger opportunity to expand our distribution and the strength of our brands. We are really now with great scale in Brazil that we are very happy with how this acquisition is going and the plans that we have in place for the business there.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our last question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. In your prepared remarks about gross margins, you talked about the fact that you're protecting profit dollars and not margin and that was causing 450 basis points of decline and that math makes sense. But I'm sure there's more going on underneath the surface with regard to gross margins. Supply chain, I'm sure was a friction cost and maybe there's some timing with regard to pricing versus input. So, anything that you would call out that was also a factor in gross margins that we can be thinking about even into 2023 as a comparison?\nAndre Maciel: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, this is by very far the highest impact. But other than the need that you have the growth efficiency. Remember that you have the $2 billion that [indiscernible] have communicated and that we are on track to deliver. We delivered the first two years in line with the expectation. And year three, which is now -- we continue to be on track. So, that certainly continues. Mix effect is relatively small. It's now in the quarter, slightly positive as we continue to accelerate the growth platforms where we have higher margins. But the number in the quarter is not significant. So, really in this quarter, it's about the dilutive effect. But again, moving forward, we should expect to continue to deliver the growth efficiencies. And as we continue to price inflation, the inflation events that start to ease, that might put us in a better position for us to continue to recover the margin.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks for that. And then, on Foodservice, the -- very impressive growth there. The over 20% growth in North America does imply something's happening there, some big market share wins. What's driving that? And is that sustainable? And I guess, you're just citing that the big global QSRs as the momentum driver for international, and that does sound sustainable in your view?\nAndre Maciel: Thanks for the question. I think there are two things. One is, I want to highlight that was not in the prepared remarks that our Foodservice now in Q2 is 14% higher than Q2, 2019, which is really remarkable. There is a component of price, right? We've been pricing that channel consistent to what we've been doing in retail. So, price also has a lot to do with the growth that that we're seeing in Q2. But the volume continues to grow as we expand distribution. We have been getting market share in the -- where we have the information in developed markets in North America, Europe and Central. Regarding QSR, our strategies, I'll let Rafa talk a little bit to what we are doing on the International Zone.\nMiguel Patricio: Before Rafa talks about International Zone, I just want to say that since you, Andre, compared with 2019, in 2019, Foodservice was -- it's a very transactional area for the company, was not really strategic. And it was a small part of the company that we didn't put a lot of attention. I think we have a great team today with a lot of ambition and really looking at this channel as a critical strategic channel that generates penetration of our brands across the globe. If we're having great momentum in emerging markets in part is because our consumers are getting in touch with our brands in Foodservice. And so that's a very different change in mindset. And as a consequence, the team changed, yeah, I think entirely since 2019. Rafael, please?\nRafael Oliveira: Yeah. The only thing I would complement, I mean, to build on what Miguel said, we have a say here we use the model we define for Foodservice. We call -- we own the chef, own the kitchen, own the customer. And that reflects the investments we made on chefs, because chefs are extremely important, especially on QSR, global QSRs, as you alluded, because that's how you develop recipes or LTO, limited-time offers, with those customers. And this is the door into developing -- into innovating products for them to put in their stores. So, we've invested on this capability, and this is paying off peak time, because then you develop a relationship with those customers. That takes you to a different level, that allows you to innovate, to price better to get out of commodity competition. And with that, we continue to use the channel as well to build the brand, I mean, in terms of impressions, a fantastic channel to build brand impressions. So, Foodservice is a core pillar for our growth both across International, but in the U.S. as well. And Carlos can complement that. But we've been very successful with this model of investing in chefs and parting with the customers on product development.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. I would say, Rafa, the only thing I would add here is just the fact that the model that we have, we're also looking at it at a global basis. So, the same concept of us being able to kind of -- as Miguel and Rafa pointed out, leveraging our points of distribution in away from home in order for us to kind of build our iconic brands in retail. That type of virtuous cycle is something we're going to continue and we see that paying up for us. At the same time, over the last couple of years, not only have we reorganized ourselves and focused our team in being -- having kind of the right expertise and capabilities with Foodservice, but we have also simplified our portfolio quite a bit. I can tell you that since the last two years, we have reduced the number of SKUs in the U.S. Foodservice by app. So that allows us to actually pivot to the things that really matter to our customers in a way that they can help with both in terms of providing the great service and great value in away from home. And with that, let me pass it over to Miguel for some closing remarks.\nMiguel Patricio: Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions today. As you are seeing, we are a company in the midst of a transformation. We are proud of what we've done so far, very proud, but each day, we continue to improve and to evolve, and we are just getting started. We have so many opportunities ahead of us, and we are all very excited about what's to come. Thank you very much, and thank you for the continued interest in Kraft Heinz.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Well, thank you, Anne-Marie and thank you everyone for joining us today. I wanted to acknowledge the fact that we are living under a lot of uncertainty in what regards the external world. And in that sense, I want to thank my team and to congratulate my team for delivering another quarter of very solid results. Although, we are mindful of the current inflationary environment and how it affects our consumers and our customers, but we continue to develop solutions that benefit our consumers and our retailers. Our relationships with retailers continue to strengthen, and we have improved inventory and service levels, so we can have now more optionality to execute more mutually strategic programs. Well, with that, we are happy to take your questions. Okay. Bryan, I think that since your question is addressing more of the U.S., I will pass it to Carlos. Okay.

            "content": "Good morning, Bryan. Thanks for the question. Very good, by the way. So, yes, you are right. So, this is the GAAP gross margin. So, to get adjusted, we need to increase this number by 110 basis points due to the change of realized hedge on commodities. Okay. And in fact, if we adjust for that, our margin in Q2 is pretty much in line with the margin in Q1. And if you compare to prior year, you would see an expansion of margin if were not for the dilutive impact of repricing to offset inflation. I think it's a combination of these factors. So, Foodservice, as you have seen in our presentation, is growing north of 20%. So -- and that represents roughly 30% of our total revenue.

But as of right now, this is not an issue. Yeah. So, thanks for the question. So, a couple of things. First, maybe to answer the prior question you need little bit to this one. We typically price on what -- on market changes, not on our hedges position, right? So, that's important you know that. Hope this is clear. We price based on what we're seeing out in the market, not based on what our internal pricing hedgings are. But the second thing is regarding this effect, what you see in the P&L is the change in the unrealized hedge on commodities, okay? So, it doesn't mean that the hedge is positive or negative. It just made that there was a change period over period. So, we're still having hedge gains. We had hedge gains in both Q1 and Q2. But because part of that materialized, we see this negative effect on the realized portion. But again, what is important thing is we look at the market prices and that's how we make our price decisions. The inventory effect in Q2 is very small. So, yeah, the 2Q is a very small number. And again, we don't know how retailers are going to manage their inventories. If you were to look at the levels pre-pandemic, net-net, we still have room to grow our inventory retailers. And our shop availability, as I said before, it is still a little below the historical level, which might give further indication that this is a possibility. We are now refilling our own inventory because we think -- the historical levels. And eventually, this will go to the retailers. I don't know, Carlos, do you want to add something else? On the profitability side, which is obviously very important, right? We don't want to make sure that we don't put a lot of people out there and we cannot have a payback on that. We're also very disciplined on it, right? So, to give an example, in Brazil, we have about, I don't know, 1 million points of sales that we could hypothetically serve. We are still in the 100,000, 130,000 and 140,000. So -- and part of that is because the limits of our scale, right? So, that's very important.  We are halfway exploring alternatives, potential partnership should actually increase the penetration in some markets. So, maybe there will be more to come in the future. But yes, profitability is also an important consideration. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Look, this is by very far the highest impact. But other than the need that you have the growth efficiency. Remember that you have the $2 billion that [indiscernible] have communicated and that we are on track to deliver. We delivered the first two years in line with the expectation. And year three, which is now -- we continue to be on track. So, that certainly continues. Mix effect is relatively small. It's now in the quarter, slightly positive as we continue to accelerate the growth platforms where we have higher margins. But the number in the quarter is not significant. So, really in this quarter, it's about the dilutive effect. But again, moving forward, we should expect to continue to deliver the growth efficiencies. And as we continue to price inflation, the inflation events that start to ease, that might put us in a better position for us to continue to recover the margin. Thanks for the question. I think there are two things. One is, I want to highlight that was not in the prepared remarks that our Foodservice now in Q2 is 14% higher than Q2, 2019, which is really remarkable. There is a component of price, right? We've been pricing that channel consistent to what we've been doing in retail. So, price also has a lot to do with the growth that that we're seeing in Q2. But the volume continues to grow as we expand distribution. We have been getting market share in the -- where we have the information in developed markets in North America, Europe and Central. Regarding QSR, our strategies, I'll let Rafa talk a little bit to what we are doing on the International Zone."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Thank you, Miguel. I think, first of all, thank you for your question. The reality is that we have continued to improve our production and our service levels as you saw in the presentation. And now that we are approaching kind of the low 90s in terms of service in Q2, they're going to allow to continue to focus on driving the right kind of levels of both service and inventory with our retailers. So, for us, it's important to see the continued progression that we have, and we don't anticipate that to actually going against us as we go forward. In fact, what we are going to continue to see as we go into Q3 and Q4 is the continued expansion of our service. And as a result, the continued improvement in terms of our performance. We saw that in Q2, where in fact, we have able to kind of unlock opportunities within, for example, brands like Philadelphia or Heinz Ketchup, both of which had record shares, in fact, higher share, they ever had in both of those businesses. So, I think as we go forward, we always going to continue to improve our position. Well, let me start this, I think, Andrew, the question specifically to the U.S., so I'll take a shot. I think for us the reality is that even as we think about those businesses, there may be, as you saw, a very small part of our portfolio is just more exposed to private label. One of the things that we're actually doing is working differently in terms of how we offering consumer solutions in a moment in which they're looking for different choices across the spectrum of economic development of consumers. So, one of the things we're actually looking at is how we actually allow consumers to stay in our iconic brands because of the number of ranges of our products across our pricing ladder, whether that is -- and let me give you an example, something like Oscar Mayer in which we have from natural to deli fresh to regional Oscar Mayer, that allows consumers actually for, to have an option in which to actually stay within our brands. Knowing that over the last couple of years, we've actually been renovating many of our iconic brands and investing behind it. So, we have improved the quality. We have improved the renovation of those brands in a way now that makes our brands even more valuable to consumers. And frankly, we're seeing that already play out. We see that, for example, you have a product like Kraft Mac & Cheese portfolio in which we also have that kind of full array of products across pricing ladder that in Q2 you saw us gaining share as well. So, for us, it's about being strategic about how we think about leveraging the entire portfolio that we have in a way that allows us to continue to offer consumers different approaches in terms of options. Yeah. I mean, I would say if you look at the presentation and the fact that we are able to provide service from the low 80s to the low 90s, it's a result of us being able to actually leverage our entire supply chain in a way that now with right inventory levels in many of our categories that we can provide that service. At the same time, as Andre said, we're still in the low 90s. So, there is opportunity for us to continue to drive that to the high 90s by pushing the right level of inventories internally, so that we can actually be able to better service our customers. Yeah. No, Alexia, thanks for the question. I mean, to be honest with you, we are extremely proud and happy with what's happening with our go-to-market model, because it's a very comprehensive model that we actually start by analyzing. It starts by where we can make money. So, it starts by looking at the gross profit of each individual either channel or submarket, let's say, traditional modern trade, I mean, depending on the region in multiple countries like you -- as you just mentioned. If you pick up Brazil where we started, Russia, China, they are very vast countries so they have the profitability that you can achieve in different regions and different channels is significant -- can be significantly different. So, we start by analyzing that, flowing through all the way to how we're going to execute the store. So, it's a very comprehensive model of very detailed analytics with execution. So, as you saw and you alluded to on the slides, we started this model in 2018 in Brazil, copied, adapted and copied to Russia, and then to China. And now we are scaling up to -- by the end of the year, we expect to have 75% of our markets into this go-to-market model. And the numbers -- the result speaks for itself. So, everywhere that we implemented the model, the growth has been significantly above the other emerging markets that are also growing. So, we will continue to roll that out. It's a model that, again, requires a lot of analytics to be profitable, but at the same time, a lot of discipline on execution to kind of keep expanding in those regions that still have a lot of distribution to begin. Yeah. I would say, Rafa, the only thing I would add here is just the fact that the model that we have, we're also looking at it at a global basis. So, the same concept of us being able to kind of -- as Miguel and Rafa pointed out, leveraging our points of distribution in away from home in order for us to kind of build our iconic brands in retail. That type of virtuous cycle is something we're going to continue and we see that paying up for us. At the same time, over the last couple of years, not only have we reorganized ourselves and focused our team in being -- having kind of the right expertise and capabilities with Foodservice, but we have also simplified our portfolio quite a bit. I can tell you that since the last two years, we have reduced the number of SKUs in the U.S. Foodservice by app. So that allows us to actually pivot to the things that really matter to our customers in a way that they can help with both in terms of providing the great service and great value in away from home. And with that, let me pass it over to Miguel for some closing remarks."

I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Chris Jakubik. You may begin.\nChris Jakubik: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Chris Jakubik, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2022 business update. During our remarks today, we will make some forward-looking statements that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ due to risks and uncertainties, and they are discussed in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. We will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures today during the call, and these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with GAAP results. And you can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and the supplemental materials posted at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for a few quick opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you, Chris. I would just like to start by sharing how proud I am of our people, and the truly transformational work they continue to deliver for our company. We've seen 2 years of a lot of disruption, and they continue to successfully address the short-term challenges, at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage of our company and our brands. Our teams delivered a strong start for the year, both on top line and bottom line. We remain on strategy with the strongest growth coming from our priority platforms, brands, channels and markets. We are effectively managing our inflation, improving our supply constraints, while continuing to gain incremental efficiencies. We continue to make progress, building and deploying initiatives to accelerate our advantages in areas like becoming more agile, becoming much more creative in marketing, developing joint business plans between retail and foodservice and capacity unlocks in our Grow and Energize platforms. As you are now seeing, we are doing this through strategic partnerships with technology clients and cutting-edge innovators to accelerate our transformation and redefine best-in-class across our value chain. It is a very exciting time for Kraft Heinz and I don't think we could be better equipped to build on our momentum through what promises to remain a very challenging environment. With that, well, let's take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Chris, congratulations to you. Thank you for all the help over the -- well, too many years to quantify. I appreciate it. My question really is around retail inventory. I guess, where are you currently regarding the retail inventory rebuild versus where you want to be? And how much more opportunity might there be for shipments to exceed consumption going forward related to this dynamic, which I guess, could be somewhat of an offset, should elasticity ramp up a bit from here? And is there any indication that retailers may opt to hold more inventory going forward than they did pre-pandemic, having seen during the past 2 years how problematic out of stocks can be when there are supply dislocations?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Andrew, this is Carlos. Let me take that one first and also, let me just echo Miguel's comment. I'm just so proud of how our teams have managed through all this and the strong start of the year is a testament to the resiliency of the teams. Now, to your questions about retail inventories, they do remain fluid. If you recall, we exited last year below normal days of inventory from a historical perspective that were both in terms of the trade and in our warehouse. And if you look at in Q1, our actual production volume was actually 10% higher than it was a year ago, and we expect that to continue through the year-end, so that we can support the inventory recovery. And in Q1, the way it looks is that we began to rebuild some of the retail inventories in certain categories. But in aggregate, we're still below historical levels. And our expectations as we continue through the year is that we'll recover our inventory levels by the end of the year, with service levels than returning to pre-pandemic levels early next year. Now, let me tell you kind of our focus going forward is going to be in 3 specific areas. One is recovering the service constrained category and focus on the key power SKUs, and as you saw, our increasing production level supports this initiative. Number 2 is improving the share of shelf and implement shelving principles. We have both detailed plans to do that and a strong collaboration with customers to do just this. And finally, creating in-store destination so that we can launch meaningful incremental interruptive innovation into the marketplace. And you are seeing this already from our award-winning Art of the Burger to creating deepen destinations and breakfast destination in-store and online that leverage our scale in partnership with retailers. Now, you asked specifically about kind of how to also think about the retailers and their inventory normalized. I would say, it's difficult to say where exactly the retail inventory level will normalize. The one thing I will kind of make you think about it is the fact that if you keep in mind that pre-pandemic levels, the inventory levels actually saw quite a bit of inventory reduction in the 2- to 3-year period prior to the pandemic. So I would say it's hard to predict, but we know that as we continue to move forward, we're building that because there's still room for us to do that. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you. Interesting comments in those prepared remarks about the partnerships with Microsoft and Google. Maybe, if you can touch on those a bit more and what outcomes do you expect from those? What areas of improvement do you expect us to see, and what's first?\nMiguel Patricio: Carlos, do you want to answer that question, please?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure. So let me just say that part of the partnership that we're doing is really, is about supporting our AGILE@SCALEs initiatives. And for us, if you recall, when we talked in CAGNY, we talked about how AGILE@SCALE was going to help us in 3 ways. First, it was about us making sure we organize and embed and lead with agile values throughout the company. And we mentioned how we actually evolve our structure to be flatter and leaner, with multidisciplinary teams and missions to attack the largest priority. And in North America, we actually instituted a rule of 5, where only 5 levels between myself and the interposition in the business units. The second part of that, and to your question, is also that we were building a tech ecosystem to create end-to-end capabilities with leading tech companies to accelerate our solutions, to capture efficiencies and create a significant competitive advantage. What you're seeing in our partnership between whether it's in Microsoft, whether it is in a partnership with Google, it also allows them to look for those partnerships that allow us to accelerate and move to an agile scale. Because then, once we build up tech ecosystem, we can then scale up to leverage the proven solutions across -- and maximize the value creation. The reality is that we're also doing this across the entire value chain. I'm very pleased with the partnership we have with Microsoft because it's going to allow us to also look at things like areas and planning, in manufacturing, in logistics and sales and marketing that allows us to get closer to our consumer and making sure we actually are getting real-time information that we improve the customer service by improving forecast accuracy and speed, and that it generates end-to-end efficiencies with new processes, tools and structure. So as you will see, we are going to continue to look for those partnerships in which we can actually work together to accelerate our journey towards AGILE@SCALE.\nMiguel Patricio: I would just like to add to what Carlos just said that these partnerships go beyond just technology. So as you remember, we announced, before the NotCo and the Simplot partnerships, these are other great examples of us to become more agile in all areas of the company. We didn't have a good pipeline of plant-based products and would take a lot of time to develop. Well, partner with a company that can bring you solutions in a record time and great quality. We didn't have a solution for our line business from a supply standpoint, well, partner with the ones that can solve quality, innovation and volume problems that we would eventually have moving forward. We'll -- these are just great examples of partnerships that will just make us more agile and faster.\nDavid Palmer : And just on the marketing side or the actual spending side, what is your advertising as a percent of sales today in big picture? How has that shifted in terms of the percent of sales over the last few years? But also, how -- or have you shifted that spending? I would imagine, digital is a much higher percent today and give us a flavor of what you're anticipating there?\nMiguel Patricio: I can\u2019t give you a better sense of the percentage of net sales, because with all these changes we are having net sales, I don't want to give you a number that is not precise. But let me tell you that it's not our intention to reduce the investments in marketing. This year will either be flat or growing, depending on how the year continues, because we want to continue investing in our brands. Our investment in digital today is about 2/3 of all our investment, about 70% of our investment. But I would say that more than even the quantity at this moment, I'm really, really impressed with the quality and how we changed the way to communicate. Today, we have, in all our views, our own development of digital marketing that gives us really the possibility of being at the speed of culture and producing from a day to another one, great quality marketing that makes us much more engaging. It is very different, the quality of marketing that we have nowadays. I don't know if you saw, but Advertising Age selected us as the best campaign of the year. It put us among the 5 best marketers in North America, and more recently, they called VELVEETA the best renovation or the best rebranding of the year. And these are all consequences of huge improvement of the quality of our marketing.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The one thing I guess I would be also to Miguel's comment is that while it's true that we have invested in about $100 million more in marketing to 2019, our focus really has changed and is what Miguel just highlighted, we are focused very much into earned media and which actually we have seen how we have proven that increases the return on that investment. So for us is, how do we make sure that all the personalization and improved creativity that our teams are showing translating us creating more impactful campaigns that generate the earn media that improves the ROI. So it's not just the investment we make, but the amplifying effect of our investment because of the quality of the work that we're putting out. And that's why we continue on this journey. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I guess I wanted to ask about commodities and raw materials and not so much on cost, but just availability. Given some of the supply chain issues, I guess, that have been caused by the war in the Ukraine and some of the agricultural commodities potentially being short supply. Just -- is that a concern on your end in terms of just availability of raw materials? Have you seen it at all crop up, maybe, competitively like, smaller competitors having service issues? And then maybe, if I could just tie to that as well, given that you do have some exposure to it, just bird flu, is that something we should be worried about, given that you do grow some turkeys?\nAndre Maciel: Thanks for the question. I'll get this one. Andre here. So yes, situations come up every day on the raw material and packaging materials side. So the situation continues to be challenging. And I think the teams have been out for 2 years dealing with these challenges on a recurring basis, right? It requires a lot of resilience from our team, which have been demonstrating very strongly. Now, the great thing is, despite all these challenges, we have been able, throughout the quarter, to rebuild inventories for the first time from ever since the pandemic level, and we have improved service levels. And I think we are now in a good trajectory to continue to do so into the second quarter. So despite the challenges that we continue to face in the whole market, we have been able to navigate through that. I think our scale also definitely helps on this regard. Regarding hedging, as we said before, we have been maintaining a very disciplined approach for hedging. So we haven't been speculating or trying to second guess, what's going to happen in the market. I have been maintaining our strategy to maintain a consistency. And as we mentioned, some of the commodities have been the most impacted by the Ukraine conflict, like grains, oils, energy, we are hedged on those until Q4, which put us also in a good position.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: But Bryan, the point about availability has been around for a long time now, before the war. Every day, there's one raw material that is short because the supply chain is very tight, overall. I think that in that sense, company with our scale should be able to navigate better. And there are examples every day. I mean, there's a shortage -- just as an example of Bingham, which is raw material to do cream cheese, and we have a good inventory of that. So the smaller companies will have difficulty to have access to that business. And every day, we really have to adapt every day to a new problem. I think the teams have done a great job in that sense.\nBryan Spillane: And then if you could touch just on bird flu, is that a concern at all?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Let me touch on that then. I think first, let me give you a little bit of historical context. I mean, we have seen this before. And one thing that is different about this time around, is that we have the insight from the lessons we learned last time. As we looked at it this time around, we are flexing our portfolio to address the short-term kind of poultry disruptions. We've had some experience doing this in the past 2 years on how we actually flexed our portfolio, so we can actually be very dynamic in our response. The regions from which we buy Turkey have not been impacted so far. Now, we have seen price increases, that is true. So what we're using is our strategic sourcing network that Miguel spoke about to provide those supply and will remain agile as we go forward. And we're working closely with our retail partners so that we can navigate as the situation evolves. But again, I think we have seen that we have learned in the past, we're applying those lessons, and reality is that we're flexing our portfolio in order to navigate through this.\nRafael Oliveira: Bryan, Rafa here. Just to compliment to you, you asked about exposure to Ukraine. For us, it's negligible, it's very small, okay, the exposure to raw materials in Ukraine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. To echo the earlier sentiment, congrats, Chris. Your legend will miss you. And Marie, congrats on the escalation. Looking forward to working with you more closely going forward. To the questions I have, great to see your foodservice momentum. I think you gave 2 statistics, the growth in U.S. and growth internationally. Can you give us the blended growth rate like across all of foodservice, 12% of sales growing, what on average? And how close are you to back to pre-pandemic levels? Have we pretty much closed the gap? Is that what's driving the majority of the growth? Or is this momentum over and above the recovery from COVID?\nAndre Maciel: Okay. So look, I'm not going to quote specific numbers, but both -- across international zone in North America, we are growing north of 20% on both, okay? And gaining share, as also indicated across the board, which put us in a very good position. And the way things are trending so far, it's possible that already going to be ahead of 2019 levels, the list in North America, which is also great.\nMiguel Patricio: And I would add on the comments from Andre, that we are very excited with the foodservice. We see as the different from the past, there was a very transactional channel. Today, it\u2019s a truly transactional -- sorry, a strategic channel for us. It's a great way for us to launch new products, to test them, to sample them with the consumers and then to leverage that sampling to the trade. In the presentation, you have a very recent example of that, but it's our intention to keep doing that through -- to through the future.\nJason English : For sure. Makes a lot of sense. And I appreciate the comment earlier on ad spend and the commitment to have it be flat, if not, up as a percentage of sales for the year. But can you unpack a little bit more on the SG&A efficiency this quarter? It's down pretty sharply year-on-year. Is that the efforts of your productivity? Or is there some unique timing dynamics that we should be aware of?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: On the SG&A, we have in the first quarter having a onetime gain from last year that do not get repeated. So pretty much, that's what's driving the entire impairments that you're asking.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKenGoldman: And just to echo the prior comments. Chris, thank you for all of the help, you'll truly be missed and Ann Marie, congratulations as well on the new role. I wanted to ask, you've highlighted your reduced exposure to private label in the U.S., so I don't want to suggest Kraft is at any particular risk here. I'm really just curious if you're starting to see retail customers leaning in a bit harder to their store brands recently, whether it's via incremental displays or other efforts, I guess, to try and maybe highlight for consumers some other offerings that are at lower prices. Are there any behavioral changes you're seeing from those customers?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: So let me take that. I would say, so far, what we're seeing from private label is that they're actually increasing their prices in line with the branded players. The reality is the cost escalating for everyone. And in terms of Kraft Heinz, I mean, what I'll tell you is that we are stronger today than we have been in the past in 4 specific areas. One, we actually have relatively low private label exposure. So today, we're about 11% of the portfolio exposed to private label versus 17% just a couple of years ago. And if you think about that number of 11% versus an industry average of about 20%, it certainly puts us in an advantage situation. We're also making sure that we are launching products that are differentiated at each round of the price ladder. So whether it's entry to mainstream to premium, so that consumers can stay with our franchise as their circumstances may change. Whether it's a -- in a blue box Mac & Cheese to an Easy Mac, they have something to come into and stay with our icon brands. And we also continue to improve the product design so that we can offer better value for the money and greater ingredient flexibility, less waste and lower production cost and actually, you'll see that in our marketing also as we go forward. And then finally, we're also leveraging the breadth of our portfolio across categories so that we can provide comprehensive occasion-based solutions that the whole family can enjoy. So we are in a very good place right now in terms of our exposures, and we are seeing kind of a private label being affected by the same way that we have.\nKen Goldman: And then a quick follow-up for Andre. Andre, you mentioned that as inflation plateaus, you expect to see your margin percentage rebound. I understand that futures curves are volatile, but is there an estimate you have for when you expect your gross inflation, including hedges to have peaked? Might we be a little bit closer to that than maybe, some bears you're thinking about?\nAndre Maciel: Thanks for the question. As we said before, we have been taking actions consistently to protect our margin dollars at this point. right? And we want to maintain our ability to invest in the business, as Miguel and Carlos pointed out, what is critical to us. The current percentage margin is lower than our run rate, I can tell you that, and we expect those margins to recover as costs stabilize and the price realization comes through, as re-pricing at our last batch of inflation like the whole market is. So it recovers over time. Remember as well that beyond the short term, our adjusted EBITDA margin evolution, this should remain consistent to the strategy that I have outlined before, which is to have better gross margins from variable cost efficiencies, stronger pricing mix, and that will help us to fund high investments in brands, people and capabilities. So that's what we are seeking here. So even though I cannot go to a specific time or when we are going to recover the percentage margin, that should happen over time, okay? So if you look at the pre-pandemic levels, we were in the 24% range. So\u2026\nChris Jakubik: If we can take, maybe, one more question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Moskow: Thanks for the question. And Chris, I congratulate you, and I'm jealous of you also. But I guess, my question here is, can you drill down a little bit more into -- I think the comment was that your production volume will be up 10% versus a year ago. But this is an environment where there's a lot of unknowns about elasticity. And I think a lot of your peers are expecting elasticity to really accelerate by the end of the year. So can you give me a sense as to what that 10% increase really means? And is it contingent upon what you see in the demand environment, obviously?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, thank you for your question, and I think we're all jealous of Chris, by the way. What I will tell you is that we expect an increase in elasticity going forward closer to historical levels. So prices are -- everything is on the way up, and we know that most of the stimulus is gone. Now, today, we're seeing that elasticity is running about 30% to 40% below historical levels. Now, the reason we're confident about our production is that we are also growing consumption sequentially as we rebuild retail inventory levels. So understand that we are actually making the advancements, again, many of the supply chain challenges that today, are actually holding back our market share performance. That's why as we think about the Q1 production up 10%, it is to support the rebuilding that inventory levels that have been still below our historical levels. And that we feel confident about us continues into that kind of level of support.\nAndre Maciel: And Rob, just to add to that. So to be clear, right? So the production in Q1 was 10%. It doesn't mean that we definitely go up 10%. We are just now ramping up production to rebuild the inventory levels at the retail and in our warehouses, okay? So we are not changing our inventory policy for the future. We just did to get to that level.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So if you're not saying that production is going to be up 10% throughout the year. I thought that was what the comment meant.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, it's 10% in Q1.\nRobert Moskow: Right, just Q1. Okay. Last question. If volume continues to kind of be down in this, like, 4%, 5% kind of range, I think that's what your U.S. retail volume was down. Does that do anything to your fixed cost leverage at the end of the year? Or is there just going to be so much pricing it doesn't really matter what happens to the fixed cost leverage?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Look, we -- I think that's where the inventory review discussion comes from, right, which is important. Because we are rebuilding inventories right now. So despite the volumes are being down, we still need to produce a lot to recover the inventory level. So we don't expect any relevant impact from fixed COGS in this fiscal year.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.\nChrisGrowe: Thank you. And Chris, congratulations to you. Just thinking, 68 or so earnings reports over those 17 years. So it's kind of crazy when you put it in those terms. I just want to ask a quick question, if I could, on the supply constraints to your volume. You outlined it in a chart, like a 50 basis point market share decline as a result of those factors. How much of a revenue burden was that in the quarter, if you can say that?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The pause means that it's difficult to kind of back into that right now, Chris. I think from the perspective of kind of rebuilding the inventories and then, netted against some of the supply constraints and how that translated through the shelf, in addition to the Easter shift, there's a lot of variables moving through that. So that's something we'll have to try to circle back to you.\nChris Growe: Fair enough. No problem. Go ahead.\nAndre Maciel: It's a low single-digit impact, right, to revenue. But I think that the important thing is that we said in the last call, we expect it to continue to lose market share, but we expect it to improve, and we did, right? And we did it in the places where we said we would, which is mostly coming from the places where we have like a big constraint at the end of last year. And our perspective is to continue to improve the trend moving forward as the service level recovers.\nChris Growe: Okay. And just one other quick follow-on would be in relation to pricing. You had more pricing coming through in the second quarter. When you account for that pricing along with -- you've got a lot of productivity savings as well, do you believe this pricing, along with the productivity savings would be enough to offset inflation once it's in place? Are you going to sort of be caught up now with the level of inflation based on the pricing you have currently announced?\nAndre Maciel: We expect -- We have been taking actions with the inflation that we have seen. And in the guidance that you have provided, we are already contemplating the inflation that we are seeing even in the forward curves, which, by the way, they have been increasing a little bit since the peak. So our -- as of right now, in the graphs provided to you, our price year-over-year will be ahead of inflation. Obviously, we are still catching up a little bit with the inflation that starts to rise at the end of last year, but on a year-over-year base, our price will be ahead of inflation.\nChris Growe: Okay. Okay. Thank you for that color.\nChrisJakubik: Great. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Let me turn it back to Miguel for a couple of closing remarks.\nMiguel Patricio: I opened today's call saying that it's a very exciting time to be at Kraft Heinz, and let me tell you why we think that way. First, we are very proud because we've been able to navigate through all the uncertainties over the last 2 years, at the same time that we are building a much better tomorrow. And that's not easy in moments like this. We are a very company -- in a very different company today. We are much more growth-oriented. We have improved our portfolio mix, and today, just the platforms where we are working, and we have focused, Taste Elevation is about 30% of our business today. It's big and growing, and profitable. And just to put it in perspective, it's bigger and more profitable than McCormick, just to give you an example. We have consistent double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets. Our business in foodservice is strong and growing. And we are investing more in marketing in our brands and doing a much better job, so really, the profile in terms of growth is very different. From an efficiency standpoint, I think that we are in a much better place, not only because of the $2 billion that we talked about 3 years ago, when we delivered last year and the previous year on gross savings and supply, but efficiencies across the board, I mean, from marketing to distribution and these partnerships now with technology companies that will help us accelerate these efficiencies. Finally, I think that we have a very different situation from a financial flexibility standpoint. With the discipline we had in the last 2 years, put us back in investment grade, and in a record time, just in 2 years. And going forward, we will continue generating free cash flow conversion at a rate of 100%, and we'll look to acquire business and capabilities that can be much more powerful when combined with the scale of our portfolio. All is, of course, with a lot of discipline in pricing. So that's why it's exciting to be at this moment working at Kraft Heinz. Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. You're pretty good.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Miguel Patricio",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Chris. I would just like to start by sharing how proud I am of our people, and the truly transformational work they continue to deliver for our company. We've seen 2 years of a lot of disruption, and they continue to successfully address the short-term challenges, at the same time that we are building the long-term advantage of our company and our brands. Our teams delivered a strong start for the year, both on top line and bottom line. We remain on strategy with the strongest growth coming from our priority platforms, brands, channels and markets. We are effectively managing our inflation, improving our supply constraints, while continuing to gain incremental efficiencies. We continue to make progress, building and deploying initiatives to accelerate our advantages in areas like becoming more agile, becoming much more creative in marketing, developing joint business plans between retail and foodservice and capacity unlocks in our Grow and Energize platforms. As you are now seeing, we are doing this through strategic partnerships with technology clients and cutting-edge innovators to accelerate our transformation and redefine best-in-class across our value chain. It is a very exciting time for Kraft Heinz and I don't think we could be better equipped to build on our momentum through what promises to remain a very challenging environment. With that, well, let's take your questions. Carlos, do you want to answer that question, please? I would just like to add to what Carlos just said that these partnerships go beyond just technology. So as you remember, we announced, before the NotCo and the Simplot partnerships, these are other great examples of us to become more agile in all areas of the company. We didn't have a good pipeline of plant-based products and would take a lot of time to develop. Well, partner with a company that can bring you solutions in a record time and great quality. We didn't have a solution for our line business from a supply standpoint, well, partner with the ones that can solve quality, innovation and volume problems that we would eventually have moving forward. We'll -- these are just great examples of partnerships that will just make us more agile and faster. I can't give you a better sense of the percentage of net sales, because with all these changes we are having net sales, I don't want to give you a number that is not precise. But let me tell you that it's not our intention to reduce the investments in marketing. This year will either be flat or growing, depending on how the year continues, because we want to continue investing in our brands. Our investment in digital today is about 2/3 of all our investment, about 70% of our investment. But I would say that more than even the quantity at this moment, I'm really, really impressed with the quality and how we changed the way to communicate. Today, we have, in all our views, our own development of digital marketing that gives us really the possibility of being at the speed of culture and producing from a day to another one, great quality marketing that makes us much more engaging. It is very different, the quality of marketing that we have nowadays. I don't know if you saw, but Advertising Age selected us as the best campaign of the year. It put us among the 5 best marketers in North America, and more recently, they called VELVEETA the best renovation or the best rebranding of the year. And these are all consequences of huge improvement of the quality of our marketing. And I would add on the comments from Andre, that we are very excited with the foodservice. We see as the different from the past, there was a very transactional channel. Today, it's a truly transactional -- sorry, a strategic channel for us. It's a great way for us to launch new products, to test them, to sample them with the consumers and then to leverage that sampling to the trade. In the presentation, you have a very recent example of that, but it's our intention to keep doing that through -- to through the future. I opened today's call saying that it's a very exciting time to be at Kraft Heinz, and let me tell you why we think that way. First, we are very proud because we've been able to navigate through all the uncertainties over the last 2 years, at the same time that we are building a much better tomorrow. And that's not easy in moments like this. We are a very company -- in a very different company today. We are much more growth-oriented. We have improved our portfolio mix, and today, just the platforms where we are working, and we have focused, Taste Elevation is about 30% of our business today. It's big and growing, and profitable. And just to put it in perspective, it's bigger and more profitable than McCormick, just to give you an example. We have consistent double-digit net sales growth in emerging markets.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Thanks for the question. I'll get this one. Andre here. So yes, situations come up every day on the raw material and packaging materials side. So the situation continues to be challenging. And I think the teams have been out for 2 years dealing with these challenges on a recurring basis, right? It requires a lot of resilience from our team, which have been demonstrating very strongly. Now, the great thing is, despite all these challenges, we have been able, throughout the quarter, to rebuild inventories for the first time from ever since the pandemic level, and we have improved service levels. And I think we are now in a good trajectory to continue to do so into the second quarter. So despite the challenges that we continue to face in the whole market, we have been able to navigate through that. I think our scale also definitely helps on this regard. Regarding hedging, as we said before, we have been maintaining a very disciplined approach for hedging. So we haven't been speculating or trying to second guess, what's going to happen in the market. I have been maintaining our strategy to maintain a consistency. And as we mentioned, some of the commodities have been the most impacted by the Ukraine conflict, like grains, oils, energy, we are hedged on those until Q4, which put us also in a good position. Okay. So look, I'm not going to quote specific numbers, but both -- across international zone in North America, we are growing north of 20% on both, okay? And gaining share, as also indicated across the board, which put us in a very good position. And the way things are trending so far, it's possible that already going to be ahead of 2019 levels, the list in North America, which is also great. Thanks for the question. As we said before, we have been taking actions consistently to protect our margin dollars at this point. right? And we want to maintain our ability to invest in the business, as Miguel and Carlos pointed out, what is critical to us. The current percentage margin is lower than our run rate, I can tell you that, and we expect those margins to recover as costs stabilize and the price realization comes through, as re-pricing at our last batch of inflation like the whole market is. So it recovers over time. Remember as well that beyond the short term, our adjusted EBITDA margin evolution, this should remain consistent to the strategy that I have outlined before, which is to have better gross margins from variable cost efficiencies, stronger pricing mix, and that will help us to fund high investments in brands, people and capabilities. So that's what we are seeking here. So even though I cannot go to a specific time or when we are going to recover the percentage margin, that should happen over time, okay? So if you look at the pre-pandemic levels, we were in the 24% range. So... And Rob, just to add to that. So to be clear, right? So the production in Q1 was 10%. It doesn't mean that we definitely go up 10%. We are just now ramping up production to rebuild the inventory levels at the retail and in our warehouses, okay? So we are not changing our inventory policy for the future. We just did to get to that level. It's a low single-digit impact, right, to revenue. But I think that the important thing is that we said in the last call, we expect it to continue to lose market share, but we expect it to improve, and we did, right? And we did it in the places where we said we would, which is mostly coming from the places where we have like a big constraint at the end of last year. And our perspective is to continue to improve the trend moving forward as the service level recovers. We expect -- We have been taking actions with the inflation that we have seen. And in the guidance that you have provided, we are already contemplating the inflation that we are seeing even in the forward curves, which, by the way, they have been increasing a little bit since the peak. So our -- as of right now, in the graphs provided to you, our price year-over-year will be ahead of inflation. Obviously, we are still catching up a little bit with the inflation that starts to rise at the end of last year, but on a year-over-year base, our price will be ahead of inflation. Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Chris. You're pretty good."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Andrew, this is Carlos. Let me take that one first and also, let me just echo Miguel's comment. I'm just so proud of how our teams have managed through all this and the strong start of the year is a testament to the resiliency of the teams. Now, to your questions about retail inventories, they do remain fluid. If you recall, we exited last year below normal days of inventory from a historical perspective that were both in terms of the trade and in our warehouse. And if you look at in Q1, our actual production volume was actually 10% higher than it was a year ago, and we expect that to continue through the year-end, so that we can support the inventory recovery. And in Q1, the way it looks is that we began to rebuild some of the retail inventories in certain categories. But in aggregate, we're still below historical levels. And our expectations as we continue through the year is that we'll recover our inventory levels by the end of the year, with service levels than returning to pre-pandemic levels early next year. Now, let me tell you kind of our focus going forward is going to be in 3 specific areas. One is recovering the service constrained category and focus on the key power SKUs, and as you saw, our increasing production level supports this initiative. Number 2 is improving the share of shelf and implement shelving principles. We have both detailed plans to do that and a strong collaboration with customers to do just this. And finally, creating in-store destination so that we can launch meaningful incremental interruptive innovation into the marketplace. And you are seeing this already from our award-winning Art of the Burger to creating deepen destinations and breakfast destination in-store and online that leverage our scale in partnership with retailers. Now, you asked specifically about kind of how to also think about the retailers and their inventory normalized. I would say, it's difficult to say where exactly the retail inventory level will normalize. The one thing I will kind of make you think about it is the fact that if you keep in mind that pre-pandemic levels, the inventory levels actually saw quite a bit of inventory reduction in the 2- to 3-year period prior to the pandemic. So I would say it's hard to predict, but we know that as we continue to move forward, we're building that because there's still room for us to do that. Thank you for your question. Sure. So let me just say that part of the partnership that we're doing is really, is about supporting our AGILE@SCALEs initiatives. And for us, if you recall, when we talked in CAGNY, we talked about how AGILE@SCALE was going to help us in 3 ways. First, it was about us making sure we organize and embed and lead with agile values throughout the company. And we mentioned how we actually evolve our structure to be flatter and leaner, with multidisciplinary teams and missions to attack the largest priority. And in North America, we actually instituted a rule of 5, where only 5 levels between myself and the interposition in the business units. The second part of that, and to your question, is also that we were building a tech ecosystem to create end-to-end capabilities with leading tech companies to accelerate our solutions, to capture efficiencies and create a significant competitive advantage. What you're seeing in our partnership between whether it's in Microsoft, whether it is in a partnership with Google, it also allows them to look for those partnerships that allow us to accelerate and move to an agile scale. Because then, once we build up tech ecosystem, we can then scale up to leverage the proven solutions across -- and maximize the value creation. The reality is that we're also doing this across the entire value chain. I'm very pleased with the partnership we have with Microsoft because it's going to allow us to also look at things like areas and planning, in manufacturing, in logistics and sales and marketing that allows us to get closer to our consumer and making sure we actually are getting real-time information that we improve the customer service by improving forecast accuracy and speed, and that it generates end-to-end efficiencies with new processes, tools and structure. So as you will see, we are going to continue to look for those partnerships in which we can actually work together to accelerate our journey towards AGILE@SCALE. The one thing I guess I would be also to Miguel's comment is that while it's true that we have invested in about $100 million more in marketing to 2019, our focus really has changed and is what Miguel just highlighted, we are focused very much into earned media and which actually we have seen how we have proven that increases the return on that investment. So for us is, how do we make sure that all the personalization and improved creativity that our teams are showing translating us creating more impactful campaigns that generate the earn media that improves the ROI. So it's not just the investment we make, but the amplifying effect of our investment because of the quality of the work that we're putting out. And that's why we continue on this journey. Thank you. But Bryan, the point about availability has been around for a long time now, before the war. Every day, there's one raw material that is short because the supply chain is very tight, overall. I think that in that sense, company with our scale should be able to navigate better. And there are examples every day. I mean, there's a shortage -- just as an example of Bingham, which is raw material to do cream cheese, and we have a good inventory of that. So the smaller companies will have difficulty to have access to that business. And every day, we really have to adapt every day to a new problem. I think the teams have done a great job in that sense. Yes. Let me touch on that then. I think first, let me give you a little bit of historical context. I mean, we have seen this before. And one thing that is different about this time around, is that we have the insight from the lessons we learned last time. As we looked at it this time around, we are flexing our portfolio to address the short-term kind of poultry disruptions. We've had some experience doing this in the past 2 years on how we actually flexed our portfolio, so we can actually be very dynamic in our response. The regions from which we buy Turkey have not been impacted so far. Now, we have seen price increases, that is true. So what we're using is our strategic sourcing network that Miguel spoke about to provide those supply and will remain agile as we go forward. And we're working closely with our retail partners so that we can navigate as the situation evolves. But again, I think we have seen that we have learned in the past, we're applying those lessons, and reality is that we're flexing our portfolio in order to navigate through this. On the SG&A, we have in the first quarter having a onetime gain from last year that do not get repeated. So pretty much, that's what's driving the entire impairments that you're asking. So let me take that. I would say, so far, what we're seeing from private label is that they're actually increasing their prices in line with the branded players. The reality is the cost escalating for everyone. And in terms of Kraft Heinz, I mean, what I'll tell you is that we are stronger today than we have been in the past in 4 specific areas. One, we actually have relatively low private label exposure. So today, we're about 11% of the portfolio exposed to private label versus 17% just a couple of years ago. And if you think about that number of 11% versus an industry average of about 20%, it certainly puts us in an advantage situation. We're also making sure that we are launching products that are differentiated at each round of the price ladder. So whether it's entry to mainstream to premium, so that consumers can stay with our franchise as their circumstances may change. Whether it's a -- in a blue box Mac & Cheese to an Easy Mac, they have something to come into and stay with our icon brands. And we also continue to improve the product design so that we can offer better value for the money and greater ingredient flexibility, less waste and lower production cost and actually, you'll see that in our marketing also as we go forward. And then finally, we're also leveraging the breadth of our portfolio across categories so that we can provide comprehensive occasion-based solutions that the whole family can enjoy. So we are in a very good place right now in terms of our exposures, and we are seeing kind of a private label being affected by the same way that we have. Well, thank you for your question, and I think we're all jealous of Chris, by the way. What I will tell you is that we expect an increase in elasticity going forward closer to historical levels. So prices are -- everything is on the way up, and we know that most of the stimulus is gone. Now, today, we're seeing that elasticity is running about 30% to 40% below historical levels. Now, the reason we're confident about our production is that we are also growing consumption sequentially as we rebuild retail inventory levels. So understand that we are actually making the advancements, again, many of the supply chain challenges that today, are actually holding back our market share performance. That's why as we think about the Q1 production up 10%, it is to support the rebuilding that inventory levels that have been still below our historical levels. And that we feel confident about us continues into that kind of level of support. Well, it's 10% in Q1. Look, we -- I think that's where the inventory review discussion comes from, right, which is important. Because we are rebuilding inventories right now. So despite the volumes are being down, we still need to produce a lot to recover the inventory level. So we don't expect any relevant impact from fixed COGS in this fiscal year. The pause means that it's difficult to kind of back into that right now, Chris. I think from the perspective of kind of rebuilding the inventories and then, netted against some of the supply constraints and how that translated through the shelf, in addition to the Easter shift, there's a lot of variables moving through that. So that's something we'll have to try to circle back to you."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at the Kraft Heinz Company and welcome to our Q&A session for our fourth quarter 2023 business update. During today\u2019s call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com, under News and Events, for a discussion of our non-financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin the Q&A session, it gives me great pleasure to hand it over to Carlos Abrams-Rivera for opening comments and to host his first earnings update as our Chief Executive Officer. Carlos, over to you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. Before opening the call for questions, I just would like to say thank you to all my colleagues here at Kraft Heinz for delivering another solid 2023 results, and at the same time, making the strategic investment for the future. And frankly, all that while navigating some persistent industry pressures. I am very enthusiastic for our next chapter here at Kraft Heinz. And in 2024, we expect to drive top line growth, return to positive volumes, expand gross margins and operating margins and continue to reinvest in the business and an iconic brands. With that, I have Andre joining me today. Let's open the call for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for questions. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning.\nAndre Maciel: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Carlos, I was hoping to start out maybe organic sales in the fourth quarter were impacted, as you talked about by trade timing and a retail inventory deload. You're suggesting that you expect the first quarter organic sales to be similar to 4Q, which implies that underlying sales maybe could be a bit worse than 4Q. I don't think you expect the retailer deload to continue. So, if I have that right, I guess, what would cause the sequential slowdown in organic sales in 1Q? And how do you see that playing out moving forward?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. Good question, Andrew. Thank you for that. The math on Q4 to Q1 may be similar, but the factors driving it are very, very different. I think maybe, Andre, if you can give a little more color as to the effects of both the North America business versus the emerging market business and how that's shaping kind of the math behind the numbers?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. Good morning, again, Andrew. So, we -- as Carlos said, we do expect similar numbers from Q4, but coming from different drivers. So, on North America, we do expect better performance because we should not repeat both the trade timing and the inventory deload. We think we're going to be at a healthy level at this point and sellout. If anything, maybe it will be in line or slightly better getting to Q1. Now when you talk about emerging markets, we do expect a shipment phasing that will affect Q1. So, we do expect, instead of growing double-digits like we have been doing consistently, emerging markets should be growing the mid single digit territory. You might remember that last year, we had a very strong performance in Latin America. Brazil grew 40% in Q1. So, we're going to lap it that, but nothing wrong with the underlying sellout trends both in North America and emerging markets.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Really helpful. And then, Carlos, it seems -- like if I have this right, most of the pressure in the GROW platform in the fourth quarter was in Easy Meals. If I had that right, can you talk a bit about what caused that, and maybe how this plays out as you move into the first quarter? Because it sounds like you do expect North America to get better.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. And frankly, Andrew, if I think about Q4 -- let me start with some of the positive, which is we also saw the return to growth of our Ore-Ida business, driving both growth and share performance as we continue to leverage kind of the new partnership we have with our Simplot and really being able to service the business to its full potential. Now on the kind of headwind side, I think we saw some challenges in our mac & cheese business. Frankly, it's a business that is driven disproportionately by our SNAP exposure. So that affected some of the business in Q4. However, as I think about going forward, there are three key things we're doing to make sure we improve the trajectory: One, we're also making -- we are investing further in our new campaign behind mac & cheese and driving new innovation behind it as well. So, you'll see from us additional areas around bringing new SKU flavors. We're bringing variety packs and we're bringing, you may have seen a new plant-based option with mac & cheese in a partnership with NotCo. We're also making sure we continue to drive even better value with mac & cheese by leveraging the fact that we have in our portfolio, partnership that we can do with brands like Oscar Mayer to offer truly a complete meal solution for consumers, plus offering multipacks around 12 packs and 4 packs in different formats to different types of consumers who are looking for value. And then finally, we're also making sure we're partnering with retails, we're actually improving the overall assortment to optimize the traffic down the aisle. So, I feel very good about the fact that the team have been able to acknowledge what happen and taking -- creating a new plan for us into '24 to improve the performance of Easy Meals.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much and see you all next week.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks operator. Good morning everyone. I just had a -- I have a question about Foodservice and maybe if you can just drill in a little bit. In North America, it decelerated relative to the previous quarters. And I think even in your slide, you've got underperformed relative to the industry. And so, I guess a couple of questions there. One is just is there a trade or an inventory deload happening in Foodservice. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the respective channels within Foodservice, what got better and maybe what got worse? And then sort of your expectations, both for North America and global on Foodservice, do you expect it to be kind of in line with your algorithm for Foodservice this year or maybe even a touch better. Just want to unpack that Foodservice a little bit more, please.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Glad to. Let me start by clarifying something you said in your question. In our Foodservice business, we are growing both ahead of the industry in North America and International. So, I think that we actually feel very good about our performance on Foodservice, and we see that as we go forward into 2024. So, we see Foodservice growing up -- growing in 2024 in our long -- appropriate with our long-term guidance. So high single digits. So, we think actually it's going to be a continued driver of our performance as we go into 2024. And frankly, we see that us having even more coming as we go forward because we are not only performing well where we are, but we also are improving by getting into new higher margin channels like independent and non-commercial channels, plus driving big innovation, leveraging our technology, leveraging the iconic brands that we have. So until now, we have seen the beginning of the potential of Foodservice and that is actually driving faster growth than we have seen in the industry. And we actually believe that between the innovation that we have between us going into new channels that are higher margin and more attractive, we can actually make that even a faster growing part of our portfolio as we go forward.\nBryan Spillane: I guess if I'm looking at slide nine correctly, I think you've got the industry growing faster than your North America business in the fourth quarter. So, again, it just seems like -- I don't know if there's a disconnect between what you shipped versus what consumption was. But -- again, unless I'm looking at this slide incorrectly, it actually looks like you underperformed the industry.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me just say, I think you are looking at the slide incorrectly, and happy to follow up with you \u2026\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nStephen Powers: Hey, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning.\nStephen Powers: Carlos, I guess stepping back, I'd just like a little bit more detail on your conviction surrounding improve total portfolio volume trends and presumably volume share trends and a return to growth as you progress through '24. Because on the one hand, I understand drivers that you talked about in your prepared remarks. On the other hand, we're coming off a quarter that saw you tweak organic growth expectations lower coming into the quarter and then effectively undershoot those expectations when the dust settled. So, I guess, again, what gives you the confidence that we're not only leveling off, but we're approaching a level that where we can return to growth without, I guess, incremental investment in promotions and price because it doesn't seem like that's part of the outlook.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Right. Let me just -- let me unpack that a little bit. First, as you -- as Andre mentioned earlier, there is some factors specifically affecting our Q4 performance in terms of trade as well as inventory that we're not going to repeat as we go forward. As we go into 2024, if I think about, first, the top line, we are going to continue the progression of emerging market at Foodservice. And then emerging markets already growing volume. We have seen the progress of our Foodservice business growing faster than the industry. And in North America on the top line, we actually expect to recover share as we are now making all the payoff of the innovation investments we have made, we'll start seeing that coming throughout the year. So I think that idea of us continue to invest in the right things behind our insights in North America, it's paying out with innovation. And then it also to have the right business plans with our retailers. Those factors actually are going to help us drive the top line with confidence. If I think about kind of the -- specifically, you talked about volume. One of the things that we are looking at is we are anticipating a return to the historical activity levels. And in fact, we are seeing that already. So, we are expecting volumes to turn positive in the second half in the year because as I mentioned, the idea of us continue to invest in innovation that actually will give us the right tailwinds as we go into the year, plus we no longer will have some headwinds associated with both pricing that we took in Q1 of last year as well as the SNAP benefits cycling that as we go into the second half of the year. So that also -- that all together gives me the confidence that we can see that us coming together with a better performance we're going to '24 in a way that actually allows us to exit the year in an algo for us as a company.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Okay. Very good. Very good. Thank you. And then Andre, if I could, there was -- the free cash flow conversion this year improved as it was expected to. So that's a positive. I guess, just as we look into '24, how are you thinking about free cash flow conversion in the New Year. Can we expect further improvements? And if not, either way, I guess, what are the drivers of free cash flow progress as we go forward? Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. And good morning. So yeah, as you pointed out, we were able to deliver a very solid cash flow conversion in 2023, above 80%. And we do expect a small progression also as we head into 2024. We still going to be in the 80s territory because we do expect another year of solid CapEx investment like we have been doing in the last two years. There's a lot of good investment opportunities for us in the organic business. Yeah, and we have some taxes step-up that we also mentioned it's affecting earnings as well. So those two factors go against that. But on the other hand, the working capital should expect to continue to improve as a consequence of the investments we have been making.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The one thing I would add too is as we go into -- those of you joining us in CAGNY, we'll be able to unpack to a little more of our investments we're making. I mentioned quite a bit about innovation, about how we are going to continue to invest in our brands, making sure they are superior to our competition. So I think you'll see a little more details that from myself and the team when we're together in Florida.\nStephen Powers: Okay. Very good. We will see you there. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning. Just curious, there's some early indications that maybe as an industry, quick service restaurants, seeing some fraying at the edges in terms of consumer demand, mainly under the weight of higher prices. I'm just curious if this is something you're seeing as well. And to what extent, if at all, does your outlook maybe potentially factor some kind of slowdown there.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. In our business, frankly, a lot of our business can is, is really focused on front of the house. And we're actually seeing solid performance for our away-from-home business, both in the U.S. and as well as outside the U.S. And if you think about the fact that outside the U.S., we use that channel very much as a way for us to drive awareness and build their brands. That continues to drive positive growth for us. In the U.S. as well, we see that even within the context of QSR, we continue to see progress and improvement. But at the same time, we're also expanding into new channels that allows us to continue to drive the growth, whether that is from our vending opportunities into new hospitality areas. So, we also are having a little bit of a broader view of how we define our away-from-home business to go into new spaces that we know are margin accretive and not be dependent on just one channel in order for us to drive the growth.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thank you for that. And then the gross margin increase you're expecting this year despite a little bit of lingering inflation. Can you just remind us what some of the key drivers will be of that? Is it simply a continuation of would help 2023 in terms of COGS efficiencies and some revenue growth management assistance?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So, we expect gross margin to expand again and is part of our long-term algorithm, we feel proud of what we have done so far. Remind that we always have been pricing to offset inflation in dollar for dollar, and that's what we have done in the last two years. However, in 2024, we are expecting to price approximately at 1% level, which is below the inflation that we're expected at 3%. But -- so the main driver is really coming from the gross efficiencies. We have been delivering ahead of what we outlined to you a couple of years back. So 2023 are very solid year, almost 4% of gross efficiency as a percentage of COGS. And in 2024, we expect another solid year. So, this gross efficiency is helping us, not only to offset a component of the inflation, but also is helping us to expanding gross margins and investing a little more in the business on the SG&A side. And that's something that you should expect to see from us.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nPamela Kaufman: Good morning.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning, Pamela.\nAndre Maciel: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: I was hoping that you could double click a bit into the drivers behind your Q4 results in North America and how you're thinking about those factors going forward? You pointed to weaker consumer demand, but also discrete headwinds like the inventory deload and lapping the trade accrual. So, how are you thinking about North America consumer demand in '24? And can you explain what drove the one-time dynamics? Was it a specific retailer or specific categories where you saw a deload? And maybe you can explain the effect of the trade accrual. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me start and give you a sense for how we see the consumer today. And then maybe, Andre, you can go deeper into the specifics about the Q4 and how we are -- how we see that playing as we go forward. But I guess the place that will start would be that what we're seeing in the data is regardless of the income levels that consumer is looking for value and they continue to be under pressure. And what we see is low income consumers are actually shopping more at places like Dollar Stores, higher income consumers, more club stores. But mostly, we are seeing them looking for overall, smaller trips to stretch their dollar further. So for us, it continues to be about how do we continue to deliver value in different ways to that consumer who are very much focused on value through intentionally investing in our brands making sure we have a longer value offerings and increasing the distribution in different channels to be what we have done in the past. And let me just be specific before Andre give you the details on the Q4. And if I think about club channels, we have introduced a number of brands into club from Capri Sun to Lunchables Classical Pasta Sauce. In fact, we also tested new innovation in our club channels. And in 2024, we'll have 20% higher number of offerings into club that we did in 2023. Now if I think about the enterprise points in the category and the SKU that we can have in kind of areas around Dollar Stores, we're actually making sure that we're driving things like improving on assortment of barbecue and mustard or crab of mayo and salad dressing as well as new items around Taco Bell and our partnership that we have in order for us to drive expanded use of our Mexican initiatives. So if I think about Dollar Store, we actually have today over 300 SKUs. And year-over-year, we're going to be increasing about another 10% versus what we had in the past. So, we are making sure that we are in the right channels with the right assortment and continue to invest in our innovation in order to make sure that we could absolute consumers looking for value independent of where they're looking for different occasions, different formats, different shopping behaviors. And now, Andre, if you want to give a little more context on the Q4.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So North America net sales declined 3%, and approximately 140 bps is linked to the trade accrual release from last year into -- probably 2022 and from inventory deload year-over-year. But in fact, it's not that we saw a deload happening in 2023, that in Q4 2022, as we started to recover, services start to ship ahead of consumption. So we are lapping that effect. So there's nothing really on that regard affecting 2023, it's just a lapping effect. Now the sellout was negative, and it was softer than what we anticipated. We underestimated the impact of SNAP in Q4. It turned out to be more than 150 basis points stronger than we thought. If you remember, there was a concentration of emergency allotments at the end of 2022. So, on a year-over-year basis, there is benefits declined close to 40%, which is substantial. And that's what affected a lot of sellout. We should continue to see some of that in Q1. So, on a year-over-year basis, Q1 '24 will still be about 20% less SNAP than last year. So, we're still going to suffer a portion of this effect. But on the other hand, our market share has improved in Q4 as we anticipated, which is a very good sign. We are living -- exiting the year with the best share performance of 2023. So that give us a lot of good momentum heading into this year. Hope that helps.\nPamela Kaufman: Yes. Thanks. Just a quick clarification. So, are you saying that SNAP was a greater headwind in the fourth quarter than the prior two quarters? And why do you think that is?\nAndre Maciel: Yes, Absolutely. Yeah. Because there is a concentration of emergency allotments considered in Q4 of -- in '22. So, there is SNAP a benefit in Q4 '22 were actually higher than Q2 and Q3 2022.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay. Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: And this itself is not a surprise. I mean, we just underestimated the elasticity of that.\nPamela Kaufman: Understood. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. Those of us analyzing your commodity exposure see a lot of deflation running through on the ingredient side, maybe even the packaging side. And your guidance is for inflation to be positive. Can you walk through some of the components that we can't see, maybe it's conversion costs or things like that, that make this a -- continue to be an inflationary year? And then my second question was, you have a $25 million write-down for, I think, systems related to your modernization efforts. Can you go into a little more detail as to what caused that write-down? Thanks.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. Good morning, Robert. Good to hear from you. So on the inflation side, as we said in prepared remarks, we do expect inflation again into 2024, low single digits on the 3% territory. Even though ingredients as a whole, we see quite a few commodities that are deflationary. We still have the impact of maybe tomatoes and sugar affecting us negatively. So, there is a little net increase in terms of commodity inflation. And then -- but the biggest bulk of the inflation is really coming from labor. We continue to see a relevant higher than pre-pandemic level on wage increase as well as transportation making 2023, the transportation costs were quite low, and we are seeing some signs of rebound on the transportation cost side. So, this is where inflation is mostly coming from. On the second part of the question about the $25 million. So not 100% of that is the system write-off, even though it's the majority of it. And this has to do with us deciding not to maintain investment in a certain technology that we think will not be relevant for the future. So, we decided to stop that investment and redirected issue, something that we think will be more relevant towards future agenda [ph]. As you know, technology is front and center of our strategy. And we have continued to make decisions to make sure that we can turn it into a competitive advantage to us. So -- and if this might require us to make decisions in between a quarter that we do not initially anticipated because we saw that that's the right thing for the business for the long-term. We're not going to hesitate to do that.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you, Andre.\nAndre Maciel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning.\nJohn Baumgartner: First off -- good morning. Wondering if you could provide an update on the outlook for efficiencies. Just given the over delivery in 2023, what's included in the guide for 2024. And as you think out to this next round of improvements, specifically the new overhead savings from automation, fixed assets. How are you thinking about the timing for when those benefits begin to accrue?\nAndre Maciel: Great. So thanks for the question. As we said, 2023 are very solid year. We delivered close to 4% of efficiencies as a percentage of COGS. And we do expect 2024 to be another year where we will be delivering ahead of the 3% COGS that we have outlined. I want to make sure that you understand that not only this is a consequence of the complete ways of working changes that we have done in supply chain, more focused on variable costs and continuous improvements. But also we are -- we still have some efficiency opportunities that are coming through as a consequence of the pandemic and all the inefficiency generated by that. That helped in 2023, and that is still going to help a little bit in 2024. But beyond that, there are a lot of things happening on the supply chain space, difficult to name only one because given the share size of our COGS, but we do have initiatives coming from network optimization in the U.S. We have a very complex distribution center network, more than 80 distribution centers overall. We do have initiatives in automation. In fact, we have a very strong partnership with Microsoft trying to do -- using technology to allow us to make faster decisions. And if that improves labor usage and reduce yield losses. We have a lot of opportunities on value engineering to continue to make sure to offer the right type of attributes to consumers. So, there is a lot of different levers. We're going to touch on a few of them next week in CAGNY, but I think we are very pleased with the quality of the pipeline we have in supply chain now.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: And I think you will see is that how the investments we have been making in technology, the partnership we have been making in digital are basically fueling a lot of that efficiency in a way that actually creates some benefit for us for now and to the future as well. And again, will impact that even further when we are together in Florida.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just quickly on international. The emerging markets vol mix was pretty solid in Q4. But I'm wondering if you can speak to the vol mix in the developed markets, what you're seeing in Europe from category performance, private label competition and the consumer dynamics there sort of giving you confidence in the international guide for 2024. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Happy to. I think if we think about what we have mentioned in terms of value and how consumers are looking for value in the U.S. is similar as well, too, in terms of consumers in Europe. I mean, they are looking for that value as well. And we are continuing to make sure that we're bringing that value through the critical brands that we have, like our Heinz business in the U.K., for example, and how we continue to bring the products to the market that bring a number of improvements on our quality of our products as well as focusing on the benefit that we bring.  So, for example, a product like HEINZ Beanz and the fact that brings kind of such a benefit around protein, that's something that is kind of now shifting in terms of how we think about that product. The fact that we're also bringing within certain part of our categories, new entries by leverage to our brands. So, in baked beans we will have not only the HEINZ Beanz, but we also have HP baked beans. And that allows us to actually play in a couple of different areas with consumers, both at a more mainstream as well as to more value. And then in places like Germany, we're also introducing new benefits to consumers as they are looking also again for value, whether that is Heinz Mayonnaise in new channels in the discount spaces, but also making sure that we continue to bring the innovation consumers are looking for from us. Like our Heinz Tomato Ketchup with zero sugar. So, we are approaching it with the same sense as we do in the U.S., which is let's make sure we're in the right channel with the right assortment. And at the same time, let's focus on bringing -- and focusing on the benefits that we bring with our products.\nJohn Baumgartner: Thanks Carlos. Thanks Andre.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you very much.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Anne-Marie Megela for any closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and thank you, everyone for your interest. We look forward to seeing you next week.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Good morning. Sure. Good morning, again, Andrew. So, we -- as Carlos said, we do expect similar numbers from Q4, but coming from different drivers. So, on North America, we do expect better performance because we should not repeat both the trade timing and the inventory deload. We think we're going to be at a healthy level at this point and sellout. If anything, maybe it will be in line or slightly better getting to Q1. Now when you talk about emerging markets, we do expect a shipment phasing that will affect Q1. So, we do expect, instead of growing double-digits like we have been doing consistently, emerging markets should be growing the mid single digit territory. You might remember that last year, we had a very strong performance in Latin America. Brazil grew 40% in Q1. So, we're going to lap it that, but nothing wrong with the underlying sellout trends both in North America and emerging markets. Sure. And good morning. So yeah, as you pointed out, we were able to deliver a very solid cash flow conversion in 2023, above 80%. And we do expect a small progression also as we head into 2024.

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. Before opening the call for questions, I just would like to say thank you to all my colleagues here at Kraft Heinz for delivering another solid 2023 results, and at the same time, making the strategic investment for the future. And frankly, all that while navigating some persistent industry pressures. I am very enthusiastic for our next chapter here at Kraft Heinz. And in 2024, we expect to drive top line growth, return to positive volumes, expand gross margins and operating margins and continue to reinvest in the business and an iconic brands. With that, I have Andre joining me today. Let's open the call for the Q&A. Good morning. Yeah. Good question, Andrew. Thank you for that. The math on Q4 to Q1 may be similar, but the factors driving it are very, very different. I think maybe, Andre, if you can give a little more color as to the effects of both the North America business versus the emerging market business and how that's shaping kind of the math behind the numbers? Yeah. And frankly, Andrew, if I think about Q4 -- let me start with some of the positive, which is we also saw the return to growth of our Ore-Ida business, driving both growth and share performance as we continue to leverage kind of the new partnership we have with our Simplot and really being able to service the business to its full potential. Now on the kind of headwind side, I think we saw some challenges in our mac & cheese business. Frankly, it's a business that is driven disproportionately by our SNAP exposure. So that affected some of the business in Q4. However, as I think about going forward, there are three key things we're doing to make sure we improve the trajectory: One, we're also making -- we are investing further in our new campaign behind mac & cheese and driving new innovation behind it as well. So, you'll see from us additional areas around bringing new SKU flavors. We're bringing variety packs and we're bringing, you may have seen a new plant-based option with mac & cheese in a partnership with NotCo. We're also making sure we continue to drive even better value with mac & cheese by leveraging the fact that we have in our portfolio, partnership that we can do with brands like Oscar Mayer to offer truly a complete meal solution for consumers, plus offering multipacks around 12 packs and 4 packs in different formats to different types of consumers who are looking for value. And then finally, we're also making sure we're partnering with retails, we're actually improving the overall assortment to optimize the traffic down the aisle. So, I feel very good about the fact that the team have been able to acknowledge what happen and taking -- creating a new plan for us into '24 to improve the performance of Easy Meals. Thank you. Glad to. Let me start by clarifying something you said in your question. In our Foodservice business, we are growing both ahead of the industry in North America and International. So, I think that we actually feel very good about our performance on Foodservice, and we see that as we go forward into 2024. So, we see Foodservice growing up -- growing in 2024 in our long -- appropriate with our long-term guidance. So high single digits. So, we think actually it's going to be a continued driver of our performance as we go into 2024. And frankly, we see that us having even more coming as we go forward because we are not only performing well where we are, but we also are improving by getting into new higher margin channels like independent and non-commercial channels, plus driving big innovation, leveraging our technology, leveraging the iconic brands that we have. So until now, we have seen the beginning of the potential of Foodservice and that is actually driving faster growth than we have seen in the industry. And we actually believe that between the innovation that we have between us going into new channels that are higher margin and more attractive, we can actually make that even a faster growing part of our portfolio as we go forward. Let me just say, I think you are looking at the slide incorrectly, and happy to follow up with you ... Thank you. Good morning. Right. Let me just -- let me unpack that a little bit. First, as you -- as Andre mentioned earlier, there is some factors specifically affecting our Q4 performance in terms of trade as well as inventory that we're not going to repeat as we go forward. As we go into 2024, if I think about, first, the top line, we are going to continue the progression of emerging market at Foodservice. And then emerging markets already growing volume. We have seen the progress of our Foodservice business growing faster than the industry. And in North America on the top line, we actually expect to recover share as we are now making all the payoff of the innovation investments we have made, we'll start seeing that coming throughout the year. So I think that idea of us continue to invest in the right things behind our insights in North America, it's paying out with innovation. And then it also to have the right business plans with our retailers. Those factors actually are going to help us drive the top line with confidence. If I think about kind of the -- specifically, you talked about volume. One of the things that we are looking at is we are anticipating a return to the historical activity levels. And in fact, we are seeing that already. So, we are expecting volumes to turn positive in the second half in the year because as I mentioned, the idea of us continue to invest in innovation that actually will give us the right tailwinds as we go into the year, plus we no longer will have some headwinds associated with both pricing that we took in Q1 of last year as well as the SNAP benefits cycling that as we go into the second half of the year. So that also -- that all together gives me the confidence that we can see that us coming together with a better performance we're going to '24 in a way that actually allows us to exit the year in an algo for us as a company. The one thing I would add too is as we go into -- those of you joining us in CAGNY, we'll be able to unpack to a little more of our investments we're making. I mentioned quite a bit about innovation, about how we are going to continue to invest in our brands, making sure they are superior to our competition. So I think you'll see a little more details that from myself and the team when we're together in Florida. Thank you. Yeah. In our business, frankly, a lot of our business can is, is really focused on front of the house. And we're actually seeing solid performance for our away-from-home business, both in the U.S. and as well as outside the U.S. And if you think about the fact that outside the U.S., we use that channel very much as a way for us to drive awareness and build their brands. That continues to drive positive growth for us. In the U.S. as well, we see that even within the context of QSR, we continue to see progress and improvement. But at the same time, we're also expanding into new channels that allows us to continue to drive the growth, whether that is from our vending opportunities into new hospitality areas. So, we also are having a little bit of a broader view of how we define our away-from-home business to go into new spaces that we know are margin accretive and not be dependent on just one channel in order for us to drive the growth. Good morning, Pamela. Let me start and give you a sense for how we see the consumer today. And then maybe, Andre, you can go deeper into the specifics about the Q4 and how we are -- how we see that playing as we go forward. But I guess the place that will start would be that what we're seeing in the data is regardless of the income levels that consumer is looking for value and they continue to be under pressure. And what we see is low income consumers are actually shopping more at places like Dollar Stores, higher income consumers, more club stores. But mostly, we are seeing them looking for overall, smaller trips to stretch their dollar further. So for us, it continues to be about how do we continue to deliver value in different ways to that consumer who are very much focused on value through intentionally investing in our brands making sure we have a longer value offerings and increasing the distribution in different channels to be what we have done in the past. And let me just be specific before Andre give you the details on the Q4. And if I think about club channels, we have introduced a number of brands into club from Capri Sun to Lunchables Classical Pasta Sauce. In fact, we also tested new innovation in our club channels. And in 2024, we'll have 20% higher number of offerings into club that we did in 2023. Now if I think about the enterprise points in the category and the SKU that we can have in kind of areas around Dollar Stores, we're actually making sure that we're driving things like improving on assortment of barbecue and mustard or crab of mayo and salad dressing as well as new items around Taco Bell and our partnership that we have in order for us to drive expanded use of our Mexican initiatives. So if I think about Dollar Store, we actually have today over 300 SKUs. And year-over-year, we're going to be increasing about another 10% versus what we had in the past. So, we are making sure that we are in the right channels with the right assortment and continue to invest in our innovation in order to make sure that we could absolute consumers looking for value independent of where they're looking for different occasions, different formats, different shopping behaviors. And now, Andre, if you want to give a little more context on the Q4. Good morning. And I think you will see is that how the investments we have been making in technology, the partnership we have been making in digital are basically fueling a lot of that efficiency in a way that actually creates some benefit for us for now and to the future as well. And again, will impact that even further when we are together in Florida. Happy to. I think if we think about what we have mentioned in terms of value and how consumers are looking for value in the U.S. is similar as well, too, in terms of consumers in Europe. I mean, they are looking for that value as well. And we are continuing to make sure that we're bringing that value through the critical brands that we have, like our Heinz business in the U.K., for example, and how we continue to bring the products to the market that bring a number of improvements on our quality of our products as well as focusing on the benefit that we bring.  So, for example, a product like HEINZ Beanz and the fact that brings kind of such a benefit around protein, that's something that is kind of now shifting in terms of how we think about that product. The fact that we're also bringing within certain part of our categories, new entries by leverage to our brands. So, in baked beans we will have not only the HEINZ Beanz, but we also have HP baked beans. And that allows us to actually play in a couple of different areas with consumers, both at a more mainstream as well as to more value. And then in places like Germany, we're also introducing new benefits to consumers as they are looking also again for value, whether that is Heinz Mayonnaise in new channels in the discount spaces, but also making sure that we continue to bring the innovation consumers are looking for from us. Like our Heinz Tomato Ketchup with zero sugar. So, we are approaching it with the same sense as we do in the U.S., which is let's make sure we're in the right channel with the right assortment. And at the same time, let's focus on bringing -- and focusing on the benefits that we bring with our products. Thank you."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Global Investor Relations.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our Q&A session for our third quarter 2023 business update. During today\u2019s call, we may have forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which excludes certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com, under News and Events, for a discussion of our non-financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I\u2019m going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for some brief opening remarks.\nMiguel Patricio: Well thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you all for being with us today. And before opening the call for questions, I just would like to thank Kraft Heinz, my entire team for another great quarter. And again, I would like just to highlight some positive aspects about this quarter. We are generating accelerated profitable growth fueled by our three pillars. Our share and volume trends are improving as a result of the action plans that we are implementing. And we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, hitting our target net leverage of approximately 3x. And then we continue to invest in the future with another quarter of significant investments in marketing, technology and R&D. Well, with that, I have here with me today, Andre and Carlos. And so, let\u2019s open the call for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. In Slide 33 of the slide deck this morning, you call out branded promotional activity is still below \u201819 levels, and Kraft activity is below branded. So one clarification, Is the branded figure you highlight all food categories, or just the branded players within Kraft Heinz\u2019s categories? And then I guess based on your plans for the remainder of the year and looking into \u201824, I guess how would you anticipate these metrics shifting? Do you expect branded promo levels to return to historical levels? And would you expect Kraft Heinz to narrow the gap versus branded? Or how do you see those metrics moving from here? Thanks so much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks, Andrew. It\u2019s Carlos. Let me first address your point about clarification. What you see in the page, it is about those branded players that do compete with Kraft Heinz. The second part in terms of how do we think about our promotions as we go forward. First, I will tell you that I\u2019m not going to comment on what other companies may or may not do. But I will tell you is that, one, we\u2019re not going back to 2019 levels. We are going to \u2013 at the same time, as we go forward into Q4, we know there is a seasonality to our business. And as we have said earlier, we\u2019re going to make sure now as we go into the holiday season, that we make the right investments to support our business. Now I\u2019ll say that at the same time, we\u2019re going to continue with the same level of discipline that we have shown until now to make sure that our investment with the right level of ROI as we go forward. Thanks for the question Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess just in North America, on the volume piece, there is a fair amount of discussion both in the prepared remarks around kind of meats being a drag this quarter. And you discussed a bit about how you\u2019re giving up maybe some volume to maximize profitability and gross margins. But then you also kind of discussed how service levels aren\u2019t where you want them to be, particularly in sliced meats, and you\u2019re expecting improvement on that going forward. So I guess the question is just what should we be taking away from those comments? Are you kind of continuing to scale back on volume and focus on the profitability there? Or should we think about a volume share recovery and maybe some headwinds to the margin mix that come with that, particularly as we think about North America volume? Thanks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: First of all, I think that \u2013 let me just put into context kind of the volume question that you see in North America. First, I would say is that what you see for us as a company, we continue to improve sequentially from what you saw in Q3 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Q2 to now in Q2 \u2013 in Q3. And then, if I look holistically at the company first, you\u2019ll see that we continue to drive the things that are working for us. We are continuing to grow in Emerging Markets where we\u2019re growing volume mix year-over-year now in Q3, that we continue to expand in our Foodservice and that we believe that it continues to drive opportunity as we go forward. And then specifically in the U.S. business, you see how the investment we have made in terms of improving our share of shelf, our investments in marketing, our investing in innovation and our improvement in CFR have continued to improve overall actions. Now as we think about the total portfolio, there are some places in which we\u2019re going to remain focused and disciplined on how we invest back into the business. I think you referred to in our meat business, where we want to make sure that we are not going to be just following unprofitable growth, but that we\u2019re going to be rational and disciplined on how we invest in those businesses in order for us to drive the right consumer pull, but at the same time, not sacrificing the overall profitability of the business that we need to maintain.\nAndre Maciel: I will just add that in our long-term algorithm, volume is important to us. So in our 2%, 3% growth, it comes from a balanced contribution between price and volumes or volumes there, but as Carlos said, we are seeking profitable volume growth. We are not trying to maximize gross percentage margin, we are trying to deliver profitable, sustainable growth, ultimately translating to sustainable EPS growth. Thanks for your question. \nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. You may proceed.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Carlos, I just wanted to touch on the meats business again, coming back to Peter\u2019s question. You point out it\u2019s an energized business, but the category is seeing price competition, private label is gaining share, that was not happening at the outset during COVID, during work from home. It just seems as though the ambition to rebuild or maintain profit, it\u2019s hard to square that with what looks like a need to reinvest more given the declines. So how do you think about resource allocation, your willingness to continue reinvesting in that business relative to the point where you just say, hey, these assets may be better suited to another owner like what happened with the nuts business. Just curious about your willingness to stick with it given a very tough backdrop in the category. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Andre, why don\u2019t you start here, and I can build.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So as we have said before, different parts of our portfolio, they have different roles, and these roles might change over time. The role for me right now is to rebuild the profitability which has enrolled at 50% in the last 5 years while continuing to invest in the brands to improve, innovate, so then at some point, this brand can be in a position to grow in a profitable way again. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. In Q3, for the second quarter in a row, this part of the portfolio, declined mid to high single digits on the top line but grew mid to high single digits on the bottom line, not by milking the brand, but by making the type of \u2013 the right type of investment and the right type of actions that are appropriate for this portfolio right now. For us to be chasing volume with this in an unsustainable way, only through promotion, that\u2019s not the game that this \u2013 that we want this brand to play.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The only thing I would add is that even in \u2013 if you think about our cold cut business within our meat business, we have continued to improve our CFR, but that is the one area where we\u2019re still not at the right level of service that we want for the year. You\u2019ll see that progression. At the same time, as we have improved our service, we have also began to see improvement in our share, too. So if you look at month to date as well through October, we are seeing that, in fact, our cold cuts business are beginning to gain share. So we are just going to be looking at the category in a very disciplined way to make sure we\u2019re doing the right things, as Andre said.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay, thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Fair questions, John.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nStephen Powers: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to shift gears, if I could, and talk about the momentum you have in both Foodservice and Emerging Markets and just get your perspective on your confidence that momentum can continue and perhaps how the organizational changes that you announced today internationally might contribute to that momentum as we go forward. And also Andre, if you could, if I could tack on a second question, just now that leverage has dipped below that target level of 3x, just wondering how you\u2019re starting to think about prioritization of cash going forward. Because the cash generation has been good, I presume cash will build and just think about how you\u2019re thinking about allocating that cash going forward. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you for the question, Stephen. Andre, why don\u2019t you comment on the capital allocation, then I\u2019ll talk about Foodservice and Emerging Markets.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So on capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. That means continue to fund our very competitive dividend, maintain investment grade and prioritizing organic growth like we have been consistently doing during the past 3, 4 years. We are very proud that we were able to get to this level of leverage 1-year ahead of our initial expectation, and that\u2019s very important. That shows that the business is strong and the organization is focused on delivering sustainable performance not only on the EBITDA side, but also in cash conversion, which is a remarkable improvement of this organization. And now I think that puts us in a very good situation to assess options to deploy this cash, and we are looking at those.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks, Andre. Let me comment first on Foodservice. I feel very optimistic about our plans in Foodservice. And we have really been working on building a foundation for the future. And if you think about the way we are thinking about building our business in basically three areas, we continue to make the investments in our chef-led models and that\u2019s driving positive performance for us. We also are making sure we are competing in more attractive and better margin channels, things like our independent and non-commercial channels versus traditional where we have been limited to. And then lastly, we are seeing much more powerful innovation that allows us to lever the technology investments we have made and bring those into the product forefront, whether that is in things like our Heinz Remix machines and how that actually creates an opportunity for us to separate ourselves for the future. Now if you look at the full year for Foodservice, our expectation is probably to grow somewhere in the low to mid double digits versus last year. And we are \u2013 I will point out that we\u2019re gaining share too, in both North America and the international zone. And then let me just make sure also that it\u2019s clear that if we think about our long-term algorithm, Foodservice is expected to grow about 5%, and we\u2019re going to be well above that level in 2023. Now if I switch over to our Emerging Markets, the one great thing that we also have been investing behind in Emerging Markets is kind of the discipline of our go-to-market model. And for us, the reason we feel so confident is because there is a data-driven go-to-market model that allows us to drive distribution, that then \u2013 we can then build and press in existing markets and enter new ones. And we have done that several locations. In fact, we are on track to implement our model in 90% of Emerging Markets by the end of this year. And just to remind you, in things like \u2013 in the first phase of building distribution, we would build the infrastructure, and then we go into the full structure in order to truly take advantage of our emerging business. I think in Emerging Markets, I would just add the comment that in Q3, we saw a temporary headwind as we think about particularly in Asia, where we have a business in Indonesia that is most surrounding around Ramadan season and where we saw some travel shifting \u2013 spending shifting from travel, away from gifting, and we have a gifting business in Indonesia. So that was that was a temporary thing. But as we think about the year ahead, we believe that we will get back to the right levels of performance also in our Indonesia business. Thanks for the question.\nStephen Powers: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. Just a quick one. In your slide presentation, from the prior quarter 2Q, you mentioned that you were expecting positive volume growth in 2024. I may have missed it, but did you reiterate that today in either of the slides or any of your commentary?\nAndre Maciel: Yes, we did. And that\u2019s the case. Nothing changes. So nothing changed in terms of volume expectations as Carlos said. So we said, and it happened that volume would improve in Q3 sequentially to Q2, and it did. It improved in Q4 versus Q3. And at some point in 2024, the volumes will turn positive.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: In fact, I think everything that we\u2019re seeing right now in the market, in our actions are working. And it just gives us more confidence as we think about our 2024 plans.\nKen Goldman: Sorry, can I just quickly clarify that? I think people interpreted the commentary about positive volume about \u2013 as net throughout 2024, it will be positive. But I think the comment that was just made was at some point in 2024, it will turn positive. I guess I\u2019m curious, do you expect at the end of the year, your total 2024 volume to be positive? I just wanted to get a sense that people aren\u2019t overmodeling the year.\nAndre Maciel: I am not going to give guidance for 2024 right now. What I just said is what we have been saying all along.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. I know we have covered maybe a little bit just on the volume and how to think about its role in the portfolio side, but I want to just come back to one specific piece. You have talked about your approach and being disciplined and rational. But in your prepared remarks too, you also specifically said that in cold cuts, you are investing to hit the right price points. Can you just maybe unpack that a little bit and reconcile how those two go together and what exactly you mean by those investments on the price side?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Good question. Happy to clarify, Michael. What I would say is that we need to make sure that we are responding to the moments in which consumers are going to be looking for the right solutions for whether it\u2019s at the holiday seasons or all the points throughout the year. And as we go into Q4, for example, we will make sure that we are making the right investments. However, we will be doing that with the right level of discipline to make sure we drive the right returns on that investment. So, the idea is that we have simply \u2013 like we stated earlier, we are not going to just be chasing volume, we are going to be looking for what is the way for us to drive profitable volume in a way that combines our ability to continue to build our businesses through the right investments in marketing and using the full array of revenue management tools in order for us to be able to drive the right efficiency and effectiveness of our investments.\nMichael Lavery: And so some of what you are saying would be the depth of the promotion is part of how you want to make the investments on price points, but the discipline is the depth of that and not to push it too hard, would that be a right interpretation?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: I think that would be one of the things that you could say. But I think on top of that, if you think about the full array of our revenue management tools, pricing, price architecture, other tools at our disposal that allows us to actually think about what is the right investments in order for us to maintain the level of \u2013 improving level of profitability that we have seen deteriorate over the last few years.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks so much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nJason English: Okay. Good morning folks. Thanks. So, I guess congrats are in order. Congrats, Miguel, for a good run and the improvements you have driven while at the helm of the company and congrats, Carlos, in the upcoming promotion and responsibility. So, on that topic, I guess the starting-off question is, what do you expect to do different? Should we be bracing and expecting any strategic shifts, or given that you have been an architect of many of the plans that have been in place, is this going to be sort of business as usual?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: First of all, Jason, thank you for the kind words, and I am certainly very much humble and excited about the opportunity ahead for me and for the company. What I would say is that, as you pointed out, I have been sitting next to Miguel for the last almost 4 years now. And I think a number of things that we have done as a company, we certainly have done together. And strategically, I think that I am certainly committed to the three growth pillars that we have for going forward that is \u2013 and think about also how do we continue to drive our expansion in emerging markets, how do we continue to see foodservice as a great growth for us and then the growth platforms within our U.S. business. At the same time, you also probably read some of the changes we are making in our structure in order to actually help us accelerate some of those things that we have done. For me, one of the critical aspects of this time when I have been transitioning as \u2013 and coming to the new role in January, has been listening to the organization and making sure we have the clarity of our strategy. And our structure is going to follow that clarity. So, some of the things you will see in terms of us being able to have a bit of breaking down the international zone which has worked in the past well for us, but now as we go into a new way of us growing, allows us to be a little more focused on those emerging markets in which we are going to make some additional investments. That, I think is part of us thinking differently about how we bring that structure and so that strategy to life in our structure. So, that\u2019s I think some of the things that you are going to see, is what are the places that \u2013 with the lens of the jobs to be done for the strategy of the company, that we can maybe arrange certain things where we can truly leverage the scale of the company, the scale that we have been investing behind our technology and our marketing capabilities and to deploy them against the three pillars strategically that I am very much aligned with.\nJason English: And should we expect inorganic solutions to come into the fold a little bit more so now that your balance sheet is in a better situation?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: As Andre said earlier, we continue to look at opportunities, but I would say that\u2019s something that is part of our ongoing thoughts about how do we continue to see the active view of our portfolio. But there is nothing today that I would say that we will be announcing. Andre, anything else you would add?\nAndre Maciel: No, I think that\u2019s consistent with what we have said before. I think our priority is organic business and M&A. If it happens, it has to help us accelerate our organic strategy, essentially be fully consistent, like we have done less for acquisitions or sales elevation and pre-opting in emerging markets and to be accretive to our top line, bolt-on on top of acquisitions. That\u2019s what we are focusing on.\nJason English: Understood. Thank you very much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. You may proceed.\nMatt Smith: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question. Your productivity savings have been very strong this year, and you already increased your target for the year. Those have in part been used to have a stepped-up level of investment behind marketing, R&D and innovation. But as we look forward, can you sustain this level of incremental savings into 2024, or should we expect a return to the target of $500 million? And after this year has stepped up investment, do you believe you are exiting with the appropriate level of investment across the business, or do you plan to continue to invest in an elevated rate as we look forward?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Maybe, Andre, if you could speak to our efficiency plans?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So look, at this point, we are still committed to deliver the 3% of COGS of $500 million on a go-forward basis. But as we have said before, our benchmark is really on the 4% level, which we are achieving this year. And you should keep in mind that this year as well, we had a lot of, let\u2019s call, gettables from inefficiency that was generated from the pandemic, that\u2019s also helping. But we feel good about how our supply chain organization today is operating at completely superior level with very stable service levels and being a lot more forward thinking, which gives us confidence in delivering that 3% that we have talked before. From an investment standpoint, I think this also has been a great year because we have been able to deliver very solid bottom line growth while really resetting the investment level from the company for the future, which means that I think a lot of the reset has happened. There are still places that we want to invest more. But I think we took advantage of this year to really reset the level of investments to a very good level.\nMatt Smith: Thank you, Carlos and thank you, Andre.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, this will be the last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed. Robert Moskow, your line is now open.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Can you hear me now?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes.\nRobert Moskow: Sorry about that. So, this is kind of a what-if question, and maybe you might not want to ask \u2013 answer what-if questions. But we are all watching top line growth kind of decelerate in the U.S., and the U.S. retail is such an important part of your mix. So, I guess my question is, if we are in a scenario where we are kind of in a 0% to 1% kind of sales growth environment next year, just for your categories, what would your philosophy be on an EBITDA basis? Like would you still drive to drop savings to the bottom line to hit the mid-single digit EBITDA, or would a slower top-line environment necessitate a slower EBITDA growth kind of target?\nAndre Maciel: Okay. Good morning, Rob, and good to hear back from you. Look, we believe that for us to grow top line in a profitable sustainable way is critical. So, if in an event where industry is zero, I think that doesn\u2019t change the game that we are trying to play. Because I don\u2019t know if you are implying that we will start to go aggressive on promotions to try to get volume through market share in a productive and sustainable way. If that\u2019s what you are asking behind your question, that\u2019s not the game we are going to play. So, I will just say that our strategy continues to be the same, it\u2019s working. And I think we feel that\u2019s heading in the right direction. We don\u2019t want to make a change in direction because of temporary situations in the industry.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks Robert.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Carlos Abrams-Rivera for any closing remarks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you. So, before we leave here, I just wanted to acknowledge and take a moment to thank Miguel for all the support and trust that he has shown to me personally and for everything he has done for a company as he has built this tremendous and strong foundation. I can tell you that today, Kraft Heinz is a much stronger company because in 2019, Miguel Patricio put this company on his back and carried it forward. And I am forever grateful for being part of his team as we all work together to transform Kraft Heinz. And as I take over as the next CEO of Kraft Heinz, I am proud of where we have been as a company and even more thrilled about where we are going. And thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

And before opening the call for questions, I just would like to thank Kraft Heinz, my entire team for another great quarter. And again, I would like just to highlight some positive aspects about this quarter. We are generating accelerated profitable growth fueled by our three pillars. Our share and volume trends are improving as a result of the action plans that we are implementing. And we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, hitting our target net leverage of approximately 3x. And then we continue to invest in the future with another quarter of significant investments in marketing, technology and R&D. Well, with that, I have here with me today, Andre and Carlos. And so, let's open the call for the Q&A."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "I will just add that in our long-term algorithm, volume is important to us. So in our 2%, 3% growth, it comes from a balanced contribution between price and volumes or volumes there, but as Carlos said, we are seeking profitable volume growth. We are not trying to maximize gross percentage margin, we are trying to deliver profitable, sustainable growth, ultimately translating to sustainable EPS growth. Thanks for your question. Sure. So as we have said before, different parts of our portfolio, they have different roles, and these roles might change over time. The role for me right now is to rebuild the profitability which has enrolled at 50% in the last 5 years while continuing to invest in the brands to improve, innovate, so then at some point, this brand can be in a position to grow in a profitable way again. And that's what we're doing. In Q3, for the second quarter in a row, this part of the portfolio, declined mid to high single digits on the top line but grew mid to high single digits on the bottom line, not by milking the brand, but by making the type of \u2013 the right type of investment and the right type of actions that are appropriate for this portfolio right now. For us to be chasing volume with this in an unsustainable way, only through promotion, that's not the game that this \u2013 that we want this brand to play. Sure. So on capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. That means continue to fund our very competitive dividend, maintain investment grade and prioritizing organic growth like we have been consistently doing during the past 3, 4 years. We are very proud that we were able to get to this level of leverage 1-year ahead of our initial expectation, and that's very important. That shows that the business is strong and the organization is focused on delivering sustainable performance not only on the EBITDA side, but also in cash conversion, which is a remarkable improvement of this organization. And now I think that puts us in a very good situation to assess options to deploy this cash, and we are looking at those. Yes, we did. And that's the case. Nothing changes. So nothing changed in terms of volume expectations as Carlos said. So we said, and it happened that volume would improve in Q3 sequentially to Q2, and it did. It improved in Q4 versus Q3. And at some point in 2024, the volumes will turn positive. I am not going to give guidance for 2024 right now. What I just said is what we have been saying all along. No, I think that's consistent with what we have said before. I think our priority is organic business and M&A. If it happens, it has to help us accelerate our organic strategy, essentially be fully consistent, like we have done less for acquisitions or sales elevation and pre-opting in emerging markets and to be accretive to our top line, bolt-on on top of acquisitions. That's what we are focusing on. Sure. So look, at this point, we are still committed to deliver the 3% of COGS of $500 million on a go-forward basis. But as we have said before, our benchmark is really on the 4% level, which we are achieving this year. And you should keep in mind that this year as well, we had a lot of, let's call, gettables from inefficiency that was generated from the pandemic, that's also helping. But we feel good about how our supply chain organization today is operating at completely superior level with very stable service levels and being a lot more forward thinking, which gives us confidence in delivering that 3% that we have talked before. From an investment standpoint, I think this also has been a great year because we have been able to deliver very solid bottom line growth while really resetting the investment level from the company for the future, which means that I think a lot of the reset has happened. There are still places that we want to invest more. But I think we took advantage of this year to really reset the level of investments to a very good level. Okay. Good morning, Rob, and good to hear back from you. Look, we believe that for us to grow top line in a profitable sustainable way is critical. So, if in an event where industry is zero, I think that doesn't change the game that we are trying to play. Because I don't know if you are implying that we will start to go aggressive on promotions to try to get volume through market share in a productive and sustainable way. If that's what you are asking behind your question, that's not the game we are going to play. So, I will just say that our strategy continues to be the same, it's working. And I think we feel that's heading in the right direction. We don't want to make a change in direction because of temporary situations in the industry."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. It's Carlos. Let me first address your point about clarification. What you see in the page, it is about those branded players that do compete with Kraft Heinz. The second part in terms of how do we think about our promotions as we go forward. First, I will tell you that I'm not going to comment on what other companies may or may not do. But I will tell you is that, one, we're not going back to 2019 levels. We are going to \u2013 at the same time, as we go forward into Q4, we know there is a seasonality to our business. And as we have said earlier, we're going to make sure now as we go into the holiday season, that we make the right investments to support our business. Now I'll say that at the same time, we're going to continue with the same level of discipline that we have shown until now to make sure that our investment with the right level of ROI as we go forward. Thanks for the question Andrew. First of all, I think that \u2013 let me just put into context kind of the volume question that you see in North America. First, I would say is that what you see for us as a company, we continue to improve sequentially from what you saw in Q3 \u2013 I'm sorry, Q2 to now in Q2 \u2013 in Q3. And then, if I look holistically at the company first, you'll see that we continue to drive the things that are working for us. We are continuing to grow in Emerging Markets where we're growing volume mix year-over-year now in Q3, that we continue to expand in our Foodservice and that we believe that it continues to drive opportunity as we go forward. And then specifically in the U.S. business, you see how the investment we have made in terms of improving our share of shelf, our investments in marketing, our investing in innovation and our improvement in CFR have continued to improve overall actions. Now as we think about the total portfolio, there are some places in which we're going to remain focused and disciplined on how we invest back into the business. I think you referred to in our meat business, where we want to make sure that we are not going to be just following unprofitable growth, but that we're going to be rational and disciplined on how we invest in those businesses in order for us to drive the right consumer pull, but at the same time, not sacrificing the overall profitability of the business that we need to maintain. Andre, why don't you start here, and I can build. The only thing I would add is that even in \u2013 if you think about our cold cut business within our meat business, we have continued to improve our CFR, but that is the one area where we're still not at the right level of service that we want for the year. You'll see that progression. At the same time, as we have improved our service, we have also began to see improvement in our share, too. So if you look at month to date as well through October, we are seeing that, in fact, our cold cuts business are beginning to gain share. So we are just going to be looking at the category in a very disciplined way to make sure we're doing the right things, as Andre said. Fair questions, John. Thank you for the question, Stephen. Andre, why don't you comment on the capital allocation, then I'll talk about Foodservice and Emerging Markets. Thanks, Andre. Let me comment first on Foodservice. I feel very optimistic about our plans in Foodservice. And we have really been working on building a foundation for the future. And if you think about the way we are thinking about building our business in basically three areas, we continue to make the investments in our chef-led models and that's driving positive performance for us. We also are making sure we are competing in more attractive and better margin channels, things like our independent and non-commercial channels versus traditional where we have been limited to. And then lastly, we are seeing much more powerful innovation that allows us to lever the technology investments we have made and bring those into the product forefront, whether that is in things like our Heinz Remix machines and how that actually creates an opportunity for us to separate ourselves for the future. Now if you look at the full year for Foodservice, our expectation is probably to grow somewhere in the low to mid double digits versus last year. And we are \u2013 I will point out that we're gaining share too, in both North America and the international zone. And then let me just make sure also that it's clear that if we think about our long-term algorithm, Foodservice is expected to grow about 5%, and we're going to be well above that level in 2023. Now if I switch over to our Emerging Markets, the one great thing that we also have been investing behind in Emerging Markets is kind of the discipline of our go-to-market model. And for us, the reason we feel so confident is because there is a data-driven go-to-market model that allows us to drive distribution, that then \u2013 we can then build and press in existing markets and enter new ones. And we have done that several locations. In fact, we are on track to implement our model in 90% of Emerging Markets by the end of this year. And just to remind you, in things like \u2013 in the first phase of building distribution, we would build the infrastructure, and then we go into the full structure in order to truly take advantage of our emerging business. I think in Emerging Markets, I would just add the comment that in Q3, we saw a temporary headwind as we think about particularly in Asia, where we have a business in Indonesia that is most surrounding around Ramadan season and where we saw some travel shifting \u2013 spending shifting from travel, away from gifting, and we have a gifting business in Indonesia. So that was that was a temporary thing. But as we think about the year ahead, we believe that we will get back to the right levels of performance also in our Indonesia business. Thanks for the question. In fact, I think everything that we're seeing right now in the market, in our actions are working. And it just gives us more confidence as we think about our 2024 plans. Yes. Good question. Happy to clarify, Michael. What I would say is that we need to make sure that we are responding to the moments in which consumers are going to be looking for the right solutions for whether it's at the holiday seasons or all the points throughout the year. And as we go into Q4, for example, we will make sure that we are making the right investments. However, we will be doing that with the right level of discipline to make sure we drive the right returns on that investment. So, the idea is that we have simply \u2013 like we stated earlier, we are not going to just be chasing volume, we are going to be looking for what is the way for us to drive profitable volume in a way that combines our ability to continue to build our businesses through the right investments in marketing and using the full array of revenue management tools in order for us to be able to drive the right efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. I think that would be one of the things that you could say. But I think on top of that, if you think about the full array of our revenue management tools, pricing, price architecture, other tools at our disposal that allows us to actually think about what is the right investments in order for us to maintain the level of \u2013 improving level of profitability that we have seen deteriorate over the last few years. Thank you. First of all, Jason, thank you for the kind words, and I am certainly very much humble and excited about the opportunity ahead for me and for the company. What I would say is that, as you pointed out, I have been sitting next to Miguel for the last almost 4 years now. And I think a number of things that we have done as a company, we certainly have done together. And strategically, I think that I am certainly committed to the three growth pillars that we have for going forward that is \u2013 and think about also how do we continue to drive our expansion in emerging markets, how do we continue to see foodservice as a great growth for us and then the growth platforms within our U.S. business. At the same time, you also probably read some of the changes we are making in our structure in order to actually help us accelerate some of those things that we have done. For me, one of the critical aspects of this time when I have been transitioning as \u2013 and coming to the new role in January, has been listening to the organization and making sure we have the clarity of our strategy. And our structure is going to follow that clarity. So, some of the things you will see in terms of us being able to have a bit of breaking down the international zone which has worked in the past well for us, but now as we go into a new way of us growing, allows us to be a little more focused on those emerging markets in which we are going to make some additional investments. That, I think is part of us thinking differently about how we bring that structure and so that strategy to life in our structure. So, that's I think some of the things that you are going to see, is what are the places that \u2013 with the lens of the jobs to be done for the strategy of the company, that we can maybe arrange certain things where we can truly leverage the scale of the company, the scale that we have been investing behind our technology and our marketing capabilities and to deploy them against the three pillars strategically that I am very much aligned with. As Andre said earlier, we continue to look at opportunities, but I would say that's something that is part of our ongoing thoughts about how do we continue to see the active view of our portfolio. But there is nothing today that I would say that we will be announcing. Andre, anything else you would add? Thank you, Jason. Maybe, Andre, if you could speak to our efficiency plans? Yes. Thanks Robert. Thank you. So, before we leave here, I just wanted to acknowledge and take a moment to thank Miguel for all the support and trust that he has shown to me personally and for everything he has done for a company as he has built this tremendous and strong foundation. I can tell you that today, Kraft Heinz is a much stronger company because in 2019, Miguel Patricio put this company on his back and carried it forward. And I am forever grateful for being part of his team as we all work together to transform Kraft Heinz. And as I take over as the next CEO of Kraft Heinz, I am proud of where we have been as a company and even more thrilled about where we are going. And thank you all for joining us today."

[Operator Instructions].  Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations. \nAnne-Marie Megela : Thank you and hello everyone! Welcome to our Q&A Session for our second quarter 2023 business update. During today's call we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business, plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today and actual results may differ materially due to risk and uncertainties.  Please see the cautionary statement and risk factors contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties.  Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com, under News & Events, for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I\u2019m going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio for some brief opening comments. \nMiguel Patricio : Well thank you Anne-Marie and thank you everyone. Thanks for joining us today.  Before opening the call for questions, I would like to thank the entire Kraft Heinz team. We have proven again that our strategy works, generating top-line growth fueled by the three pillars, while reinvesting margin gains into the business. But while we did lose share in the quarter, as price gaps have stayed wider for longer than we would have liked, we are managing the business for the long term and still generated mid-single-digit top-line growth within the range of what we expected.  As you may remember on the last earnings call, we introduced four action plans to drive share. We have seen those plans take hold, and they have led to improving results each month within the quarter, building momentum into the second half of the year.  The continued execution of these action plans and the lapping of last year's pricing are expected to drive improving volume trends in the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Our results give me continued confidence in our strategy and in our business, and I'm pleased to reiterate our full year guidance.  With that, I have Andre and Carlos joining me. Rafael [ph] is on a well-deserved vacation with his family, so let's open the call for Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed. \nAndrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. \nAndre Maciel: Good morning. \nMiguel Patricio: Good morning, Andrew. \nAndrew Lazar : I was hoping to dig into the promotional environment a little bit and some of the comments from your prepared remarks about branded competitors promoting at a higher level than Kraft Heinz.  In your view, are branded competitors either over promoting or promoting in what you see as sort of in a irrational way, or is it more that KHC has not been able to ramp up its own merchandising activity yet to the extent needed, given some of those supply constraints and leading over the pricing actions? I guess in other words, would you still expect the industry promotional levels to settle in below 19 levels or is there some concern building internally that competitive behavior could return to previous levels or beyond, and that pricing could actually go negative at some point? I\u2019m just trying to put some context around all of this. Thanks so much. \nMiguel Patricio: Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I will ask Carlos to answer, since I believe it's related to the U.S. retail. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera : Good morning, Andrew. You know the way that kind of I look at it is that if you look at the industry as a whole, today's promotional levels are as you said, still below 2019. What we are seeing is that our branded competitors are actually closer to those levels, and what we are working on is how do we continue to make sure that we act with a thought of protecting our margins and building the virtuous cycle as we continue to improve on our marketing, continue to improve our services, our innovation, and importantly that we stay focused on driving the revenue management needed in order for us to be rational in terms of the effectiveness of our promotions. So if you look at our promotions this year, we actually have been very effective and efficient. We actually are generating attractive ROIs in investments. I think the numbers right now are up 50 points versus 2019, and that's true because the focus that we have on those agile AI Driven Revenue Management Tools, that we are applying to making sure that every promotion does have that kind of true ROI return.  Now, on top of that, we're also making sure that we are working to maximize the opportunity on those promotions, so the quality of our merchandising, especially when you look at displays continue to improve, and in fact our share of displays continue to see increasingly improvements over the first quarter.  So I think all together what I would say is, our focus continues to be very much leveraging our revenue management tool, continue to focus and drive in the investments in terms of marketing innovation, which you will know will make sure that improve our view as we go into the second half of the year and on to 2024. \nAndrew Lazar : Great. I'll pass it on. Thank you. \nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Andrew. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed. \nKen Goldman : Hi, thanks. You mentioned that the second half's organic sales growth rate will be more in line with the long-term algo, not to put too fine a point on it, just so we can model more accurately. I was just curious, does this mean you expect it to be within that 2% to 3% range, that's your long-term algo or just getting somewhat closer to it? \nMiguel Patricio: Thank you, Ken. Andre please? \nAndre Maciel: Hi Ken. Good morning. As we have said in previous remarks, we expect to gradually go towards the long-term model. It might happen that we're going to reach there between Q3 and Q4, but you should expect like revenue to be gravitating towards that, yes. \nKen Goldman : Okay, I'll follow-up on that. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up about capital allocation priorities. Paying down debt is I think number three on that list, ahead of portfolio management. You highlighted that leverage is I guess more or less at your target. Does debt pay down thus move down a notch in importance, and I guess what I'm getting at is, is there a scenario in which you might, maybe start to buy back some stock again?\nAndre Maciel: Yes. Yes, we are not changing our capital allocation policy now. So as we said, our priority has been to fund the business organically and I think we have been doing that very consistently.  We \u2013 for us to maintain the dividends that we have, which provided a very attractive yield is critical and I think we feel good about our rating now, the level of the grade we had in the past 16 months.  M&A, as we said before continues to be something that we actively look at. We\u2019d like to \u2013 as we said in the remarks, we mentioned that multiple times, so we have been very disciplined in how we're doing that. But there is no change at this point. I mean we're always taking into consideration market dynamics and our capital structure, but we don't have anything new to say at this point. \nKen Goldman : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. You may proceed. \nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to stick with North America and the comments on promotions, but more so on delivery. Is there \u2013 Carlos, you highlighted the ROIs you're seeing and you touched on the quality promos a bit, but to dig inside a bit more deeply versus history, how are you seeing the lift sort of changing from quality promo programs, the feature, the display relative to the pre-inflation era?  Are you seeing a greater role for price reductions going forward? Does quality programs still have the same degree of lift in terms of the influence of those drivers? Just trying to get a sense for, as you lean into promo more in the back half and programming, does pricing need to be a larger driver at the margin than you would have thought relative to feature and display a couple of quarters ago? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: John, thanks for the question. I'll say, I think some of the parts were a little hard to understand, but I think I got the gist of your question. Related to the second half that we think about promotional level, and we have said this in final calls and within our guidance, there is a step up that we'll do in promotional levels as we go into the second half of the year in selected categories, but always with a disciplined approach of positive returns.  What I would add to is that, one of the things that we are able to do with our promotional investment to improve the effectiveness of those things, of that investment, is to make sure we level the entire portfolio and that we are thinking through how do we make sure we have the right product selection to the right audiences.  So for us, when you look at our, whether it's back to season, and we combine the different kind of categories that we can bring together, as we think about back to school in which we can bring in Lunchables and our Capri Sun business together, that idea of us being able to kind of go into the retail environment and actually leverage the entire scale of our business allows us to be more effective in terms of the returns of those promotions. So it's both, looking at the true ROI, through the AI management tools that we have, as well as maximizing our presence in store, leveraging our scale.  The last thing I will say is, as we think about going into the second half of the year, we're also seeing consumers behaving in a way, in two different kind of camps. They are the consumers who are going to be looking for those more, I would say larger packs in which they are going to look for the value by looking at the total size of the products that they are going to get and why we are introducing more products in the club type of packages, whether that is in our Mac and Cheese, in our Lunchables and you see that that is focused on driving that particular type of behavior with consumer effectiveness.  There's also going to be a number of programs specifically to making sure that we are keeping consumers who are also focused on the cash flow within our categories, which is why we also have been introducing more of the smaller package, more of the dollar type of products that allows us to maintain our consumers within the category for longer. So we're approaching that in those two prongs, at the same time, always looking at making sure we have the right ROI in every investment that we make. \nJohn Baumgartner: I apologize for my connection there, but just to clarify, if we think about price promotions versus sort of non-price, the quality, the feature, the display, have you seen any sort of changes in terms of how deep you may have to go on price reductions going forward or do you think that kind of quality promo, you'll still see attractive lift? You don't really have to get deeper on pricing. \nAndre Maciel: But what we have said Andre here, what we have seen throughout these past three years is that we can have very attractive lifts without having to go as deep. And I think that that, when you look across, at least based on data from my review [ph], that's what we have been observing for ourselves and I think that still remains true moving forward.  The other thing that as Carlos mentioned, that I think moving forward we're going to start to see more and more increasing importance of mix, and that's vis-a-vis only doing more promotions or playing with these prices. So I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about mix-related actions. \nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. Thanks for your time. \nMiguel Patricio: Thanks, John. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed. \nBryan Spillane : Hey, thanks operator. Good morning, everyone. \nMiguel Patricio: Good morning. \nBryan Spillane : Hi. So I had \u2013 I guess I had just two questions. First one, just a clarification. I think we talked about margins in the prepared remarks that fourth quarter margins will be higher than the third quarter. I just want to clarify, was that a comment on gross margin or EBITDA margin? \nMiguel Patricio: Andre?\nAndre Maciel: It ends up being both, but it's driven by the gross margin. \nBryan Spillane : Okay. \nAndre Maciel: And it's mostly, it's a seasonal factor, because in Q4 we typically sell-through. We're over-investing products in higher margins. If you look just for generality, aside [inaudible] Q2 is higher than Q3, because we ship a lot of greeting [ph] season, which has higher margin, we ship for summer. And then in Q4, we have items like cream cheese, gravies, and other items like that have very high margin, desserts. So that's why it's just mixed related. \nBryan Spillane : Okay. And then second question, and I guess maybe this is related to what John Baumgartner was just asking, but maybe just more simplistically, I think coming out of the first quarter, you talked \u2013 and this, we're talking about North American retail, that one of the issues or one of the drivers of share losses was just price gaps, right? That competitors, whether it's private label or branded in certain categories hadn't followed your pricing.  And so I guess I have two questions. One is, have price gaps narrowed or your share gains that you've seen sequentially over the last couple of months happened without the price gaps closing? And then when we think about your \u2013 the comments about the expectations for volume growth in \u201824, right, is that dependent also on kind of normalized price gaps? I guess what I'm trying to understand is like, can you drive volume without those price gaps closing, because you really can't control what your competitors do. \nAndre Maciel: Yes, I think there's a couple of things. If we look versus the bottom, the last two, three months we have seen the price gaps narrowly moving favorably to us, so getting closer. So there is certain contribution coming from that. And also, all the other actions that we outlined in the remarks, right. So we had to do some pockets of challenges in service that is now getting behind us. I think the only big remaining item is cold cuts. That as we said is going to be recovered by end of Q3 or the Q4. We have innovations starting to ramp up, and I think Carlos can give more color on that. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes Brian, what I would add is that, first of all on the comment on private label. Private label shares trends actually have been flat since you looked at it. In fact since second half of 2022, even with increasing price gaps that we had after our price impact in February. So we have taken that pricing to protect our margins, and some branded competitors have not followed, but at the same time, we continue to stay diligent on the way we think about the business. Now, in the points that Andrew just mentioned, in terms of \u2013 as we think about going forward, why is it that we see the moderation of our improvement? I'll give you three reasons on the way kind of I look at it as we go into the second half of the year into 2024 in the U.S. retails. You know number one, we're investing more in marketing, we're launching more innovation, and we are lapping the pricing actions as we go into second half of the year.  And just to unpack it one more level, if you think about the innovation that we are seeing right now, we are actually building momentum as we go into the year, as we are following this kind of two-pronged strategy innovation. First, you're going to see us continue to launch more disruptive innovation platforms, and that includes things like our NotCo line of plan-based offerings, the new Crisp from the Microwave, which delivers great taste and all the convenience, and the restaurant-to-retail platform, and you see that already with things like the IHOP\u00ae Coffee line.  The second part of the innovation is also how do we take our existing brands into new spaces. Already, we introduced a new frozen Mac and Cheese. We are expanding our Delimex and Taco Bell into more spaces with the Mexican meals, and as we speak, we're also launching new Oscar Mayer scramblers as we continue to expand on the Brexit platform.  So you see, it's comprehensive in terms of how we are approaching innovation in order to continue to shape the categories as we increase its shelf space and quality display as we go forward, and that's already paying us. And in fact, just to give you a factoid, if you look at our Lunchables, we are creating a new golden wall in Lunchables as we go into a second half, and we are seeing that in some of our top customers that increases about 40% our space within the shelf.  So again, it's not only thinking through the kind of promotional event, but also what we're doing in terms of our driving, volume-driving activities that are important as we go forward. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. \nPamela Kaufman : Hi! Good morning. \nMiguel Patricio: Good morning. \nAndre Maciel: Good morning. \nPamela Kaufman : In North America, you pointed to your organic sales growth below consumption in certain parts of the portfolio, like the GROW platform, Taste Elevation, Easy Meals. What's driving that gap, and are you seeing a change in how retailers are managing inventory levels or shelf space for your brands? \nMiguel Patricio: Let me start with the \u2013 thanks for the question. Let me start with the second part of that, which, what we're seeing right now is \u2013 if you look at the second quarter and what we know today, we believe retail inventory is actually in pretty good shape. In fact, on average, retail inventory for us was flat across the North America business, and what did happen, it was in truly isolated pockets and earlier in the quarter, so that we actually saw that through the quarter it continued to improve, and so there's no \u2013 I don't see that as an ongoing situation as we go forward and that has been proven as we go through the quarter, so.  And I'm sorry, the first part of your question then was what?\nPamela Kaufman : Why were your sales below consumption across some of your platforms? \nMiguel Patricio: Yes. No, thank you. You know, I think if you look at our GROW platforms, which continue to drive our priority and our strategy, those actually in consumption remain very strong. I think if you think about Taste Elevation growing 8% for the quarter, Easy Meals growing 6% in the quarter. In those cases, the difference between organic and our consumption were specifically in Easy Meals, where there was an inventory de-load in the beginning part of the quarter that as I said earlier, it continued to improve as we go into \u2013 as we go forward.  And I think for us is, that remains \u2013 our strategy remains \u2013 the fact that the consumption continued to improve as we go through the quarter and the performance we saw in those, I think supports our continued focus on that strategy as we go into the second half of the year. \nPamela Kaufman : Okay. Thank you. \nMiguel Patricio: Thank you. \nPamela Kaufman : And just a follow-up question on your outlook for volumes improving in the back half. You pointed to moderating pricing growth as one of the drivers, but in the second quarter, pricing already moved past its peak, although volumes still softened.  So why do you think that volumes will get better from here, considering the competitive environment and some of the macro headwinds you highlighted, like the student loan repayment resuming? And I guess just related to that, how much of a driver do you think that the innovation that you talked about can be for volumes? Thanks. \nAndre Maciel: Yes. Look, our price \u2013 our price in Q2 as you saw was close to 11%, and the reason why we saw higher elasticity and higher volume decline as I said before is because of the expanded price gaps. Now moving forward, these price gaps are not getting worse. If anything, they are slightly getting better. So as you head into the second half, as we continue to lap price, we still have valuable price that happened last year, so that you're going to be lapping starting now in Q3, and even we had another round that implemented Q4 last year. So we have two rounds of price still to lap in the United States alone.  So beyond the pricing side, there are other things linked to our action plans that will help us to step up the share level that we are at today. I think Carlos can speak about that. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The one thing I guess I would add to that too is that, if you think about innovation, it's not just kind of the launching innovation, but what the innovation allows you to actually perform in market. So when I mention things like us being able to improve our presence and expanding our shelving on things like Lunchables because of the innovation. And in Lunchables for example, we are going to new locations. So we're doing \u2013 already announced yesterday, we're doing pilots on taking Lunchables into the pro section; we're launching innovation in schools; we are expanding our presence in vending. All that actually helps us strengthen our overall kind of performance in stores.  We also are doing that in Philadelphia cream cheese. If you think about a year \u2013 a year ago, this is actually going to be the first holiday season in which we're going to go into the holidays with full service on Philadelphia cream cheese and that's true for the last several years. So now we have an opportunity to actually truly kind of leverage our power of our brand, make sure we build that kind of our shelf display, as we go into this one of the most important seasons for Philadelphia business.  And we also changed to that too in coffee. I mentioned earlier, the fact that we had a new line with IHOP in terms of bringing coffee, a new IHOP coffee into the stores. That actually allows us to also expand our coffee category into the stores and actually win additional spaces as we go into the second half of the year. So the innovation plays a couple of roles. It both attracts consumers and shapes our category to grow, but it also helps us expand our presence in order to increase the volume as well. \nAndre Maciel : So volume expected to improve as a function of lapping prices from last year. We still have two rounds to lap. Innovation ramping up. Shelf resets in the fall. That I think would be favorable to us, that's the expectation and service level recovery, particularly in cold cuts. \nPamela Kaufman : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Cody Ross with UBS. You may proceed. \nCody Ross : Hi. Thank you for taking our questions. I just want to focus on gross margin and specifically your inflation outlook. What's driving you to move your inflation outlook lower this year? \nAndre Maciel: So commodities in general continue to come down, and as hedges roll off and our contracts get adjusted, some of them are based on indexes. We are seeing costs continue to move favorably, which has been allowing us to expand the gross margin, and by consequence has been allowing us to accelerate the investment behind the business, particularly in marketing, R&D and technology. [Cross Talk]\nCody Ross : Any particular commodities? \nAndre Maciel: That are declining? \nCody Ross : Yes. That you would call out, that\u2019s driving that. \nAndre Maciel: I don't think there is a particular one. I mean our portfolio is large, there are so many commodities in the business. There is a general movement of commodities coming down. The exceptions to that sale are tomato, potato, that have bad crops, and sweetness. Other than that, we are seeing generally commodities moving favorably. \nCody Ross : Understood. And then in light of the declining commodities or your outlook for inflation, do you think you took too much price, given you said you took price ahead of competitors and they have not followed? And then I'll pass it on.\nAndre Maciel: No. I would say\u2026 \nMiguel Patricio: Let me answer that one. I would do everything again. We\u2019ve had very high inflation, and we are leaders in the vast majority of categories where we play, and it's our role as leaders to try to compensate these price increases with \u2013 this inflation with price increase. So I would do everything again. I mean, we can always go back on price if we think we have to or when we have to, but we had to lead price increases. So yes, that would be my answer to you. \nAndre Maciel: And the only thing I would say is remember that we never get to be very systematic in terms of pricing to offset the inflation, and that's what we have done. We have no price ahead of inflation. If you look at our gross margin in Q2, it's still slightly below 2021 levels.  And the other thing that is worth mentioning in the gross margin, we showed that in prepared remarks. Our efficiency plan is trending very well, and we are ahead of \u2013 we are pacing ahead of the $500 million that we have said we\u2019ll deliver by the year, so another good news. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me build on that point from Andre. I think that the only sustainable way to keep increasing our investments behind the brand and to grow our volumes and shares for the future is by improving gross margins and investing back in marketing, R&D and technology, which is exactly what we are doing.  Because we had very high, very good gross margin this quarter, we could increase marketing this quarter by 23%. We could increase R&D by 10%. We could increase our investments in technology. And as Andre said, that was possible because in one side, yes, we had price increases, but on the other side, because we are every month delivering more and more efficiencies in supply, we're excited with that part as well and that's my answer. \nAndre Maciel : And I expect that people noted the difference as well, how they are operating, because we have been intentionally opting to use those resources, to put back in the long term behind marketing and technology. We could have opted to be adding more promotions, but that would not make sense, because we\u2019d be adding promotions to low return. We are thinking about the long term here. I hope people note the difference of how they are being \u2013 they are getting the big base very different.\nAnne-Marie Megela : And that will wrap it up for today's Q&A session. Thank you all for your questions. I will turn it over to Miguel, who will just kind of wrap up the call for us. \nMiguel Patricio: I just want to thank you all for the time and for the attention and the patience with us. So thank you so much, and hope to talk to you and to see you very soon. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Well thank you Anne-Marie and thank you everyone. Thanks for joining us today.  Before opening the call for questions, I would like to thank the entire Kraft Heinz team. We have proven again that our strategy works, generating top-line growth fueled by the three pillars, while reinvesting margin gains into the business. But while we did lose share in the quarter, as price gaps have stayed wider for longer than we would have liked, we are managing the business for the long term and still generated mid-single-digit top-line growth within the range of what we expected.  As you may remember on the last earnings call, we introduced four action plans to drive share. We have seen those plans take hold, and they have led to improving results each month within the quarter, building momentum into the second half of the year.  The continued execution of these action plans and the lapping of last year's pricing are expected to drive improving volume trends in the second half of 2023 and into 2024. Our results give me continued confidence in our strategy and in our business, and I'm pleased to reiterate our full year guidance.  With that, I have Andre and Carlos joining me. Rafael [ph] is on a well-deserved vacation with his family, so let's open the call for Q&A. Good morning, Andrew. Good morning, Andrew. Thanks for the question. I will ask Carlos to answer, since I believe it's related to the U.S. retail. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Ken. Andre please? Thanks, John. Good morning. Andre? Good morning.

            "content": "Good morning. Hi Ken. Good morning. As we have said in previous remarks, we expect to gradually go towards the long-term model. It might happen that we're going to reach there between Q3 and Q4, but you should expect like revenue to be gravitating towards that, yes. Yes. Yes, we are not changing our capital allocation policy now. So as we said, our priority has been to fund the business organically and I think we have been doing that very consistently.  We \u2013 for us to maintain the dividends that we have, which provided a very attractive yield is critical and I think we feel good about our rating now, the level of the grade we had in the past 16 months.  M&A, as we said before continues to be something that we actively look at. We'd like to \u2013 as we said in the remarks, we mentioned that multiple times, so we have been very disciplined in how we're doing that. But there is no change at this point. I mean we're always taking into consideration market dynamics and our capital structure, but we don't have anything new to say at this point. But what we have said Andre here, what we have seen throughout these past three years is that we can have very attractive lifts without having to go as deep. And I think that that, when you look across, at least based on data from my review [ph], that's what we have been observing for ourselves and I think that still remains true moving forward.  The other thing that as Carlos mentioned, that I think moving forward we're going to start to see more and more increasing importance of mix, and that's vis-a-vis only doing more promotions or playing with these prices. So I think we're going to be hearing a lot more about mix-related actions. It ends up being both, but it's driven by the gross margin. And it's mostly, it's a seasonal factor, because in Q4 we typically sell-through. We're over-investing products in higher margins. If you look just for generality, aside [inaudible] Q2 is higher than Q3, because we ship a lot of greeting [ph] season, which has higher margin, we ship for summer. And then in Q4, we have items like cream cheese, gravies, and other items like that have very high margin, desserts. So that's why it's just mixed related. Yes, I think there's a couple of things. If we look versus the bottom, the last two, three months we have seen the price gaps narrowly moving favorably to us, so getting closer. So there is certain contribution coming from that. And also, all the other actions that we outlined in the remarks, right. So we had to do some pockets of challenges in service that is now getting behind us. I think the only big remaining item is cold cuts. That as we said is going to be recovered by end of Q3 or the Q4. We have innovations starting to ramp up, and I think Carlos can give more color on that. Good morning. Yes. Look, our price \u2013 our price in Q2 as you saw was close to 11%, and the reason why we saw higher elasticity and higher volume decline as I said before is because of the expanded price gaps. Now moving forward, these price gaps are not getting worse. If anything, they are slightly getting better. So as you head into the second half, as we continue to lap price, we still have valuable price that happened last year, so that you're going to be lapping starting now in Q3, and even we had another round that implemented Q4 last year. So we have two rounds of price still to lap in the United States alone.  So beyond the pricing side, there are other things linked to our action plans that will help us to step up the share level that we are at today. I think Carlos can speak about that.

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. You know the way that kind of I look at it is that if you look at the industry as a whole, today's promotional levels are as you said, still below 2019. What we are seeing is that our branded competitors are actually closer to those levels, and what we are working on is how do we continue to make sure that we act with a thought of protecting our margins and building the virtuous cycle as we continue to improve on our marketing, continue to improve our services, our innovation, and importantly that we stay focused on driving the revenue management needed in order for us to be rational in terms of the effectiveness of our promotions. So if you look at our promotions this year, we actually have been very effective and efficient. We actually are generating attractive ROIs in investments. I think the numbers right now are up 50 points versus 2019, and that's true because the focus that we have on those agile AI Driven Revenue Management Tools, that we are applying to making sure that every promotion does have that kind of true ROI return.  Now, on top of that, we're also making sure that we are working to maximize the opportunity on those promotions, so the quality of our merchandising, especially when you look at displays continue to improve, and in fact our share of displays continue to see increasingly improvements over the first quarter.  So I think all together what I would say is, our focus continues to be very much leveraging our revenue management tool, continue to focus and drive in the investments in terms of marketing innovation, which you will know will make sure that improve our view as we go into the second half of the year and on to 2024. John, thanks for the question. I'll say, I think some of the parts were a little hard to understand, but I think I got the gist of your question. Related to the second half that we think about promotional level, and we have said this in final calls and within our guidance, there is a step up that we'll do in promotional levels as we go into the second half of the year in selected categories, but always with a disciplined approach of positive returns.  What I would add to is that, one of the things that we are able to do with our promotional investment to improve the effectiveness of those things, of that investment, is to make sure we level the entire portfolio and that we are thinking through how do we make sure we have the right product selection to the right audiences.  So for us, when you look at our, whether it's back to season, and we combine the different kind of categories that we can bring together, as we think about back to school in which we can bring in Lunchables and our Capri Sun business together, that idea of us being able to kind of go into the retail environment and actually leverage the entire scale of our business allows us to be more effective in terms of the returns of those promotions. So it's both, looking at the true ROI, through the AI management tools that we have, as well as maximizing our presence in store, leveraging our scale.  The last thing I will say is, as we think about going into the second half of the year, we're also seeing consumers behaving in a way, in two different kind of camps. They are the consumers who are going to be looking for those more, I would say larger packs in which they are going to look for the value by looking at the total size of the products that they are going to get and why we are introducing more products in the club type of packages, whether that is in our Mac and Cheese, in our Lunchables and you see that that is focused on driving that particular type of behavior with consumer effectiveness.  There's also going to be a number of programs specifically to making sure that we are keeping consumers who are also focused on the cash flow within our categories, which is why we also have been introducing more of the smaller package, more of the dollar type of products that allows us to maintain our consumers within the category for longer. So we're approaching that in those two prongs, at the same time, always looking at making sure we have the right ROI in every investment that we make. Yes Brian, what I would add is that, first of all on the comment on private label. Private label shares trends actually have been flat since you looked at it. In fact since second half of 2022, even with increasing price gaps that we had after our price impact in February. So we have taken that pricing to protect our margins, and some branded competitors have not followed, but at the same time, we continue to stay diligent on the way we think about the business. Now, in the points that Andrew just mentioned, in terms of \u2013 as we think about going forward, why is it that we see the moderation of our improvement? I'll give you three reasons on the way kind of I look at it as we go into the second half of the year into 2024 in the U.S. retails. You know number one, we're investing more in marketing, we're launching more innovation, and we are lapping the pricing actions as we go into second half of the year.  And just to unpack it one more level, if you think about the innovation that we are seeing right now, we are actually building momentum as we go into the year, as we are following this kind of two-pronged strategy innovation. First, you're going to see us continue to launch more disruptive innovation platforms, and that includes things like our NotCo line of plan-based offerings, the new Crisp from the Microwave, which delivers great taste and all the convenience, and the restaurant-to-retail platform, and you see that already with things like the IHOP\u00ae Coffee line.  The second part of the innovation is also how do we take our existing brands into new spaces. Already, we introduced a new frozen Mac and Cheese. We are expanding our Delimex and Taco Bell into more spaces with the Mexican meals, and as we speak, we're also launching new Oscar Mayer scramblers as we continue to expand on the Brexit platform.  So you see, it's comprehensive in terms of how we are approaching innovation in order to continue to shape the categories as we increase its shelf space and quality display as we go forward, and that's already paying us. And in fact, just to give you a factoid, if you look at our Lunchables, we are creating a new golden wall in Lunchables as we go into a second half, and we are seeing that in some of our top customers that increases about 40% our space within the shelf.  So again, it's not only thinking through the kind of promotional event, but also what we're doing in terms of our driving, volume-driving activities that are important as we go forward. The one thing I guess I would add to that too is that, if you think about innovation, it's not just kind of the launching innovation, but what the innovation allows you to actually perform in market.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations. The floor is yours.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone, and welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2023 business update. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com, under News and Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. Before we begin, I'm going to hand it over to our CEO, Miguel Patricio, for some brief opening comments.\nMiguel Patricio: Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, joining us today. We are proud, proud and confident. We are so confident that we are raising our guidance on EBITDA and earnings. We are so confident that we are increasing our investments in marketing and in R&D by $100 million to $150 million versus budget, which represents a solid double-digit growth versus previous year. These results are not a coincidence. They are because of our confidence. We have been consistently saying that we'll grow through emerging markets, and we grew 23% this quarter. We'll grow throughput service globally, and we grew about 29% this quarter, and we'll grow through our priority growth platforms in U.S., Easy Meals and Taste Elevation, where we had double-digit growth. The rest of the portfolio has to free up resources to invest in our strategy. These results are possible not only because of our strategy, but because of everything that is behind our strategy. Let me start with people. Today, we have a great team and very engaged team. Speed. Well, agility is a big word for us and the products that we have in place are transforming the company. In innovation, in supply, manufacturing, procurement, in sales, in logistics. And two good examples of that is innovation, where we have now a much stronger pipeline for the future and we reduced the time of innovating from three years to a couple of months, or in supply that through the pods plus the partnership with Microsoft and the usage of artificial intelligence, we are improving our planning, our service levels, reducing waste, reducing times. We are in a very different place today. And finally, efficiencies. When we announced 3 years ago, a $2 billion in 5 years of gross savings, there were a lot of people that were skeptical that represented $400 million per year. We not only delivered this number in 3 years in a row, but we are now increasing this bar to $500 million a year. With that, I have here with me today, Andre, our CFO; Carlos Abrams-Rivera, our Zone President for North America; and Rafael, our Zone President for International that are joining me. Please, we are ready for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nBryan Spillane: I just wanted to ask, I guess, two questions related to the U.S. One is, I think as we kind of strip out the foodservice piece and look at what's underneath, it looks like there's a bit of a dismatch or mismatch, I should say, between kind of what we were seeing in the Nielsen data and what would have been reported underlying. So just trying to understand if there was anything there relative to timing of shipments or promotions that might have affected the cadence? And then, second, if you can just talk a little bit about in the U.S. specifically, kind of how you're seeing the promotional activity or the promotional environment as we kind of head into some of the big summer holidays? Is it intensified? Is it kind of in line with your expectations. Just kind of how you're seeing those summer holiday setup, please?\nMiguel Patricio: Andre, please.\nAndre Maciel: Look, when you look at the U.S. performance, I don't think there is nothing out of the normal happening in the quarter. The inventory load was immaterial given where already ended at the end of Q4, as we said before. So it's really a function of the sell-out and the foodservice, which performed very well in the quarter in the U.S. zone. So maybe people underappreciated a little bit of impact of that. I believe it has something to do also the fact that last year, with Omicron and things, everything was shut down. So that impacted the sellout in retail across in the industry at the beginning of the quarter, but also helped a lot of foodservice to have a very strong performance. When it comes to promotions. As we have said all along - well, it has all along, we expect an increasing promotional year to go. That's what has been in the guidance to the plan from the beginning, so nothing changing there from that regard. Obviously, not prudent way and always emphasizing that well for 2019 levels. And you see in remarks [ph], how well we are doing in terms of continuing to improve our ROI with the tools that we have in place. And so I will give some color to pass over to Carlos to give some color on the promotional environment.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The one thing I guess I would add, Bryan, to what Andre just said is, as you mentioned, the ROI has continued to improve. But let me give you a little more color as to what's behind that. We have spoken about the agile scale and how that has reengineered kind of Kraft Heinz. And part of that is us creating ownable agile revenue management tools that actually allows us to improve the returns of our promotions. So like, for example, we have a trade management system that we created in-house, and it gives us real-time access to essentially over 10,000 promotional events. And then what we do is, we actually create digital tools that leverage that large amount of data to provide insights and recommendations in a very simple way. Now those solutions then help us to make sure that allows us to figure out what is the right depth of discount, what is the right time of the year and what are the right promotional tactics we have been doing. So if you look at our Q1 numbers, we saw about a 10-point improvement in ROI in this particular quarter versus what we saw a year ago. And it's about 15 points if you compare that to 2019 of Q1. So again, our ownable tools continue to help us make sure that we are driving that investment. So as we go forward, our continued focus is make sure that we invest in the business that we are focused on the renovation of our business and marketing, driving a stronger quality with those event-based activities that really have the high ROIs. And Raf, I don't know if anything you want to comment on what you're seeing in international promotions?\nRafael Oliveira: It's not very different than what you described Carlos. I think, and what Andre mentioned, you might see a bit of an increase. We will see a bit of an increase in some marketing and promotional activity through the year to go, but nothing significant that is not included in our guidance.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. One moment for the next, and it comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: I think you outperformed expectations, obviously, in the first quarter on organic sales growth and maintained the full year outlook, I guess, potentially implying slower go-forward trends maybe than originally planned for. Is there something you're seeing in the market that necessitates this adjustment? Or is this more a function of sort of conservatism? And I appreciate the fair outlook is already above your sort of long-term algorithm?\nMiguel Patricio: Andre, maybe you want to answer that question.\nAndre Maciel: So there is nothing that changed expectation. We are holding the guidance in top line. And if I look at versus what I believe market was expecting, we over delivered quite a lot in the international zone, which I think people still -- they don't fully appreciate the impact of emerging markets growth in our portfolio and the food service portion of the international market on portfolio as well. They've been performing extremely well, as Miguel indicated and they continue to do. So momentum is very solid. When it comes to the U.S., nothing changes in our internal expectations. We just see that at this moment is good to be prudent. It isn't macroeconomic uncertainties about interest rates and our consumers might expand on that, but nothing special.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nKen Goldman: There's been some anecdotal evidence that consumers are beginning to trade down in terms of where they're doing their grocery shopping, either going from premium channel to more mainstream or mainstream to discount. I'm curious if this is something you're starting to see as well, even if it's just on the margin. And if so, is it in any way, I guess, informing your decisions about product mix, new products, things like that?\nMiguel Patricio: Maybe Andre and Carlos can comment.\nAndre Maciel: So as you have seen since last year, the channel migration has started. So we don't see like a normal accelerated trend over that. We have seen consistently now for several months, there's the other channel and the mass merchandising gaining ground consistently. And as this is not a new phenomenon, we have been prepared for that for a while. So I'll pass to Carlos to talk about the panel activities we are doing in those channels, but we don't see anything abnormal happening. If anything, it's expected.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. What I would add in terms of color, I guess, first in retail, I mean there have been some channel shifting which we expected. And for the lower-income consumers, this means kind of moving to more value-focused retailers or into dollar channel. And as Andre said, we anticipated this. Now for high-income consumer, that also means thinking about what are the places that it can go in instead of maybe the specialty retailers to more traditional grocery and club. And for us, what we're looking to do is actually making sure that we have the right solutions for those that are respective channels. So whether that is more club size packagings and brands like Mac & Cheese and JELL-O and adding more dollar SKUs, so that consumers who are stretched are actually able to stay within the category. And then, as we talked earlier, being savvy about how we go about our promotional activities in certain categories so that we can, in fact, be there with consumers with the right overall kind of meal solution. So if you think about what a grilled cheese sandwich can do with Kraft singles, what Kraft Mac & Cheese can do in terms of families, what else [kind of] [ph] others can do, us being able to be there for those kind of meal solutions is part of the answer as well. The one other thing I would say is, if you look at that same channel shift within foodservice, we're also making sure that we are adjusting, too, for that. We are seeing how our business continues to grow in QSR and for us is continued to grow that business. And we are doing that and we're growing share of that business as well. So it's making sure that our consumers are shifting to from certain restaurants to QSR. We are making sure that we are there for them too, to continue to drive our products and continue to drive our growth, which is the way it resulted in Q1. So thank you for the question, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nJason English: Two quick questions. First, the gross margin outlook for the year. Great to see it moving up. It implies that your gross margin for the year is going to look a lot like your first quarter, which would, of course, market end to what has been like a sequential build with every quarter moving higher. I guess my question is, why would that be the case, especially given the cost inflation appears to be moderating.\nAndre Maciel: Sorry, Jason, could you repeat the question talking about the trajectory of the gross margin throughout the year?\nJason English: Yes. Gross margin has been building sequentially, right? You did have a chart in one of your slides showing every quarter moving higher. Your full year guidance implies that it kind of goes sideways. So you're going to finish the year at a margin rate very comparable to the first quarter. So my question is, why shouldn't we expect it to continue to grind a little higher as cost inflation moderates?\nAndre Maciel: No, the gross margin, we've increased a little bit throughout the next quarter. So we should see Q4 will be the highest one. Q2 goes a little bit sideways that is a component of mix in our portfolio as well, given the type of products that sell more during Q1 and Q4 in comparison to last sold in December. But beyond that, no, because the costs are continued to ease. We put a lot of price in the middle of the quarter. So we have two reflection of that now in Q2. But remember as well, and then I'm going to talk to that something from next year, right? But no, the gross margin will gradually increase throughout the year. And expectation is a little bit because of product mix, which is not seasonality.\nJason English: Yes. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then free cash flow, can you tell us what your outlook is for the full year in terms of conversion or level, however you want to communicate that. And I know you talked about working inventory down. It built a lot last year, and obviously, there's still a heavy usage of cash again in the first quarter. How much of that do you think we can get back out over the course of this year? Or do we have to kind of bleed into next year before we can normalize those levels?\nAndre Maciel: Yes. So free cash flow, as we said last quarter, we expect this year to close in the 75% to 80% range, which is in line with our plan. We even talk about that in CAGNY. And then, we expect by 2025 to go up to 100%. This has to do mainly with the CapEx ramp-up that we have done this year and next year, which is close to 4% and then expect to wind down. Working capital was a drag last year and in Q1 was also a negative. We prioritized service-level recovery because I mean, the payback is obviously there. What I can tell you is we have a very robust plan, very robust plan to bring the inventory down to level before. We have been working with buffers. I mean, as everybody in the industry does, given other circumstances about supply chain volatility and resilience. But we have a very clear line of glide path to break it down throughout the year. So the expectation for inventory is to land the year at similar levels to very well the pre-pandemic level as a percentage of COGS.\nOperator: One moment for our next question, please. And it comes the from line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities.\nJohn Baumgartner: I wanted to come back to promotion in the U.S., Carlos. There were a few categories that drove the bulk of U.S. share loss in Q1. But I think those are also categories where your promotion levels really seem below branded competitors. So is it fair to isolate the share losses to reduce promo and lingering supply chain issues? Or are there other factors employed outside of promo and supply chain?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: No, John. I think there's a fair assessment. But I guess, let me start with the fact that as we think about growing the business, we have a very disciplined approach of how we're going to do that. So as Miguel mentioned, we're going to focus on our growth platforms and the growth they have in our portfolio. We're going to make sure we're building innovation that's disruptive and that we continue to adapt the core to the consumer trends, and we're going to manage the margin with efficiency to reinvest in the business with double-digit investments in marketing, technology and R&D. And as you said, there are a few kind of categories where we saw a slowdown. And let me remind you, too, that we took pricing in the middle of the quarter as we were catching up to margins. So if you think about a couple of those categories, let me highlight a couple of them. One, Kraft Cheese, for example We did see some supply chain challenges that we had in the quarter. Those are things that prevented us from really taking advantage of the eastern time period and in fact, we are now in a position that will be better off as we go into the year to go. Another one, I'll tell you with cold cuts in which we began the year with a low inventory situation in our business. And again, as we think about cold cuts by the end of the summer, we should be in a much better place in terms of complete supply in the overall business. So that sense of the short-term supply constraint -- well assessment of how we see the quarter as well. The one thing I would add too is that there are places where categories, we're simply not going to be chasing volume down. So if you think about bacon, it's a category that probably was about a point of headwind when you look at the data and consumer data, but we are simply not going to be chasing volume that is not profitable. So that gives you a sense about how kind of we're looking at business and what drove the first quarter.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. Thanks, Carlos. And on the international side, your categories, I guess, historically, your category has been pretty defensive in terms of demand or economic weakness. And I'm curious, if you're doing a lot of good things, ramping distribution, launching new products. But as you transform the business with growth in food service, the new sauces, the BEES partnership with ABI, how do you think about the marginal structure? Are these new outlets and products introducing greater volatility into the business? Or do they benefit you and that they reduce some of the impact of private label and price sensitivities in places like the U.K. and Europe. How do you think about the net resilience you're building outside the U.S.? Thank you.\nAndre Maciel: Rafael, do you want to answer that one?\nRafael Oliveira: Yes. Well, happy to. I think we need to differentiate a bit how we're growing in emerging markets and the developed markets across international. I think I mean, what you described probably applies a lot to the developed market because as you know, has been talking about, across emerging markets, we are growing significantly and the go-to-market and the opportunity having execution of this go-to-market has been significant and continues to be. On the developed market, I mean it's a mix. I mean we've been renovating our portfolio significantly in all the base specialty mentioned Europe. And then launching the products that have been incremental, not only in [indiscernible], Easy Meals category. Like those are the two platforms that we've been growing, especially the sauces of Taste Elevation. So this has been the focus. I mean right now is delivering the results that we expect and again, providing the gains that we need and the resources from the core and the innovation growth that comes from those introductions.\nAndre Maciel: And just to add to that, if you remember, again international zone, we have developed marketing by emerging markets, right, emerging markets, 10% of our business. We expect to grow double digits like we have been doing. As a decent plant about expanding distribution, but it has to be better in a profitable way. And you might have noticed in the prepared remarks that since we start to require from our emerging markets, a certain level of minimum ROIC or NDA, I think we're seeing a fairly healthy balance between top and bottom line. And we saw very significant gross margin expansion in emerging markets across the board in the quarter. And I think with expectation to continue to improve. So we feel very good at part of the investments that Miguel has said about $150 million, which is going across market, R&D, lead technology and in some cases, sales headcount. But in the case of the emerging markets, we are accelerating the go-to-market expansion. Again, we always keep our stability top of mind here. We don't want to grow without delivering levering returns. And on the developed markets, not only in the U.S. but also in selected countries in developed, we are using part of these incremental investments to restate marketing levels and accelerate in some cases the innovation agenda. So it's still very good because that allow us to continue to build the future growth of the company.\nMiguel Patricio: Let me mention one thing that you said that you mentioned that entering new categories with innovation, you're right. I mean we launched in U.K. Heinz pasta sauce. And in a couple of months, we achieved 7% share, and we continue growing. We just launched a vodka pasta sauce with Absolut that is being extremely successful in the market. But it's not only in Europe. I mean if you look at the profile of innovation that we are having right now in the U.S., it's very different from the past. In the past, we had a lot of innovation but really not incremental, it's very cannibalistic. I just think about what we've been launching, like NotCo that we are going to -- it's going to be national during the summertime. It's basically 80% incremental to the category or just spices that we just launched in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer, which is spices, which is a huge market where we don't play today. Our Tingly Ted's that we are launching globally throughout the year that is in hot sauces that is a pretty growing category that we will not play or even Kraft Mac & Cheese frozen that we are launching, that we are a leader with Kraft Mac & Cheese. We have a very strong portfolio of frozen, but we didn't have an option of Kraft Mac & Cheese frozen. And I can continue this list and tell you about Home Bake and increased Home microwave, really, really incremental innovation that will start to change the profile of innovation in our company.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. And the question comes from Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: I just wanted to follow up on the supply topic. It sounds like you've made good headway and have good visibility to improvements going forward. But I guess, just framing that, is there a way to think about what the supply challenges in the first quarter cost you? And then as you move forward with those supply bottlenecks resolved, do you kind of resume a more normal growth trajectory in those categories? Were those issues behind you? Do you accelerate ketchup over the next couple of quarters as you dig out of the hole? Or is it more prudent for us to think about a more gradual ramp of recovery, again, as those issues abate. Thank you.\nMiguel Patricio: Andre, maybe Carlos then.\nAndre Maciel: Look, we obviously expect as some of the solutions, [indiscernible] Carlos indicated, we expect over time to be review the inventory at the retailer and that should come together with some improvement in the top-line performance. But again, it's all compensated in our guidance here. Remember that our priority in the U.S. is to grow in the growth platforms. and the priority growth platform have performed very well in the first quarter, particularly Taste Elevation and Easy Meals. But we expect [indiscernible] to improve their performance all the year as those problems get behind us. In other categories like in meat, as Carlos also said, not necessarily we're going to be a strong acceleration in growth because we're also trying to be prudent about having the profitability there. So it's about having the right balance but yes.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Just a minute. Not much to add. What I would say is, we continue to see the improvement in service level. So just to give you a kind of a framework last year. I think at this time of the year, we were kind of in the mid-80s. In the mid-90s actually closer to the high levels of 90s, so as we exit the first quarter. So I feel like we do have a couple of categories that I mentioned earlier, where we had some isolated challenges. But overall, the business we are sectoring the right trajectory to continue to service the business the right way as we go forward.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, that will be it for the Q&A session. I'd like to turn it over to Miguel for some closing comments.\nMiguel Patricio: All right. I just want to thank you for the time you spent with us and looking forward to sharing more information and more results with you. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, we conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

We are so confident that we are raising our guidance on EBITDA and earnings. We are so confident that we are increasing our investments in marketing and in R&D by $100 million to $150 million versus budget, which represents a solid double-digit growth versus previous year. These results are not a coincidence. They are because of our confidence. We have been consistently saying that we'll grow through emerging markets, and we grew 23% this quarter. We'll grow throughput service globally, and we grew about 29% this quarter, and we'll grow through our priority growth platforms in U.S., Easy Meals and Taste Elevation, where we had double-digit growth. The rest of the portfolio has to free up resources to invest in our strategy. These results are possible not only because of our strategy, but because of everything that is behind our strategy.

In other categories like in meat, as Carlos also said, not necessarily we're going to be a strong acceleration in growth because we're also trying to be prudent about having the profitability there. So it's about having the right balance but yes."

            "content": "The one thing I guess I would add, Bryan, to what Andre just said is, as you mentioned, the ROI has continued to improve. But let me give you a little more color as to what's behind that. We have spoken about the agile scale and how that has reengineered kind of Kraft Heinz. And part of that is us creating ownable agile revenue management tools that actually allows us to improve the returns of our promotions. So like, for example, we have a trade management system that we created in-house, and it gives us real-time access to essentially over 10,000 promotional events. And then what we do is, we actually create digital tools that leverage that large amount of data to provide insights and recommendations in a very simple way. Now those solutions then help us to make sure that allows us to figure out what is the right depth of discount, what is the right time of the year and what are the right promotional tactics we have been doing. So if you look at our Q1 numbers, we saw about a 10-point improvement in ROI in this particular quarter versus what we saw a year ago. And it's about 15 points if you compare that to 2019 of Q1. So again, our ownable tools continue to help us make sure that we are driving that investment. So as we go forward, our continued focus is make sure that we invest in the business that we are focused on the renovation of our business and marketing, driving a stronger quality with those event-based activities that really have the high ROIs. And Raf, I don't know if anything you want to comment on what you're seeing in international promotions? Yes. What I would add in terms of color, I guess, first in retail, I mean there have been some channel shifting which we expected. And for the lower-income consumers, this means kind of moving to more value-focused retailers or into dollar channel. And as Andre said, we anticipated this. Now for high-income consumer, that also means thinking about what are the places that it can go in instead of maybe the specialty retailers to more traditional grocery and club. And for us, what we're looking to do is actually making sure that we have the right solutions for those that are respective channels. So whether that is more club size packagings and brands like Mac & Cheese and JELL-O and adding more dollar SKUs, so that consumers who are stretched are actually able to stay within the category. And then, as we talked earlier, being savvy about how we go about our promotional activities in certain categories so that we can, in fact, be there with consumers with the right overall kind of meal solution. So if you think about what a grilled cheese sandwich can do with Kraft singles, what Kraft Mac & Cheese can do in terms of families, what else [kind of] [ph] others can do, us being able to be there for those kind of meal solutions is part of the answer as well. The one other thing I would say is, if you look at that same channel shift within foodservice, we're also making sure that we are adjusting, too, for that. We are seeing how our business continues to grow in QSR and for us is continued to grow that business. And we are doing that and we're growing share of that business as well. So it's making sure that our consumers are shifting to from certain restaurants to QSR. We are making sure that we are there for them too, to continue to drive our products and continue to drive our growth, which is the way it resulted in Q1. So thank you for the question, Ken. No, John. I think there's a fair assessment. But I guess, let me start with the fact that as we think about growing the business, we have a very disciplined approach of how we're going to do that. So as Miguel mentioned, we're going to focus on our growth platforms and the growth they have in our portfolio. We're going to make sure we're building innovation that's disruptive and that we continue to adapt the core to the consumer trends, and we're going to manage the margin with efficiency to reinvest in the business with double-digit investments in marketing, technology and R&D. And as you said, there are a few kind of categories where we saw a slowdown. And let me remind you, too, that we took pricing in the middle of the quarter as we were catching up to margins. So if you think about a couple of those categories, let me highlight a couple of them. One, Kraft Cheese, for example We did see some supply chain challenges that we had in the quarter. Those are things that prevented us from really taking advantage of the eastern time period and in fact, we are now in a position that will be better off as we go into the year to go. Another one, I'll tell you with cold cuts in which we began the year with a low inventory situation in our business. And again, as we think about cold cuts by the end of the summer, we should be in a much better place in terms of complete supply in the overall business. So that sense of the short-term supply constraint -- well assessment of how we see the quarter as well. The one thing I would add too is that there are places where categories, we're simply not going to be chasing volume down. So if you think about bacon, it's a category that probably was about a point of headwind when you look at the data and consumer data, but we are simply not going to be chasing volume that is not profitable. So that gives you a sense about how kind of we're looking at business and what drove the first quarter. Just a minute. Not much to add. What I would say is, we continue to see the improvement in service level. So just to give you a kind of a framework last year. I think at this time of the year, we were kind of in the mid-80s. In the mid-90s actually closer to the high levels of 90s, so as we exit the first quarter. So I feel like we do have a couple of categories that I mentioned earlier, where we had some isolated challenges. But overall, the business we are sectoring the right trajectory to continue to service the business the right way as we go forward."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our Q&A session for our third quarter 2024 business update. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments, and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risk and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today\u2019s earnings release, which accompanies this call, as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today\u2019s earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com, under News and Events, for discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. I will now hand over -- I will now hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, for opening comments. Carlos, over to you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As we report our third quarter results, I first want to recognize the entire Kraft Heinz team for their continued dedication to making life delicious for our consumers. In today\u2019s uncertain environment, people are increasingly seeking value. Our commitment to serving them with our iconic brand remains unwavering. For our stockholders, our focus remains on executing against our strategic pillars, driving profitable growth and generating strong cash flow. Both Global Away From Home and Emerging Markets are growing and gaining momentum, and we are addressing areas for improvements in U.S. Retail. By maintaining a disciplined management approach and long-term perspective, we are able to navigate today\u2019s near-term volatility while generating strong cash flow and reinvesting in the business. We have the right strategy, we have amazing talent and competitive advantage culture. This gives me great confidence that we can drive consistent, long-term, profitable growth. And with that, I have Andre joining me. So, let\u2019s open the call for the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. You may proceed.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning.\nAndre Maciel: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. So, Carlos, I know initially, right, Kraft Heinz expected to return to sort of an on-algorithm pace in the latter part of this year. Your comments in the prepared remarks suggest you now don\u2019t expect to reach an on-algorithm pace during 2025. So, first, just to clarify, is that a comment on the totality of the year or you don\u2019t expect to hit your algorithm at any point during the year? And then as you diagnose the elongated recovery in U.S. Retail, how much of this is sort of execution-related or simply a consumer that has not yet fully adjusted their reference price points to the new levels and you having to sort of nudge them along a bit more than you might have initially thought? Thanks so much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Andrew. Let me start, and then maybe pass it off to Andre to give the details of how we see the impact of the long-term algorithm. I guess, first of all, I\u2019ll say, certainly, this year has been very different than I think many of us in the industry expected. So, I think, when we think about what we thought was going to be the exit versus what we see now, a number of circumstances have changed, but I think we are, frankly, better reacting to what the reality of the consumer, particularly in the U.S. and that has implications on long-term algorithms. So, I think, Andre, if you can just cover to that and then I can go back and talk about the execution aspect of your question.\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So, thanks for the question, Andrew. As you rightly pointed out, we do not expect at this moment to reach algo on any part of next year, and as we said in prepared remarks, we do expect Away From Home Globally and Emerging Markets to continue to improve and continue to grow, and we\u2019re going to see migrating closer and closer to the long-term algorithm. Emerging Markets continue to deliver volume growth that has been throughout the entire year and the pressure will be mostly concentrated on the U.S. Retail part of the business. We -- as Carlos said, I think, the industry dynamics this year did not go the way that we initially anticipated and we\u2019re exiting the year in a softer position, and we do expect, even though industry next year currently we expect should be in line with levels pre-pandemic, we do expect propensity to trade down, continue to be very elevated at similar, if not higher levels than what we have this year, which will continue to put pressure on share. The good thing about that is we remain very confident in what we\u2019re doing in our strategy for the long-term. We are being very disciplined in how we want to grow the business, for us it\u2019s critical to be focused on growing our base volume in a healthy way, better innovation, higher marketing, and being very prudent and surgical on where promotions make sense or not, and because the problem is very concentrated in four categories that represent the vast majority of the U.S. Retail challenge, some of them, as we have said in prior earnings, take a longer time to recover. You\u2019ve got Capri Sun, for example, where they did a firm renovation, as we have said, it takes time until the trial gets generated and the repeat happens. So we need to be prudent. We are confident in what we are doing, but there is a longer trajectory out there. And with that, for execution, Carlos going to say a few words?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. Let me just start by saying, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do feel like we have the right strategy, and frankly, if you look at our two out of our three strategic pillars for growth, they are working and gaining momentum. That also gives me quite a bit of confidence in terms of our ability to execute, and in fact, the reality is that we have also delivered consistent, best-in-class productivity levels for five conservative quarters about 4% of COGS. Again, our ability to execute shows up that way. And if you think about Away From Home, you think about the way that the year began and how we were able to navigate that storm and be able to gain momentum as we go into the second half, again, our ability to execute in that area. If I think about Emerging Markets, the fact that we are growing volume, we are gaining share, we are increasing retribution, again, our ability to drive execution in that area as well, too. So we have a number of things that I think are going well that give us the confidence and now we are also diagnosing kind of their specific areas in U.S. Retail that, frankly, we know what we have to address and we are going to be putting our entire company focus on making sure we make the right turnaround on those businesses. Thank you, Andrew.\nAndre Maciel: Thank you.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks for your thoughts. Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask about Lunchables. On the one hand, you are optimistic you can turn the brand around. I can certainly appreciate some of the challenges, and I guess, your upcoming efforts in a positive direction. On the other hand, you did take a pretty large charge today, which is related to Lunchables, and I guess, that does not really happen if there is an internal belief that the brand can fully come back. So, can you kind of walk us through how to balance -- I do not want to say it is an optimistic tone, but certainly you are encouraged about the ultimate path for Lunchables and how to balance that with the charge you took today and is it fair to say that that charge reflects your belief, I guess, that the brand may not ever return to what it once was? I guess that is the underlying question here.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yeah. Thank you, Ken. I appreciate the question. First of all, let me just be clear. Lunchables is a very important part of our business, and defending a number one market share is a top priority. Full stop. Now, we are expected to see gradual improvements, but at the same time, we also recognize where we are right now. And part of that, I would say, is the negative publicity that we receive from that misleading interest group appears to be lingering longer. Remember, this is a brand that is focused on families and kids, so rebuilding that trust just takes some time. At the same time, we are seeing some competitive entry coming into the category, and in particular, and again, this is only for this particular quarter, we are seeing -- we are managing a particular supplier ingredient issue that we know that is a short-term focus on. So let me, I guess more importantly, let me tell you what the things that we are doing to recover. First of all, we are continuing to invest to expand the category penetration in this changing competitive environment. We are expanding flavors and formats. We just introduced a new spicy nachos that is launching nationwide as we speak. We are reimagining how we think about value at the shelf. We actually launched a new campaign for both parents and kids as we go into the first half of 2025, and at the same time, we are investing to renovate our entire line as we go into the first half of next year. Now, beyond this, we are also pulling forward a brand growth system to deploy against Lunchables to make sure that we have brand superiority for now and the future. And just to make sure that we have the right kind of nomenclature, brand growth system, if you recall, is a repeatable global model for growing our brands. It is essentially a process to solve consumer pain points with superior products delivering a convenient way at the best value possible. So we are using the best brand growth system that we have developed against the opportunity for us to drive this brand into next year. So, as Andre said, some of the things do take some time. We recognize the moment right now is being more challenged because of the one challenge in this particular quarter, but we believe this is a brand that will continue to grow and continue to be a hugely important part of our portfolio.\nAndre Maciel: Just to add, regarding the charge, that is mostly a function of the decline that we are facing this year and the consequence of the allocated recoveries. So, when you do the cash flows, they land at a different spot because, remember, if you just look at Q3 alone, the sell-out of Lunchables is down about 15%. So, we -- as we expect the recovery to take longer and be gradual, that has an implication on that has resulted in the decline mostly.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you again.\nKen Goldman: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nPeter Galbo: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Good morning, Peter.\nPeter Galbo: Maybe to follow up there as it relates to Lunchables, if you could give us a bit more detail just on the ingredient supplier issue. I mean, I know certainly in Oscar Mayer, right, there\u2019s an overhang from kind of the Listeria outbreak in the category that\u2019s probably impacting Oscar Mayer sales. But is that having any sort of upstream impact into Lunchables as well and any detail there would be appreciated.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: No. What I would say is, if essentially one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill one particular ingredient and it actually impacts essentially one SKU of Lunchables, but it\u2019s an important one, and again, we impact to be limited this year. So this is creating a short-term shortage of that particular ingredient and it\u2019s affecting us mostly in this particular quarter in Q4. But we continue to see opportunity for us to kind of resolve this in the very near future and get us back to what we need as we go into first half 2025.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Okay.\nPeter Galbo: If I could sneak in a second one. Just on Spoonables, I think that was an addition in terms of one of the challenges. Andre, I think, in the past quarters you\u2019ve talked about, you thought it was kind of a pass-through issue on some of the raw materials that some of your competitors were seeing. But now it seems like maybe there\u2019s more of a brand problem or a product lingering issue. So maybe you can expand a bit on Spoonables, what changed in the quarter. Again, that\u2019s kind of been added to the list of headwinds?\nAndre Maciel: Yeah. Spoonable has been facing a soft sell-out now for several months. And as we said before, we believe it\u2019s not only, but mostly linked still to price gaps out there in the market. And we -- I don\u2019t think we have executed everything the way that we anticipated and that is work to do on that front. But we still see, versus historical levels, certain price gaps that are disadvantage. That\u2019s just where the issue should be.\nPeter Galbo: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Palmer with Citi. You may proceed.\nTom Palmer: Good morning and thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up quickly on 2025 assumptions. Oh, hi. Thanks. When you look at some of the challenged areas of your portfolio, I think for 2025, you said you\u2019re assuming better category performance, but assume continued trade down. So, I guess, to what extent do you see price adjustments as a way to address this continued trade down versus innovation and packaging, things like that?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Listen, I think for us, we know that the right way for us to continue to build our brands is by driving superior products with better marketing and making sure that we have a full value format for all consumers, which is why we have continued to drive innovation in our products while we continue to focus on expanded distribution, both in club channel, Dollar General, as well as continue to expand our distribution in omnichannel. So that\u2019s number one. I think the question behind your question might be in terms of us thinking through whether we need anything else that we need to do in terms of managing price. I guess, what I would tell you is that, there are moments in which it does make sense for us to promote more. What -- the way we think through it is, let\u2019s make sure we do that in the right consumer location that ultimately leads to better base growth for the brand. So we need to do that intentionally so that we have the right investments returned on those promotions so that we avoid areas like barking, hunting behavior that ultimately do not have real incremental sales for the brands. So -- but at the same time, there are good places where, in fact, we have promoted more and we see that it makes sense for us to continue to see positive returns. So areas like Mac & Cheese Cups in which we\u2019re driving significant growth as we are right now, making sure we have the right price gaps and the right kind of attractive starting price points in the category. Areas like Cool Whip, what we know can also lead to better base growth for the future. So it is a combination of, again, making sure we grow the brand, leveraging a brand growth system, focusing innovation, renovation, better marketing, and at the same time, be thoughtful about the places in which it makes sense for us to manage those price gaps in a way that leads to the base growth going forward.\nAndre Maciel: What I\u2019ll add is our long-term algorithm contemplates continuous gross margin expansion. We feel very confident and proud about what we have done on the supply chain efficiency side. We have now four consecutive years of very strong delivery coming from there and this year in particular is the highest ever for us. We feel confident about the pipeline to continue to sustain very good levels of productivity and this productivity is critical to allow us to reinvest in the business. As Carlos said, look, our priority is really on improved trends on the base volume. That volume that happens agnostic of promotions. That\u2019s 90% of food and beverage sales and people keep talking about promotions. The focus is base volume. And base volume, you do it to continue to innovate, bring the news to consumers, renovate the portfolio like we have been doing, do more and great marketing and that\u2019s what we want to do and that\u2019s what we continue to do. So our priority is there. So look, we\u2019re not going to talk in detail guidance of 2025. We\u2019re going to talk a lot about that in the next quarter. I think we\u2019ve said enough about 2025 to give you just a flavor of how we are seeing the big picture. But nothing changes in our strategy and nothing changes in terms of expectation to continue to expand gross margin in a prudent way.\nTom Palmer: Thank you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thanks.\nAndre Maciel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I just want to build upon the discussion you\u2019re having, which has been helpful. Really, you\u2019ve protected profitability pretty well in spite of inching up promotional activity in the U.S. Retail data that we see. And it sounds like from what you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re open to doing some tactical shifts in promotion spending from here if you see the returns. But I\u2019m wondering, do you see more significant spending level investments potentially in the horizon? It might not be promotion. It might be other marketing. And/or conversely, are you seeing any sort of tactics or content that could be improved upon that could really improve the base trends as you\u2019re talking about? What -- is there anything in the pipeline that you think might cause one of your key platforms to materially improve, just really good old-fashioned innovation and marketing improvements that you can make? Thanks very much.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me start. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just say, if you put into context, again, we have three growth pillars. Two of them, we have put the effort and now are both growing and gaining momentum. And if you think about the U.S. business, we have kind of diagnosed the problem exactly to about four to five brands. And just to give you context, we have over 200 brands in our company. So for us, it\u2019s very much focused on those areas and we went to attack. And hopefully you got to see in our prepared information that we sent out that already we are seeing how Capri Sun and Mac & Cheese, we are seeing the improvements and trends in sales as we have renovated, innovated and invested in both of those brands. We are seeing places like our Philadelphia business, Ore-Ida, Taco Bell, places where we have turned around those businesses and now driving significant amount of momentum as we go into the year and we have seen that even outside of the U.S. as well. So that idea of us continuing to understand how we play to our strengths by focusing on renovating, innovating and investing is something that has been proven model for us, and we already see evidence of that. And frankly, if you look at our Heinz business globally, today, it is a brand that globally for us is $4.5 billion and actually grew 4% in this particular quarter. So we know we have the right replicable model for us to apply and we will continue to do so, which is continue to make sure we have the right level of investing in marketing, not only the levels, but also continue to focus on the effectiveness of the marketing and then support it with the right investments in terms of technology, R&D, in order for us to fully, completely drive the innovation that we want to see. So in terms of promotions that I mentioned, it has a role. It is something that actually supports the business in certain locations in which can lead to that base growth. But frankly, our commitment to making sure that we invest in the things that will drive the brand\u2019s strengths over the long-term is the number one priority. Thank you for the question.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks. I guess, I would like to drill down on one of the product lines as well as Mac & Cheese. Carlos, you said that where you\u2019re making investments, it\u2019s really working, but it is showing up as one of the drivers of the declines in the quarter. And I wanted to know, like, there\u2019s a lot of elements of Mac & Cheese and your Kraft is a big innovator, but what elements are you kind of struggling in in Mac & Cheese, because the data shows market share losses and I see a lot of premium products being entered into the market by your competitors. Is that the part of it that is more difficult for Kraft to compete in?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, first of all, Rob, thanks for the question. In Mac & Cheese, remember, we have a brand that actually expands a number of formats. Like, if you see our Mac & Cheese Cups, already seeing a significant amount of improvements as we have gone into Q3. So that particular part of the business now is growing and gaining momentum as well. At the same time, we just launched new flavors to attract millennials. So a Ranch product, a Jalape\u00f1o product, and expect us to continue to work on those type of new flavors. We\u2019re also now bringing new shapes into the category, and I think, again, the idea of also bringing properties like Super Mario Brothers will be an opportunity for us to continue to drive that in terms of attractiveness into the category. So I think for us in making sure that we are continuing to focus on what are those consumers and what are the right formats and flavors that we can bring into the category. And at the same time, making sure that we talk to consumers, we do it in a culture-relevant way. What I\u2019ll tell you is that, one of the things that we\u2019re proud of is that a brand like ours, Mac & Cheese, is a brand that is built for the many, not the few. So we know the role that we have in today\u2019s families, in which we wanted to make sure that we provide affordable and approachable solutions that everybody can enjoy. So there\u2019s a role for us to continue to live in, at the same time that we\u2019re bringing new formats at different opening price points with different new flavors that attract a different type of consumers. So, again, we\u2019re seeing the progress already in Mac & Cheese Cups, and I can see us continue to build on this as we go into next year. I feel very good about the path we\u2019re taking.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thanks. Can I ask\u2026\nAndre Maciel: That\u2019s a good example, Rob, of items that require longer recovery, if you will, because innovation, you need to ramp up, consumers should try, they should repeat. So I feel great about the products that are there in the market, but they take time and you need to be patient. That\u2019s something that we have not been in the past, is patient with our innovation and we are changing that. But we feel good about what we\u2019re doing. And to your specific example, that\u2019s one of the core examples of just promoting more is not it. So thanks for the question.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.\nChris Carey: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. As I digest the conversation in the call this morning, I think, really what I\u2019m trying to understand is, this concept that I think Lunchables has been a headwind we have known about. Capri Sun was a headwind. And I think I\u2019m trying to understand what your perspective is on sort of the underlying ex those items and whether that specific bucket or a large bucket has changed relative to a few months ago and perhaps how you see that going forward. And if it has -- if things have changed, what do you think are the core drivers, right? So I appreciate the focus on some of these items. But when you take a step back on the rest of the business, what are the things that are happening that are pushing you to feel one way or the other? If you could just maybe expand on that, I think it would be helpful to kind of understand the trajectory of the underlying business ex those items? Thanks.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Sure. I think it sounds like you\u2019re referring mostly to the U.S. Retail business.\nChris Carey: Yeah. That\u2019s correct.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: If you think about Capri Sun, this is a product that over the summer we renovated the product. We are seeing now the momentum is starting to improve. We are seeing that the fact that we are bringing a new format into new channels, whether that is multi-serving club, new bottles, single bottles into retail, going into convenience, going into vending, that allows us to continue to build the momentum of the holistic part of the brand. So new formula. Consumers are trying it. We are seeing that actually it\u2019s helping us continue to start growing base volume. And at the same time, our focus continues to be how do we actually build that brand beyond just a typical retail channel in the 10-pack that for a long time has been the core part of the business. Now, in the case of Lunchables, I think the headwinds have really kind of offset some of the great work that is happening across Kraft Heinz. And I\u2019ll tell you that as we think about Q3, the back-to-school period proved to be more challenging than we had expected and why we actually recognize that it\u2019s going to take longer for us to do this, the recovery of Lunchables. Now, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that we are completely committed to it. We recognize that this idea of us making sure we continue to build the trust with parents and families, it is part of what our job has to be done. But as I mentioned earlier, we are -- if you go into first half of next year, we\u2019re bringing new products, renovating our quality, making sure that we have a new campaign that talks to both parents and kids, and at the same time, already in stores, we\u2019re launching nationwide new products for us to expand to a bigger audience. In this case, we relaunched kind of the spicy nachos as we know that is an opportunity for us with bringing new kids into our franchise. So it is a short-term situation that is making what was a difficult headwind more challenging because of the supply ingredient that we have in Q4. But over time, you\u2019ll see us continue to invest behind this to make sure that in fact Lunchables be the overall tremendous brand that we have created a shape into this category.\nChris Carey: But just outside of those brands, how do you feel about the business on an underlying? Sorry to ask another, but it\u2019s just with respect to the rest of the business excluding those two brands, have things materially changed or should we think about these really being the core headwinds on the relative trajectory from here? Thanks so much and sorry for interjecting again.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: No. Thank you. I appreciate the question. Again, if I go back to what is it that we intend to do? We intend to drive the growth of our company through three key areas. Making sure we continue to drive Global Away From Home superior than anyone else. We are doing that and we\u2019re getting momentum. We continue to drive emerging markets. We are seeing the growth that we saw in the quarter that gave us confidence that we can continue for us to drive that particular pillar. And in the U.S. Retail, really is about those few brands that we know we can act on. And in fact, a couple of those brands already, whether that is our Capri Sun business, whether it\u2019s our Mac & Cheese business, we already are seeing improvements as we go through the quarter that we believe are in the right path for us to continue to gain into the future. So, overall, I feel very good about the fact that we know where the situations that we have to address are. That we have the tools in-house by leveraging a brand growth system to actually build on the momentum of those businesses as we go into 2025. And also feel good that we can deliver the accelerated platforms and growth that we expect as a third pillar of our overall growth for the company. And the last thing I will say is, this is also underlined by us continuing to deliver great productivity that is helping us fuel the gross margin. So we\u2019re doing all this as we are delivering world-class level productivity. We\u2019re investing back in the business by investing in marketing, R&D and technology, and not compromising in the long-term growth of our company. And at the same time, also making sure that we are thoughtful about continuing to deliver great cash flow for our shareholders. Thank you so much for your question.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Anne-Marie Megela for any closing remarks.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Kraft Heinz.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Good morning. Sure. So, thanks for the question, Andrew. As you rightly pointed out, we do not expect at this moment to reach algo on any part of next year, and as we said in prepared remarks, we do expect Away From Home Globally and Emerging Markets to continue to improve and continue to grow, and we're going to see migrating closer and closer to the long-term algorithm. Emerging Markets continue to deliver volume growth that has been throughout the entire year and the pressure will be mostly concentrated on the U.S. Retail part of the business. We -- as Carlos said, I think, the industry dynamics this year did not go the way that we initially anticipated and we're exiting the year in a softer position, and we do expect, even though industry next year currently we expect should be in line with levels pre-pandemic, we do expect propensity to trade down, continue to be very elevated at similar, if not higher levels than what we have this year, which will continue to put pressure on share. The good thing about that is we remain very confident in what we're doing in our strategy for the long-term. We are being very disciplined in how we want to grow the business, for us it's critical to be focused on growing our base volume in a healthy way, better innovation, higher marketing, and being very prudent and surgical on where promotions make sense or not, and because the problem is very concentrated in four categories that represent the vast majority of the U.S. Retail challenge, some of them, as we have said in prior earnings, take a longer time to recover. You've got Capri Sun, for example, where they did a firm renovation, as we have said, it takes time until the trial gets generated and the repeat happens. So we need to be prudent. We are confident in what we are doing, but there is a longer trajectory out there. And with that, for execution, Carlos going to say a few words? Thank you. Just to add, regarding the charge, that is mostly a function of the decline that we are facing this year and the consequence of the allocated recoveries. So, when you do the cash flows, they land at a different spot because, remember, if you just look at Q3 alone, the sell-out of Lunchables is down about 15%. So, we -- as we expect the recovery to take longer and be gradual, that has an implication on that has resulted in the decline mostly. Yeah. Spoonable has been facing a soft sell-out now for several months. And as we said before, we believe it's not only, but mostly linked still to price gaps out there in the market. And we -- I don't think we have executed everything the way that we anticipated and that is work to do on that front. But we still see, versus historical levels, certain price gaps that are disadvantage. That's just where the issue should be. What I'll add is our long-term algorithm contemplates continuous gross margin expansion. We feel very confident and proud about what we have done on the supply chain efficiency side. We have now four consecutive years of very strong delivery coming from there and this year in particular is the highest ever for us. We feel confident about the pipeline to continue to sustain very good levels of productivity and this productivity is critical to allow us to reinvest in the business. As Carlos said, look, our priority is really on improved trends on the base volume. That volume that happens agnostic of promotions. That's 90% of food and beverage sales and people keep talking about promotions. The focus is base volume. And base volume, you do it to continue to innovate, bring the news to consumers, renovate the portfolio like we have been doing, do more and great marketing and that's what we want to do and that's what we continue to do. So our priority is there. So look, we're not going to talk in detail guidance of 2025. We're going to talk a lot about that in the next quarter. I think we've said enough about 2025 to give you just a flavor of how we are seeing the big picture. But nothing changes in our strategy and nothing changes in terms of expectation to continue to expand gross margin in a prudent way. Thank you. That's a good example, Rob, of items that require longer recovery, if you will, because innovation, you need to ramp up, consumers should try, they should repeat. So I feel great about the products that are there in the market, but they take time and you need to be patient. That's something that we have not been in the past, is patient with our innovation and we are changing that. But we feel good about what we're doing. And to your specific example, that's one of the core examples of just promoting more is not it. So thanks for the question."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As we report our third quarter results, I first want to recognize the entire Kraft Heinz team for their continued dedication to making life delicious for our consumers. In today's uncertain environment, people are increasingly seeking value. Our commitment to serving them with our iconic brand remains unwavering. For our stockholders, our focus remains on executing against our strategic pillars, driving profitable growth and generating strong cash flow. Both Global Away From Home and Emerging Markets are growing and gaining momentum, and we are addressing areas for improvements in U.S. Retail. By maintaining a disciplined management approach and long-term perspective, we are able to navigate today's near-term volatility while generating strong cash flow and reinvesting in the business. We have the right strategy, we have amazing talent and competitive advantage culture. This gives me great confidence that we can drive consistent, long-term, profitable growth. And with that, I have Andre joining me. So, let's open the call for the Q&A. Good morning. Thank you, Andrew. Let me start, and then maybe pass it off to Andre to give the details of how we see the impact of the long-term algorithm. I guess, first of all, I'll say, certainly, this year has been very different than I think many of us in the industry expected. So, I think, when we think about what we thought was going to be the exit versus what we see now, a number of circumstances have changed, but I think we are, frankly, better reacting to what the reality of the consumer, particularly in the U.S. and that has implications on long-term algorithms. So, I think, Andre, if you can just cover to that and then I can go back and talk about the execution aspect of your question. Yeah. Let me just start by saying, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do feel like we have the right strategy, and frankly, if you look at our two out of our three strategic pillars for growth, they are working and gaining momentum. That also gives me quite a bit of confidence in terms of our ability to execute, and in fact, the reality is that we have also delivered consistent, best-in-class productivity levels for five conservative quarters about 4% of COGS. Again, our ability to execute shows up that way. And if you think about Away From Home, you think about the way that the year began and how we were able to navigate that storm and be able to gain momentum as we go into the second half, again, our ability to execute in that area. If I think about Emerging Markets, the fact that we are growing volume, we are gaining share, we are increasing retribution, again, our ability to drive execution in that area as well, too. So we have a number of things that I think are going well that give us the confidence and now we are also diagnosing kind of their specific areas in U.S. Retail that, frankly, we know what we have to address and we are going to be putting our entire company focus on making sure we make the right turnaround on those businesses. Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. Thank you, Ken. I appreciate the question. First of all, let me just be clear. Lunchables is a very important part of our business, and defending a number one market share is a top priority. Full stop. Now, we are expected to see gradual improvements, but at the same time, we also recognize where we are right now. And part of that, I would say, is the negative publicity that we receive from that misleading interest group appears to be lingering longer. Remember, this is a brand that is focused on families and kids, so rebuilding that trust just takes some time. At the same time, we are seeing some competitive entry coming into the category, and in particular, and again, this is only for this particular quarter, we are seeing -- we are managing a particular supplier ingredient issue that we know that is a short-term focus on. So let me, I guess more importantly, let me tell you what the things that we are doing to recover. First of all, we are continuing to invest to expand the category penetration in this changing competitive environment. We are expanding flavors and formats. We just introduced a new spicy nachos that is launching nationwide as we speak. We are reimagining how we think about value at the shelf. We actually launched a new campaign for both parents and kids as we go into the first half of 2025, and at the same time, we are investing to renovate our entire line as we go into the first half of next year. Now, beyond this, we are also pulling forward a brand growth system to deploy against Lunchables to make sure that we have brand superiority for now and the future. And just to make sure that we have the right kind of nomenclature, brand growth system, if you recall, is a repeatable global model for growing our brands. It is essentially a process to solve consumer pain points with superior products delivering a convenient way at the best value possible. So we are using the best brand growth system that we have developed against the opportunity for us to drive this brand into next year. So, as Andre said, some of the things do take some time. We recognize the moment right now is being more challenged because of the one challenge in this particular quarter, but we believe this is a brand that will continue to grow and continue to be a hugely important part of our portfolio. Thank you again. Good morning, Peter. No. What I would say is, if essentially one of our suppliers was unable to fulfill one particular ingredient and it actually impacts essentially one SKU of Lunchables, but it's an important one, and again, we impact to be limited this year. So this is creating a short-term shortage of that particular ingredient and it's affecting us mostly in this particular quarter in Q4. But we continue to see opportunity for us to kind of resolve this in the very near future and get us back to what we need as we go into first half 2025. Okay. Listen, I think for us, we know that the right way for us to continue to build our brands is by driving superior products with better marketing and making sure that we have a full value format for all consumers, which is why we have continued to drive innovation in our products while we continue to focus on expanded distribution, both in club channel, Dollar General, as well as continue to expand our distribution in omnichannel. So that's number one. I think the question behind your question might be in terms of us thinking through whether we need anything else that we need to do in terms of managing price. I guess, what I would tell you is that, there are moments in which it does make sense for us to promote more. What -- the way we think through it is, let's make sure we do that in the right consumer location that ultimately leads to better base growth for the brand. So we need to do that intentionally so that we have the right investments returned on those promotions so that we avoid areas like barking, hunting behavior that ultimately do not have real incremental sales for the brands. So -- but at the same time, there are good places where, in fact, we have promoted more and we see that it makes sense for us to continue to see positive returns. So areas like Mac & Cheese Cups in which we're driving significant growth as we are right now, making sure we have the right price gaps and the right kind of attractive starting price points in the category. Areas like Cool Whip, what we know can also lead to better base growth for the future. So it is a combination of, again, making sure we grow the brand, leveraging a brand growth system, focusing innovation, renovation, better marketing, and at the same time, be thoughtful about the places in which it makes sense for us to manage those price gaps in a way that leads to the base growth going forward. Thanks. Let me start. Thank you for the question. First of all, I would just say, if you put into context, again, we have three growth pillars. Two of them, we have put the effort and now are both growing and gaining momentum. And if you think about the U.S. business, we have kind of diagnosed the problem exactly to about four to five brands. And just to give you context, we have over 200 brands in our company. So for us, it's very much focused on those areas and we went to attack. And hopefully you got to see in our prepared information that we sent out that already we are seeing how Capri Sun and Mac & Cheese, we are seeing the improvements and trends in sales as we have renovated, innovated and invested in both of those brands. We are seeing places like our Philadelphia business, Ore-Ida, Taco Bell, places where we have turned around those businesses and now driving significant amount of momentum as we go into the year and we have seen that even outside of the U.S. as well. So that idea of us continuing to understand how we play to our strengths by focusing on renovating, innovating and investing is something that has been proven model for us, and we already see evidence of that. And frankly, if you look at our Heinz business globally, today, it is a brand that globally for us is $4.5 billion and actually grew 4% in this particular quarter. So we know we have the right replicable model for us to apply and we will continue to do so, which is continue to make sure we have the right level of investing in marketing, not only the levels, but also continue to focus on the effectiveness of the marketing and then support it with the right investments in terms of technology, R&D, in order for us to fully, completely drive the innovation that we want to see. So in terms of promotions that I mentioned, it has a role. It is something that actually supports the business in certain locations in which can lead to that base growth. But frankly, our commitment to making sure that we invest in the things that will drive the brand's strengths over the long-term is the number one priority. Thank you for the question. Well, first of all, Rob, thanks for the question. In Mac & Cheese, remember, we have a brand that actually expands a number of formats. Like, if you see our Mac & Cheese Cups, already seeing a significant amount of improvements as we have gone into Q3. So that particular part of the business now is growing and gaining momentum as well. At the same time, we just launched new flavors to attract millennials. So a Ranch product, a Jalapen\u0303o product, and expect us to continue to work on those type of new flavors. We're also now bringing new shapes into the category, and I think, again, the idea of also bringing properties like Super Mario Brothers will be an opportunity for us to continue to drive that in terms of attractiveness into the category. So I think for us in making sure that we are continuing to focus on what are those consumers and what are the right formats and flavors that we can bring into the category. And at the same time, making sure that we talk to consumers, we do it in a culture-relevant way. What I'll tell you is that, one of the things that we're proud of is that a brand like ours, Mac & Cheese, is a brand that is built for the many, not the few. So we know the role that we have in today's families, in which we wanted to make sure that we provide affordable and approachable solutions that everybody can enjoy. So there's a role for us to continue to live in, at the same time that we're bringing new formats at different opening price points with different new flavors that attract a different type of consumers. So, again, we're seeing the progress already in Mac & Cheese Cups, and I can see us continue to build on this as we go into next year. I feel very good about the path we're taking. Sure. I think it sounds like you're referring mostly to the U.S. Retail business. If you think about Capri Sun, this is a product that over the summer we renovated the product. We are seeing now the momentum is starting to improve. We are seeing that the fact that we are bringing a new format into new channels, whether that is multi-serving club, new bottles, single bottles into retail, going into convenience, going into vending, that allows us to continue to build the momentum of the holistic part of the brand. So new formula. Consumers are trying it. We are seeing that actually it's helping us continue to start growing base volume. And at the same time, our focus continues to be how do we actually build that brand beyond just a typical retail channel in the 10-pack that for a long time has been the core part of the business. Now, in the case of Lunchables, I think the headwinds have really kind of offset some of the great work that is happening across Kraft Heinz. And I'll tell you that as we think about Q3, the back-to-school period proved to be more challenging than we had expected and why we actually recognize that it's going to take longer for us to do this, the recovery of Lunchables. Now, that doesn't change the fact that we are completely committed to it. We recognize that this idea of us making sure we continue to build the trust with parents and families, it is part of what our job has to be done. But as I mentioned earlier, we are -- if you go into first half of next year, we're bringing new products, renovating our quality, making sure that we have a new campaign that talks to both parents and kids, and at the same time, already in stores, we're launching nationwide new products for us to expand to a bigger audience. In this case, we relaunched kind of the spicy nachos as we know that is an opportunity for us with bringing new kids into our franchise. So it is a short-term situation that is making what was a difficult headwind more challenging because of the supply ingredient that we have in Q4. But over time, you'll see us continue to invest behind this to make sure that in fact Lunchables be the overall tremendous brand that we have created a shape into this category. No. Thank you. I appreciate the question. Again, if I go back to what is it that we intend to do? We intend to drive the growth of our company through three key areas. Making sure we continue to drive Global Away From Home superior than anyone else. We are doing that and we're getting momentum. We continue to drive emerging markets. We are seeing the growth that we saw in the quarter that gave us confidence that we can continue for us to drive that particular pillar. And in the U.S. Retail, really is about those few brands that we know we can act on. And in fact, a couple of those brands already, whether that is our Capri Sun business, whether it's our Mac & Cheese business, we already are seeing improvements as we go through the quarter that we believe are in the right path for us to continue to gain into the future. So, overall, I feel very good about the fact that we know where the situations that we have to address are. That we have the tools in-house by leveraging a brand growth system to actually build on the momentum of those businesses as we go into 2025. And also feel good that we can deliver the accelerated platforms and growth that we expect as a third pillar of our overall growth for the company. And the last thing I will say is, this is also underlined by us continuing to deliver great productivity that is helping us fuel the gross margin. So we're doing all this as we are delivering world-class level productivity. We're investing back in the business by investing in marketing, R&D and technology, and not compromising in the long-term growth of our company. And at the same time, also making sure that we are thoughtful about continuing to deliver great cash flow for our shareholders. Thank you so much for your question."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. This is Anne-Marie Megela, Head of Global Investor Relations at The Kraft Heinz Company, and welcome to our Q&A session for our second quarter 2024 business update. During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we think today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures which excludes certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News and Events, or discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. I will now hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera for opening comments. Carlos, over to you.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Recognizing that it remains a difficult consumer environment, I am proud that we at Kraft Heinz are providing high-quality, convenient solutions that are a great value, brand worth paying for. And we will continue to stay focused on renovating and innovating with new benefits functionality and accessibility. At the same time, our teams have been relentless in unlocking efficiencies with a mindset of continuous improvements. And as a result of greater productivity and efficiencies, we have been able to hold prices below inflation this year while continuing to invest in innovation, marketing and R&D. And for our stockholders, through our dividends and share repurchases, we have returned over $1.5 billion in capital so far this year. I am very encouraged on how our focus on improving working capital is paying off. We increased free cash flow nearly $100 million or approximately 9% compared to last year and maintain our targeted leverage ratio. And finally, it's hard to believe that it has only been 4 months since my leadership team came together. We're on this journey together, all committed to driving improvements and achieving our company dream. I see the ownership and grit with my direct reports and across the organization. We are all embracing this new operating model and ways of working, and we are only getting stronger and stronger. With that, I have Andre joining me. So let's open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.\nAndrew Lazar: Carlos, you mentioned the need for selective promotion and trade spend activity in the second half just to drive better volume results for a more value-seeking consumer. I'm curious if there's a way to dimensionalize the portion of the percentage of sales that are sort of in need some adjustments. And if there are any particular hotspots that require maybe more aggressive pricing actions or sort of a reset of sorts? Basically, I'm just trying to get a sense for how broad the price point issue really is across the portfolio with the understanding that, as you've talked about promotional right now are still below those you saw in 2019.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Andre, why don't you start and I'll add complement.\nAndre Maciel: Andrew, thanks for the question. Look, we -- as we said in our guidance, we're contemplating a step-up in trade investment level. You saw that in Q2, we already had a little more trade than what we had in the last year, where those are still well below 2019 levels. We believe that looking forward, we are more focused on those price gaps versus branded competitors and in places where it makes sense for the long term. We -- I think we have been saying all along, and we continue to stick to this that we believe that's the way we want to grow the business is not through over relying on promotions and rather continue to invest behind our innovation, our renovation and our market investments. And that's what we have been doing, and we're sticking to that. We are confident about that into the future. But in the short-term, we are seeing selected spots where it does make sense to add promotions to close those gaps. I'm not going to give you like an overly precise number to your question, but I estimate in the 30% to 40% of the portfolio where those price gaps require some incremental level of investments in the U.S.\nAndrew Lazar: It's really, really helpful. I mean. Yes, and then just a really quick one. Do you anticipate volume inflecting to positive in the back half? Because I think by our math, it's still implied that, that's the case even by the new guidance range? And I guess, how do you see volume progress playing out specifically in North America in the second half?\nAndre Maciel: We do expect revenue and volume to gradually improve throughout the quarters. In our midpoint of the new guidance we don't have -- we don't need volume to grow for us to achieve our guidance. So our price expected to be in the -- around 1% territory for the total portfolio. So if you think about the second half, what's impacted the guidance is sales declining 0.5% and so that you can see. Now it's good. The good thing is volumes in emerging markets, despite some headwinds in Brazil and China, continue to be positive. They are positive in the second quarter. They will continue to be so a year to go. And in the U.S., we're going to -- we expect to have volume continue to improve. Again, in our midpoint, we don't need the volumes to turn positive for us to achieve it.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: And what I would say to add is -- also give me confidence as we think about that trajectory improving in the second half is that we are very much focused on driving that value in very much in a sustainable way. So it cannot just be value for the sake of value with delivering value in a sustainable way through innovation, renovation and marketing, for frankly, families that we know are spending more time cooking at home. So when you see some of our innovation around things like Mac & Cheese, where we're bringing new shapes, new flavors, new pack size to consumers at different price points. When you see us bringing New Mexican solutions with Taco Bell and Delimex, that allows us to, again, bring families solutions for their home when they're spending more time together. That is part of us kind of bringing new ideas and ways in which we can bring value to families at this particular time. And we're seeing that also in Away From Home business, where we continue to see the improvements on the momentum of the business. We are seeing the improvements that we are now servicing better going into Q3. We are also getting new customers in Away From Home business that, again, help us make sure that we're building on the success we've had in the past. And as Andre said, we have been selective in our investments in trade, but we're also committed to a disciplined approach to the RGM tools that we have used in the past, and we know that help us make sure that we continue to make a balance on the profitability of how we spend in a smart way.\nAndre Maciel: Just a final comment is I think our dated guidance also reflects this philosophy in this approach because you see we have adjusted our net sales guidance down, but we largely kept our EBIT growth and we kept fully capital EPS growth. So that's what we are sticking for. We have been very disciplined in being very thoughtful about the type of investments we make and what are the long-term implications of that, and we're going to continue to do so.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.\nKen Goldman: Just sticking on the subject of the back half. You provided a number of reasons for optimism. I think you've cited more innovation, renovation and marketing. You've talked about expanded distribution in certain parts of the business and then, of course, those targeted promotions. Just as we think about these drivers, plus the absence of the plant maintenance headwind, which are you counting on as being the most important and meaningful to hitting your updated outlook? Do the promos have to work? Is it really about innovation striking a note with consumer? I just want to get a better idea of kind of your visibility and reliance on the factors you're talking about.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you for your question, Ken. I think, frankly, is a -- it depends a little bit on the region of the world. I think if you think about our emerging markets, as Andre pointed out, we have been growing volume. We continue to see improvements as we go into the second half of the year and we're ready. We exited June in a much better way than we had for the whole quarter. So we are seeing that in that case, distribution gains that we have invested in our go-to-market strategy in emerging marketing is working. And we continue to build the success we've had in the past. In our Away From Home business, it really is us continue to drive the improvements on our service, given our plant closure that we had in Q2, and those continue to start winning and winning some customers that we, in fact, already have qualify for us in the second half of the year, and that is both globally in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So we are not expecting initially a big improvement in the overall situation and away from home in the U.S. But what we do expect is that we are, in fact, continuing to see the progress in our distribution gains as we go forward. And in the U.S. and North America for all, is really driven by this balance between us driving this innovation, renovation of our brands, truly be more thoughtful about the value that we're creating with consumers in terms of the better products, the better ideas that we're bringing to market as well as being thoughtful on how we are going to spend on our revenue management tools -- spread our revenue management tools in order for us to make sure that we're having the right price gaps in the intended fashion across the branded competitors. So that would give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about the overall portfolio. I don't know, Andre, anything you want to add?\nAndre Maciel: No, I think [indiscernible]\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: You called out a couple of overseas markets, specifically the U.K., China and Brazil, different dynamics in each of those markets. But obviously, a lot of work going on as you try to correct trade gaps -- or sorry, price gaps in the U.K. and fight through consumer demand softness in China and Brazil. I guess could you just expand on what you're seeing in those markets? And maybe a bit more color on what your expectations are for the back half in terms of any kind of sequential improvement?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So particularly maybe starting with the U.K. We -- as we said last year in earnings, this is a place that suffer a significant amount of inflation, probably even more than other developed markets. And private label in that particular market has started to get a lot of traction. And we decided in Q3 last year, to start to step up investments, to protect the volume. We do have some factories in the U.K. that also need to be mindful about the utilization of those factories, and protect the volume for some of the strong brands we have over there. We have put that in place since now almost a year ago, and we have seen the returns happening on the volume share side. So I think we're moving in the right direction. And with -- we were able to mostly protect even gross margin because of the amount of efficiency that we have generated there. So U.K., I think, is moving in the right direction. When it comes to China, a similar to what we have heard from others, the industry continues to be soft. I mean vessel the expectations that we do have about a country like China. So we continue to gain market share in modern trade. So that's a good thing. But the industry is just not working. And I think we set our expectation moving forward that it is for the short-term about China industry growth. In Brazil, we -- the good thing is we continue to gain market share. So that's been very consistent. And I feel good about that. Consumer has been demonstrating similar to other parts of the world fatigue and has been showing also vulnerability. So we saw some price gaps to branded players or private label that is negligible, also coming down. So we had to invest. But we face a situation where the customers adjusted their inventories down. You have to understand that in the emerging markets, the retailers tend to carry more inventory than in developed markets. So in a country like Brazil, you see inventories at the 45, 50 days level compared to the U.S., where you see 20 days, 25 days. So is very different. And what we have seen a situation like we are right now high interest-based consumer tightness, is [indiscernible] the inventories down. And honestly, we are not expecting that, and that created a challenge for us in Brazil in the first half of the year. We believe that inventories -- we believe now that they should be at the appropriate level, which should allow us to improve the situation. But yes, that's a little bit of a snapshot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities.\nJohn Baumgartner: I wanted to come back to North America. Your portfolio in a lot of your categories, you're not the highest priced product. And you think there should be some benefit from trade down into your brands. But with the focus on managing price gaps to other brands, it also seems like the equation is still very much price based. So at this point, how do you feel about the ability to redefine your portfolio through innovation, marketing, where you can better compete on non-price factors? Because it feels like there's already been a lot of work done with ingredient reformulations and so on. How do you think about the non-price competition?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Well, first of all, thank you for the question. And as you pointed out, we have a series of iconic brands across our portfolio in North America that we feel great about. And you've seen already. I mean, you've seen brands from Philadelphia to -- or either where you are seeing the growth as we have continued to renovate those businesses are the success that we've had in a brand like Jell-O, where we have continued to renovate. So we have a playbook on how we continue to renovate our business, our brands to make sure that they, in fact, continue to be resonating with consumers today and for the future. I think in places where we are seeing that consumers are making choices as they are trying to manage the cash flow of the family, we also have to be aware that we have to provide consumers options at different price points so they can be part of their role basket size of the cash flow that they have available to them. That's why in a business like Mac & Cheese, well, it's certainly something that can fit the entire -- can feed the entire family. We want to make sure we have different price points in which we can come in to consumers and allow them to make sure they continue to enjoy our products. And it's also about us being able to be accessible in new places. One of the things we find right now is that consumers are actually increasing the number of trips and locations in which they shop. So for us, it's important that we continue to expand where consumers are going to try in our brands and why we have been so much focused on driving our improvements in terms of distribution in the dollar channel, whether that is with our Oscar Mayer businesses and making sure that we have the product they're looking for at that particular venue. But it's also us expanding our distribution in places like club, where we know consumers are also looking for different ways in which we can find value for the family. So for us, it's applying the playbook that we have from renovating and innovating and at the same time, making sure we have providing the access to families as they're shopping from -- in new spaces whether they're going from a dollar store to grocery to club and our brands continue to be there. Those are all things that you'll see us continue to add as we go forward into the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler.\nMichael Lavery: Just was wondering in away from home, maybe two things. You called out that it had the 2.1% decline globally. Obviously, you had the plant closure and some discontinuations. Can you unpack maybe the components there and give a sense of how much the slower foot traffic was a headwind? Or what the -- what the growth rate was excluding those kind of onetime things and maybe how much was from slower foot traffic? And then also, you've given an update in the past on the remix launch in BurgerFi the test. And just curious how that's progressing there.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Andre, you want to start then I'll go?\nAndre Maciel: Sure. So our Global Away From Home business declined 2.1% in the quarter. And the impact from the plant closure is about 200 bps. So meaning that we will be flat without that effect. That will put us in a situation of similar performance to Q1, if you remove the plant closure effect. The planned exits that we had at the end of last year, they had back in the quarter of roughly 150 bps. So will be then growing 1.5%. So we're still gapped versus our long-term ago. We have been gaining sustaining share. Again, if you remove the effects from the plant closure, what we saw in Q2 in the industry is in the category that in where we play is that industry was worse in Q2 than in Q1, which I think we were not really expecting that. So in the U.S., about 100 bps softer in Q2 versus Q1. So I think the performance on our side helped to offset that headwind that happened in Q2.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. And then to your question about our equipment strategy is pretty comprehensive in terms of how we think about bringing innovation, but also solving pain points for the operators and Away From Home. So the HEINZ REMIX, today, we have that already in market. And the way I think about it is, it is really a moment for us to do the trial, making sure we get the learning from that so that we can scale that in a meaningful way in 2025. And so far, we're hearing great fear from operators. We're collecting a number of data from consumers, and we're seeing how that actually allows us to even improve as we think about how we are going to deploy this further in 2025. The interesting thing, too, is that initially, we thought this would be something that people would be using most in their burgers. We actually are seeing them using in other foods as well when they see that in the different QSRs. Now beyond the HEINZ REMIX, we also have been focusing on bringing new dispensers, tabs and bending into the pipeline. And again, it's part of us thinking about more comprehensive, about how do we solve the pain point for operators. So our dispensers, for example, that are much easier for operators to clean, and it allows us to actually make sure that they reduce the amount of labor involved in the collecting and changing of the dispensers, they began shipping to customers now in Q2 and we believe that actually it's going to continue to improve distribution as we go into the second half of the year. And already beginning to get much, much distribution that we had originally expected. So you'll see you'll continue to now drive some of the learning that we began in the U.S. globally as well as we continue to then bring more of those tabs and bending ideas into the marketplace. And thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore.\nDavid Palmer: Just looking ahead in the U.S. retail and you're looking to stabilize things there, and thanks for the commentary earlier on volume and pricing. But -- how are you thinking about improvement across the portfolio and what we're going to be seeing in the scanner data? You've called out Capri Sun and Lunchables as two areas that might improve, that are turnaround situations, those are down, certainly the most, but that doesn't necessarily mean those are the biggest areas of improvement that you're anticipating. How are you thinking about which brands and which categories will improve the most in the second half?\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me start. And then what I would say is -- we called those out because there were a meaningful headwind for us and in our second quarter. And I think it's something that the teams have done an amazing job of making sure that we have the right plans as we go forward. I mean, it was meaningful to the point that in the case of Lunchables, we saw from a low point of, I would say, down 17%, the worst weeks in the second quarter. What we have actually seen a steady recovery since that particular point, and we're building that improvement. And the teams are getting ready, both in terms of renovating, innovating, doubling the marketing spend, improving the media mix, improving the targeting strategies and increasing the value equation for the consumers as we go forward. And that includes innovation. Some of it we included already in some of the slides that you saw, but also we have other innovations that for competitive reasons, we're not including yet, but they will be coming in the second half of the year as well. For us, we continue to expand in the Lunchables within partnership with Del Monte in the second half of the year. So there is a meaningful amount of program that is supporting our Lunchables and you see that from -- and you begin to see that really come into fruition in our back-to-school program when we're teaming up with the Transformer movie, as something that, frankly, we have been successful in the past of doing movie tie-ins, as we have done with the Heinz brand. And we did point out as well Capri Sun because, again, it was a meaningful headwind for us in the second quarter that again, the teams have been very much focused on driving a change in trajectory as we go into the second half of the year. They have renovated the original Capri Sun to better align with the consumer taste preference, invested twice the marketing as we go into 2023 versus 2023. We have secured strong back-to-school displays with customers. We have invested in the right promotional events, and we have expanded into new channels with club. So again, it had both places where we have seen some meaningful headwind in Q2 that we now have also just as a meaningful reaction in terms of improving the trajectory as we go forward. And that will continue with the other things that are working for us. We do have some positive momentum in parts of our accelerated platform. I mentioned Narita, which is gaining almost a share point our Mexican business, we're also gaining 80 bps. Cream cheese business has sustained growth through the entire first half of the year. So those are business that we'll continue to see gain that momentum as we go into the second half of the year.\nAndre Maciel: In think we should expect Mac & Cheese as well. There's a lot going on in the Mac & Cheese in the second half. That might be worth.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes, yes. I think that -- if I think about how do I round up the items and accelerated platforms. There's probably two areas in which we feel like we also have to be focused on, and we are. One is on our Spoonable business in which we are, in fact, making sure that we are having the right brand price gaps against our branded competitors. So we are investing in new flavors and making sure we have renovating the package design on a Spoonable business. And in Mac & Cheese, as you saw from our slides, you saw us making sure that we bring in, again, new innovation, new shapes, new flavors, tie in now with Super Mario Brothers. So that idea of us being able to bring innovation and exciting into the Mac & Cheese business is part of us continue to see us improving the momentum of that business we go into the second half of the year which we know is a product that the families really care about in moments in which they're looking for value to feed their entire family.\nDavid Palmer: Great. And I was going to follow up and ask you about condiments and sauces, and in particular, the spoonables area like you discussed it, but you covered it. I'll pass it on.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen.\nRobert Moskow: Andre and Carlos, I think one of the concerns on Kraft Heinz stock is that all this great progress you've made on gross margin recovery might come under pressure over the next 12 months because you have to make some of these price investments and because volume has been weak. So maybe to address those, can you talk to -- what would gross margin have been in 2Q excluding some of these onetime issues like the plant closure and the other elements that maybe are more transitory? Could this have been an even higher number? And would that kind of give us confidence, therefore, that there's more room for gross margin expansion into 2025?\nAndre Maciel: Rob, thanks for the question. Look, in both Q1 and Q2, we did have a few situations that negatively impacted gross margin like very onetime in nature. I'd be reluctant to give you a precise percentage points, but we did have quite a few substantial events in Q1 and Q2. And despite that, we are able to expand the way that we did it. As you head into the second half, last year, we had a big step-up in gross margin in the second half. So we're going to see a more muted year-over-year impact from gross margin. But -- so -- but that's part of the plan since the beginning. So we're not really worried about that. As we head in '25, and I'm not going to give guidance although, but if you remember our long-term algorithm, we do contemplate continuous gross margin expansion, not at the levels that we are seeing right now, but in the 25, 75 bps-ish. But as a consequence of the very strong efficiency that we have, I think we were able to fix the supply chain now a few years ago, and we have now for 4 consecutive years in very strong delivery coming from the team. We have -- we feel very good about the pipeline that we have. We have been able to see to not only -- remember, we had a 3% inflation this year. We're only pricing 1%, and we were able to offset that with efficiencies and still expand gross margin should we invest in the business. So we do expect that this equation might continue to work into the future. So we should expect a more gradual but continuous gross margin expansion.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: The only thing I would build, Rob, is this idea was really changing the rewiring of the company, where we are all focused on driving efficiency because it's the fuel for us to drive profitable growth has now been embedded across the company. You see that with procurement, you see in operation, but you also see in marketing on us being able to have more efficiencies of how we go to market improving the return on investment. You see that in trade on how we apply AI to have better tools on how we actually have better investments and profitable ways in which we can embed our trade as we go into the marketplace. So it is not a one and done. It is something that we believe can be a sustainable strength for us as a company. And personally, I believe that having healthy gross margin is truly the key component of having a virtuous cycle of growth, and that is a big part of why we are so strong believers on a long-term algorithm for the company.\nAndre Maciel: The changes in operating model that we have done a couple of years ago to really reintegrate commercial and supply chain, I think it's really paying off big time. And the incentive alignments that we have done, we mentioned this before, like everyone in the company has 2 KPIs in common, which market share and gross margin because we want people to grow profitably. So I think that also contributes to that.\nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your interest in Kraft Heinz.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Andrew, thanks for the question. Look, we -- as we said in our guidance, we're contemplating a step-up in trade investment level. You saw that in Q2, we already had a little more trade than what we had in the last year, where those are still well below 2019 levels. We believe that looking forward, we are more focused on those price gaps versus branded competitors and in places where it makes sense for the long term. We -- I think we have been saying all along, and we continue to stick to this that we believe that's the way we want to grow the business is not through over relying on promotions and rather continue to invest behind our innovation, our renovation and our market investments. And that's what we have been doing, and we're sticking to that. We are confident about that into the future. But in the short-term, we are seeing selected spots where it does make sense to add promotions to close those gaps. I'm not going to give you like an overly precise number to your question, but I estimate in the 30% to 40% of the portfolio where those price gaps require some incremental level of investments in the U.S. We do expect revenue and volume to gradually improve throughout the quarters. In our midpoint of the new guidance we don't have -- we don't need volume to grow for us to achieve our guidance. So our price expected to be in the -- around 1% territory for the total portfolio. So if you think about the second half, what's impacted the guidance is sales declining 0.5% and so that you can see. Now it's good. The good thing is volumes in emerging markets, despite some headwinds in Brazil and China, continue to be positive. They are positive in the second quarter. They will continue to be so a year to go. And in the U.S., we're going to -- we expect to have volume continue to improve. Again, in our midpoint, we don't need the volumes to turn positive for us to achieve it. Just a final comment is I think our dated guidance also reflects this philosophy in this approach because you see we have adjusted our net sales guidance down, but we largely kept our EBIT growth and we kept fully capital EPS growth. So that's what we are sticking for. We have been very disciplined in being very thoughtful about the type of investments we make and what are the long-term implications of that, and we're going to continue to do so. No, I think [indiscernible] Sure. So particularly maybe starting with the U.K. We -- as we said last year in earnings, this is a place that suffer a significant amount of inflation, probably even more than other developed markets. And private label in that particular market has started to get a lot of traction. And we decided in Q3 last year, to start to step up investments, to protect the volume. We do have some factories in the U.K. that also need to be mindful about the utilization of those factories, and protect the volume for some of the strong brands we have over there. We have put that in place since now almost a year ago, and we have seen the returns happening on the volume share side. So I think we're moving in the right direction. And with -- we were able to mostly protect even gross margin because of the amount of efficiency that we have generated there. So U.K., I think, is moving in the right direction. When it comes to China, a similar to what we have heard from others, the industry continues to be soft. I mean vessel the expectations that we do have about a country like China. So we continue to gain market share in modern trade. So that's a good thing. But the industry is just not working. And I think we set our expectation moving forward that it is for the short-term about China industry growth. In Brazil, we -- the good thing is we continue to gain market share. So that's been very consistent. And I feel good about that. Consumer has been demonstrating similar to other parts of the world fatigue and has been showing also vulnerability. So we saw some price gaps to branded players or private label that is negligible, also coming down. So we had to invest. But we face a situation where the customers adjusted their inventories down. You have to understand that in the emerging markets, the retailers tend to carry more inventory than in developed markets.

We believe that inventories -- we believe now that they should be at the appropriate level, which should allow us to improve the situation. But yes, that's a little bit of a snapshot. Sure.

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Recognizing that it remains a difficult consumer environment, I am proud that we at Kraft Heinz are providing high-quality, convenient solutions that are a great value, brand worth paying for. And we will continue to stay focused on renovating and innovating with new benefits functionality and accessibility. At the same time, our teams have been relentless in unlocking efficiencies with a mindset of continuous improvements. And as a result of greater productivity and efficiencies, we have been able to hold prices below inflation this year while continuing to invest in innovation, marketing and R&D. And for our stockholders, through our dividends and share repurchases, we have returned over $1.5 billion in capital so far this year. I am very encouraged on how our focus on improving working capital is paying off. We increased free cash flow nearly $100 million or approximately 9% compared to last year and maintain our targeted leverage ratio. And finally, it's hard to believe that it has only been 4 months since my leadership team came together. We're on this journey together, all committed to driving improvements and achieving our company dream. I see the ownership and grit with my direct reports and across the organization. We are all embracing this new operating model and ways of working, and we are only getting stronger and stronger. With that, I have Andre joining me. So let's open the call for Q&A. Andre, why don't you start and I'll add complement. And what I would say to add is -- also give me confidence as we think about that trajectory improving in the second half is that we are very much focused on driving that value in very much in a sustainable way. So it cannot just be value for the sake of value with delivering value in a sustainable way through innovation, renovation and marketing, for frankly, families that we know are spending more time cooking at home. So when you see some of our innovation around things like Mac & Cheese, where we're bringing new shapes, new flavors, new pack size to consumers at different price points. When you see us bringing New Mexican solutions with Taco Bell and Delimex, that allows us to, again, bring families solutions for their home when they're spending more time together. That is part of us kind of bringing new ideas and ways in which we can bring value to families at this particular time. And we're seeing that also in Away From Home business, where we continue to see the improvements on the momentum of the business. We are seeing the improvements that we are now servicing better going into Q3. We are also getting new customers in Away From Home business that, again, help us make sure that we're building on the success we've had in the past. And as Andre said, we have been selective in our investments in trade, but we're also committed to a disciplined approach to the RGM tools that we have used in the past, and we know that help us make sure that we continue to make a balance on the profitability of how we spend in a smart way. Thank you for your question, Ken. I think, frankly, is a -- it depends a little bit on the region of the world. I think if you think about our emerging markets, as Andre pointed out, we have been growing volume. We continue to see improvements as we go into the second half of the year and we're ready. We exited June in a much better way than we had for the whole quarter. So we are seeing that in that case, distribution gains that we have invested in our go-to-market strategy in emerging marketing is working. And we continue to build the success we've had in the past. In our Away From Home business, it really is us continue to drive the improvements on our service, given our plant closure that we had in Q2, and those continue to start winning and winning some customers that we, in fact, already have qualify for us in the second half of the year, and that is both globally in the U.S. and outside the U.S. So we are not expecting initially a big improvement in the overall situation and away from home in the U.S. But what we do expect is that we are, in fact, continuing to see the progress in our distribution gains as we go forward. And in the U.S. and North America for all, is really driven by this balance between us driving this innovation, renovation of our brands, truly be more thoughtful about the value that we're creating with consumers in terms of the better products, the better ideas that we're bringing to market as well as being thoughtful on how we are going to spend on our revenue management tools -- spread our revenue management tools in order for us to make sure that we're having the right price gaps in the intended fashion across the branded competitors. So that would give you a little bit of sense of how we're thinking about the overall portfolio. I don't know, Andre, anything you want to add? Yes. Well, first of all, thank you for the question. And as you pointed out, we have a series of iconic brands across our portfolio in North America that we feel great about. And you've seen already. I mean, you've seen brands from Philadelphia to -- or either where you are seeing the growth as we have continued to renovate those businesses are the success that we've had in a brand like Jell-O, where we have continued to renovate. So we have a playbook on how we continue to renovate our business, our brands to make sure that they, in fact, continue to be resonating with consumers today and for the future. I think in places where we are seeing that consumers are making choices as they are trying to manage the cash flow of the family, we also have to be aware that we have to provide consumers options at different price points so they can be part of their role basket size of the cash flow that they have available to them. That's why in a business like Mac & Cheese, well, it's certainly something that can fit the entire -- can feed the entire family. We want to make sure we have different price points in which we can come in to consumers and allow them to make sure they continue to enjoy our products. And it's also about us being able to be accessible in new places. One of the things we find right now is that consumers are actually increasing the number of trips and locations in which they shop. So for us, it's important that we continue to expand where consumers are going to try in our brands and why we have been so much focused on driving our improvements in terms of distribution in the dollar channel, whether that is with our Oscar Mayer businesses and making sure that we have the product they're looking for at that particular venue. But it's also us expanding our distribution in places like club, where we know consumers are also looking for different ways in which we can find value for the family. So for us, it's applying the playbook that we have from renovating and innovating and at the same time, making sure we have providing the access to families as they're shopping from -- in new spaces whether they're going from a dollar store to grocery to club and our brands continue to be there. Those are all things that you'll see us continue to add as we go forward into the second half of the year. Andre, you want to start then I'll go? Yes. And then to your question about our equipment strategy is pretty comprehensive in terms of how we think about bringing innovation, but also solving pain points for the operators and Away From Home. So the HEINZ REMIX, today, we have that already in market. And the way I think about it is, it is really a moment for us to do the trial, making sure we get the learning from that so that we can scale that in a meaningful way in 2025. And so far, we're hearing great fear from operators. We're collecting a number of data from consumers, and we're seeing how that actually allows us to even improve as we think about how we are going to deploy this further in 2025. The interesting thing, too, is that initially, we thought this would be something that people would be using most in their burgers. We actually are seeing them using in other foods as well when they see that in the different QSRs. Now beyond the HEINZ REMIX, we also have been focusing on bringing new dispensers, tabs and bending into the pipeline. And again, it's part of us thinking about more comprehensive, about how do we solve the pain point for operators. So our dispensers, for example, that are much easier for operators to clean, and it allows us to actually make sure that they reduce the amount of labor involved in the collecting and changing of the dispensers, they began shipping to customers now in Q2 and we believe that actually it's going to continue to improve distribution as we go into the second half of the year. And already beginning to get much, much distribution that we had originally expected. So you'll see you'll continue to now drive some of the learning that we began in the U.S. globally as well as we continue to then bring more of those tabs and bending ideas into the marketplace. And thanks for the question. Let me start. And then what I would say is -- we called those out because there were a meaningful headwind for us and in our second quarter. And I think it's something that the teams have done an amazing job of making sure that we have the right plans as we go forward. I mean, it was meaningful to the point that in the case of Lunchables, we saw from a low point of, I would say, down 17%, the worst weeks in the second quarter. What we have actually seen a steady recovery since that particular point, and we're building that improvement. And the teams are getting ready, both in terms of renovating, innovating, doubling the marketing spend, improving the media mix, improving the targeting strategies and increasing the value equation for the consumers as we go forward. And that includes innovation. Some of it we included already in some of the slides that you saw, but also we have other innovations that for competitive reasons, we're not including yet, but they will be coming in the second half of the year as well. For us, we continue to expand in the Lunchables within partnership with Del Monte in the second half of the year. So there is a meaningful amount of program that is supporting our Lunchables and you see that from -- and you begin to see that really come into fruition in our back-to-school program when we're teaming up with the Transformer movie, as something that, frankly, we have been successful in the past of doing movie tie-ins, as we have done with the Heinz brand. And we did point out as well Capri Sun because, again, it was a meaningful headwind for us in the second quarter that again, the teams have been very much focused on driving a change in trajectory as we go into the second half of the year. They have renovated the original Capri Sun to better align with the consumer taste preference, invested twice the marketing as we go into 2023 versus 2023. We have secured strong back-to-school displays with customers. We have invested in the right promotional events, and we have expanded into new channels with club. So again, it had both places where we have seen some meaningful headwind in Q2 that we now have also just as a meaningful reaction in terms of improving the trajectory as we go forward. And that will continue with the other things that are working for us. We do have some positive momentum in parts of our accelerated platform. I mentioned Narita, which is gaining almost a share point our Mexican business, we're also gaining 80 bps. Cream cheese business has sustained growth through the entire first half of the year. So those are business that we'll continue to see gain that momentum as we go into the second half of the year. Yes, yes. I think that -- if I think about how do I round up the items and accelerated platforms. There's probably two areas in which we feel like we also have to be focused on, and we are. One is on our Spoonable business in which we are, in fact, making sure that we are having the right brand price gaps against our branded competitors. So we are investing in new flavors and making sure we have renovating the package design on a Spoonable business. And in Mac & Cheese, as you saw from our slides, you saw us making sure that we bring in, again, new innovation, new shapes, new flavors, tie in now with Super Mario Brothers. So that idea of us being able to bring innovation and exciting into the Mac & Cheese business is part of us continue to see us improving the momentum of that business we go into the second half of the year which we know is a product that the families really care about in moments in which they're looking for value to feed their entire family. The only thing I would build, Rob, is this idea was really changing the rewiring of the company, where we are all focused on driving efficiency because it's the fuel for us to drive profitable growth has now been embedded across the company. You see that with procurement, you see in operation, but you also see in marketing on us being able to have more efficiencies of how we go to market improving the return on investment. You see that in trade on how we apply AI to have better tools on how we actually have better investments and profitable ways in which we can embed our trade as we go into the marketplace. So it is not a one and done. It is something that we believe can be a sustainable strength for us as a company. And personally, I believe that having healthy gross margin is truly the key component of having a virtuous cycle of growth, and that is a big part of why we are so strong believers on a long-term algorithm for the company."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anne-Marie Megela, Global Head of Kraft Heinz Investor Relations. \nAnne-Marie Megela: Thank you, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our Q&A session for our first quarter 2024 business update. \n During today's call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for the future, including items related to our business plans and expectations, strategy, efforts and investments and related timing and expected impacts. These statements are based on how we see things today, and actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please see the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in today's earnings release, which accompanies this call as well as our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more information regarding these risks and uncertainties. \n Additionally, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain items from our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to today's earnings release and the non-GAAP information available on our website at ir.kraftheinzcompany.com under News & Events for a discussion of our non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP financial measures. \n Before we begin the Q&A session, it gives me great pleasure to hand it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Carlos Abrams-Rivera, for opening comments. Please, Carlos. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So before we begin our Q&A, I'd just like to provide some perspective on our top-up session here at Kraft Heinz, our consumers. And while we've seen a notable uptick in consumer sentiment in the first quarter, there is a gap between high and low earners continues to remain wide, and it shows a clear and continuing bifurcation. So the lower-income consumers are challenged with interest rates remaining high, gas prices elevated and savings dwindling. So there's a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower-earning households, especially in restaurants and convenience stores. These consumers instead are looking for value as they prepare more meals at home. \n So in contrast, there has been a meaningful growth in travel and accordingly, an increasing hospitality and entertainment sales, driven by the bounce back among the higher earners. And here at Kraft Heinz, we are here to meet the evolving needs and taste of all consumers, whether they're looking for value in serving their family delicious meals at home or seeking culinary delights that they set out on new adventures. They can look to the iconic and trusted brands of Kraft Heinz. \n So for us, it's about having brands that are accessible and available to everyone. I believe we're well positioned to serve all of this consumer for three primary reasons: one, because we are bringing innovative food solutions and faster than ever before; two, because we continue to renovate our core brands for today and tomorrow; and three, because we have the best team in the industry, full stop. We are on track to meet our goals of generating $2 billion incremental net sales from innovation, and the world has taken notice as we were recently named one of the world's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company. But more importantly, we are expanding the choices we offer our consumers so that they don't have to sacrifice, whether it's providing greater value through multipacks, plant-based options such as our newly released NotCo Mac &  Cheese or expanded the choices in our iconic brands such as Zero Sugar Heinz Ketchup. \n Myself, I've been traveling around the world visiting with our employees, and they are consumer obsessed. Their sense of ownership, collaboration and agility is so inspirational. I just want to say thank you to every one of them for their dedication. We are proud of our progress, both far from satisfied, as we continue focusing on serving these consumers and making lives delicious for everyone. \n And with that, I have Andre joining me, so let's open the call for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. \nAndrew Lazar: It looks like KHC is still losing share in North America Retail, though at a more modest pace recently. But in the ACCELERATE platform specifically, your remarks call out holding or gaining share in about 55% of this platform. I guess would you expect this percentage to be higher given the disproportionate allocation of resources to this platform? \n I guess a little more detail on share trends within ACCELERATE would be helpful. And then you mentioned U.S. restaurants softening a bit. Are you starting to see any of that on the flip side benefit at-home eating for your business? And if not, why would that be? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. So thank you, Andrew, for the question. Before I get into the ACCELERATE, let me just at least give you a view of how I'm seeing so far the business performance. If you look at the last 5 weeks, just to remove the noise of Easter, we actually continued to see volume share improvement versus year-to-date, and we're holding dollar share at the same pace in the U.S. So that's at the macro level in the U.S. for our company. \n Now if you look at the ACCELERATE platforms, we actually continue to outperform the other platforms. So far, we are seeing flat in dollar share and growing volume share by 0.2 points. And now let me just break the other 2, and then I'll go back to ACCELERATE. We are losing share in PROTECT platforms, as we continue to see the impact of the decline in SNAP benefits. At the same time, I'm actually pretty excited about the renovations we are seeing in these brands because we are going to be continuing to bring more consumer preference options as we go into the [ sense of the year ]. In our BALANCE part of our portfolio, we are losing share but improving versus a year ago versus year-to-date, primarily driven by coffee. \n Now to your question about ACCELERATE platforms. There's a couple of big brands that are in there that I would like to unpack a little more. If you think about our Mac & Cheese business, which is within the ACCELERATE platform, what you're going to be continuing to see is: one, we are going to start lapping a lot of the headwinds from SNAP. Mac & Cheese was probably one of the more categories that were more actually impacted by SNAP. And as we go into Q2, beginning now in May, you'll see a plethora of new innovations from gluten-free to new options and flavors on our Mac & Cheese business as well as some new, exciting things for the category with some new SKUs that we're bringing in the second half of the year. \n If you look at the other parts of our ACCELERATE platform, that includes our condiments. And the condiments side, what I would say is our category actually is expanding. So we are growing, and we're actually growing volume share. So for us, is how do we continue to drive this growth within the category that has the right tailwinds behind it. And you'll see us continue to expand on the number of offers and innovations and we go into year to go. \n The one note that may be also helpful to understand in the ACCELERATE platform is also we also got out some nonstrategic business, in particular, our Heinz bulk vinegar, which was a business that for us in terms of the economics didn't make us more sense. So we also exited that in the first quarter of the year. So hopefully, that gives you a sense how we're thinking about ACCELERATE within the comfort of our total company. \n I think the second part of your question is on an Away From Home business. And I think let me just say that right now, as I mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant traffic in the U.S., which some of it is impacting our business, but also some of the impact that we saw in the first quarter was due to us exiting some low-margin businesses, as we think about making the right choice for the overall P&L. The actual exit of the business was about $50 million in the first quarter, and that's going to be similar throughout the rest of the year. \n Now for us, as we believe as we go forward, we actually believe that it's about us continuing to drive the importance of Away From Home in new channels. I mentioned in the opening remarks that we're also seeing great opportunities in terms of travel and leisure. And that's an area where our teams are both focused because of the only growth, but also because it allows us to expand margins into those areas. And we also are seeing improvement in terms of distribution of our core businesses as we go into the -- into Q3. \n So again, I feel very good about Away From Home. I think that the trends will continue to improve. And at the same time, for us at Kraft Heinz, we have the scale to make sure that no matter where our consumers are shopping at hotels, where they're going into restaurants or a home, that we have the distribution opportunity for us to kind of make sure that we are there to service anywhere they are. Thanks for the question, Andrew. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: You mentioned inflation in your comments in a few areas. I guess two questions here. First, I don't think you updated us, forgive me if I missed it, but I think last time you were talking about maybe 3% cost inflation for the year. I'm just curious if that's still a reasonable number. \n And then I guess, second, more broadly, there's been a lot of attention paid to cocoa, obviously, but coffee inflation has been fairly notable as well. And I'm just curious, right, even though historically, coffee is somewhat of a pass-through category, do you think that if you and your competitors need, you'll be able and even willing to raise prices to customers as much as you typically might hear? Or do you maybe expect a little more, I guess, pushback than usual? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Ken, for the question. Let me just -- okay, let me start, and then I'll ask Andre to continue to build on it. For us, we are certainly committed to continue to provide families with affordable options. So -- and that means something that we take very seriously. And if you think about 2023, we did end the year with a 3% inflation, but we only pass about 1% pricing to consumers. So we do that very much intentional in a way for us to make sure we are all doing everything we can to offset things so that consumers don't see it. \n Now Andre, if you want to comment a little more in terms of what you see in terms of cost inflation today in the coffee category. \nAndre Maciel: Sure. So yes, we still expect inflation to be in the low single-digit territory, like we said before. So nothing has changed in that regard, with inflation a bit more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than in the shoulder quarters. And that's primarily because of what we call the big 3 commodities: cheese, meat, coffee, which we are seeing particularly in meat and cheese, higher level of inflation happened in Q2, Q3 as we are lapping very favorable comps from last year. So yes, so we don't see any other meaningful change here. And the price that has been taken is very surgical around those categories have been suffering the largest impact. And say cocoa likely is not a relevant part of our portfolio at all. I mean a little bit in Netherlands, but beyond that, there's nothing worth mentioning. And we don't see any reason to believe at this point that we would not be able to continue to pass-through the prices in those commodity categories like it has always been the case. So... \nKenneth Goldman: All right. And if I could ask a quick follow-up. Just the increase in gross margin guidance, coupled with no other changes implies a bit higher SG&A than you previously expected. So just assuming that's accurate, are there any key areas in operating expenses we should think about that are maybe a little bit higher than planned, obviously, not a huge amount? Or maybe the plant shutdown is the primary, I guess, culprit here, so to speak. Just trying to get a little color there, if we could. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: As you saw in CAGNY, we are starting to deploy our brand growth system, which is the method that allows us to continue to improve in our marketing and continue to strengthen our brands. And one of the components of the brand growth system is ensure that we have the sufficient level of marketing across the portfolio. And we've started to see a few selected areas where we need to step up the market investment, thinking on the long term. And we have been gradually approving incremental investments on top of what initially planned on the marketing side, in particular, which I think is a great thing for us. That's all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: I just had two questions. One, just, I guess, a detail. Can you share with us -- I think in the past, you've shared with us how much the SNAP issue has impacted organic sales. So do you have that for the first quarter? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Look, it's never 100% precise. We're talking about the macroeconomic model, but we estimate on the U.S. Retail business back in the range of a few hundred bps negative impact. \nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then a question on the Away From Home in the U.S. and the deceleration. And again, you've quantified the impact of the plant closure, but just can you give us a sense of how much the -- I'm sorry, the impact of the exiting the customer. But can you give us a sense of just how much of the decline is also related to like traffic at restaurants? Just trying to get a sense of the weighting of what's actually driving the slowdown. \n And then also, as you look into the second half, right, where you're expecting -- there's an expectation that there's going to be some recovery, just what underpins that? And I say that in the context of as we're kind of going through earnings season, a lot of the restaurants have incrementally gotten worse or slower. So just is there maybe too much optimism baked into the back half expectation for recovery when it looks like a lot of these restaurant companies are guiding down? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me start and then Andre, if you want to kind of build on that, and thanks for the question, Bryan. First of all, I continue to feel very good about overall strategy globally about Away From Home. Again, it's a business that we are seeing continue to improve outside the U.S. and even as we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant business here in the U.S. \n If I think about the second half, there's a few things that I think we'll feel better as we go into this rest of the year, even in the U.S. here. First of all, we mentioned about this factor impact that we had to close for unplanned maintenance, and that's going to affect us in Q2, and that will be behind us as we go into the second half of the year. The second part is that we are also going to be expanding the number of clients is where you're going to find our portfolio. So there's a number of things that I cannot speak today, but that we'll see as we go into Q3, in which we actually expand the distribution of our products. \n And then the third part is that we are going to continue to drive the focus on us going into attractive higher-margin channels. So again, beyond the restaurants in places like leisure, hospitality and travel, where we are actually seeing better performance because of the higher-income consumer and us getting into those channels in particular. And I think within that channel, we are seeing very successful programs around our Heinz Selection program and hospitality experiences that allow us to bring differentiated type of programs in an industry that until now, we really have in play that strongly. \n So -- and then lastly, what I would say is this is an area where we're going to continue to drive innovation in Away From Home. I mean already, you are seeing how we are taking our Heinz REMIX machine, and we're actually using that and planning it to work in the partnership that we have with BurgerFi, which is now our first restaurant to debut through Heinz REMIX, and that we're going to see that expanding as we go into 2024. \n So the idea is it's not only the fact that we're going to be present, but we're also going to continue to bring innovative in both the channel and the type of products we're going to bring into those channels. And Andre, anything else you could talk about? \nAndre Maciel: I don't think so. \nOperator: Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. \nJohn Baumgartner: Carlos, you highlighted consumer stress as a theme. And I wanted to ask in North America where the volume declines are still more pronounced, things like Mac & Cheese you just detailed for Andrew, but also catch-up in juices. These are categories where private label has been underpenetrated historically, and now you're seeing volumes growing a bit. Are you seeing anything different, whether it's new merchandising by retailers or new price sensitivity among consumers that's changing the dynamic in these categories at all? \n So I'm curious for your take on the pockets of private label share growth. And then maybe a follow-up, are there any specific categories in U.S. Retail where you're expecting material benefits from joint business plans or reinvestment for the duration of this year? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Let me thank you for the question. First on the private label, first of all, we are fortunate that we have such an iconic and beloved brands in our portfolio. And I think what you're seeing is that really, we haven't seen much of a change in terms of our overall gaps versus private label. And I think for us, the benefit that we have had is that over the last 2 years, we have spent a significant amount of energy and continue to renovate our portfolio. And today, we certainly have, in the U.S., renovated almost 100% of our portfolio to make sure that it continues to be relevant for today and tomorrow. \n And I think that, that along with the fact that we are also very much focused on delivering great value to consumers. We have to make sure that as we think about value, that is not just about the price point, it's also about it's worth paying for it. So that's why our focus on driving quality products in a way that is affordable and giving more consumer choices, that is also driving the overall value equation for consumer. So what you're seeing in the data is private label have been gaining share, but really they have stabilized and they're taking more share from other branded players. \n In terms of our JBP, that continues to be a strength of ours. That frankly, it comes out with the fact that we have been building this trust and partnership with our key retailers that allows us to truly leverage the scale of our total portfolio in a way that help us to both drive our distribution of innovation as well as improve our overall performance and execution in store. Because of this partnership, we can do things in store that probably the other peers cannot do. Whether that's when you think about the holiday season coming up now in the summer, we have the range of a portfolio that allows us to create through differentiating and unique value promotions that other people cannot do. So it's something that we continue to elevate and we continue to build on as we strengthened our portfolio and the partnership we have with the key retailers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. \nStephen Robert Powers: Carlos, in the prepared remarks, you talked about the unplanned maintenance that you had to take on one of your Away From Home plants. It seems that you've resolved that issue and you expect the impacts to be isolated to the second quarter. But maybe just a little bit more detail on what transpired there. Any kind of root cause diagnostic? And then just do you expect that to be a pretty quick bounce back in recovery in 3Q? Or is the recovery going to be more spread across the back half? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Yes. Thank you for the question, Steve. Yes, listen, it's not -- I wouldn't give you that much more information than already shared. It was a temporary shutdown in our plant for that unplanned maintenance. Now that particular factory was very much focused on our Away From Home business. And so those continents are places that we can outsource from other places and much within our network of factories. So that's why, in particular, it created a little bit of a dissonance in the Q2 only. And Andre, if you want to give a little more details on the impact in our -- what we see in the range of the portfolio for Q2? \nAndre Maciel: Yes. So as we said in prepared remarks, production has resumed and is gradually going back towards the prior level. Not there yet, but production has resumed. And that's why I expect the impact to be -- we do expect production to be fully back on track within the quarter. And then the impact on top line, as we said, will be in the range of 50 to 100 bps to the total company growth, which is a function of how fast you can really bring the production fully up to speed. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Palmer: Two questions. First, a follow-up on Foodservice. What is your general Foodservice assumption going forward that underlines your mid-single-digit organic growth that you have planned for the year? Is that, that you basically expected that current trends industry-wide and globally will remain similar level that you saw in the first quarter or improving from there? \n And then secondly, just Oscar Mayer and the beverage business, both were declining maybe mid-single digits or so in measured channels in the first quarter. Could you maybe talk about the challenges and general plans and prospects for improvement for each of those? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Maybe, Andre, if you can comment on Away From Home and maybe I can build on the Oscar Mayer and beverage business. \nAndre Maciel: Yes. So first, if you think about our second half, as we said, we expect to be on algo throughout the entire second half. And if you think about our 3 pillars of growth, first, on Emerging Markets, as we said, Q1 came in line with what we said will happen mid-single digit, primarily because of the shipment phasing in Brazil. So as we head into Q2, we do expect Emerging Markets to be now very close at our long-term algo, and in the second half fully on the long-term algo. So that's a point comes from that roughly, maybe a little more. \n On the U.S. Retail business, as a function of industry improving gradually, volume continues to improve. All the innovation, renovation, Carlos mentioned a few examples. We do expect to be, if not on algo, at least approaching algo, so that will be a big contributor for the improvement as we head into the second half. \n And then finally, on Away From Home, like we don't need to be fully on algo to deliver our numbers in the second half, and that's not what we're contemplating. So we don't expect Away From Home to be fully back on algo. Even though on the international side, we should be back there in the U.S. where we think the dynamics of the industry is what give us a pause. We do expect improvement and a gradual improvement on the industry plus the business risk. But I mean, I think we're still a bit on a pause to see how much of the industry will recover. But again, we don't need to be fully on algo in the U.S. Away From Home to deliver our guidance for the second half. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: And then just going deeper on the Oscar Mayer and beverage question, David. But I would say, if you go back to our CAGNY presentation, those are businesses that are in 2 different portfolio roles within our company. So our beverage business is within our PROTECT business, in which we actually are allocating resources in order to protect the profitability through the renovation across those brands to drive the growth. \n So if you think about some of the key brands there, you see that our MiO liquid concentrate in which we actually just renovated our entire kind of design or product. We have a new campaign, a marketing campaign focused on the wellness of the brand can offer. If you think about Crystal Light, we just debuted our first major innovation in 10 years, and we're launching a number of new and exciting functional benefits. If you think -- and then for us is how do we continue to drive that sense of focus on renovating on those particular products because we know they are differentiated, and we think they are well positioned for the long term. \n In the Oscar Mayer part of our BALANCE business, which, again, we are making sure we're making the right investments in order to protect our distribution. And at the same time, we also are being thoughtful about how we are going to manage a business that are very exposed to the commodity side of things. So we are being also thoughtful of making sure we are protecting the top line, while at the same time, making sure we have the right gross margins management in order for us to make it work within the entire Kraft Heinz portfolio. \nAndre Maciel: The other thing I'll add on the BALANCE portfolio as a whole, you saw in prepared remarks that overall, the BALANCE declined 4% in the quarter, but the gross profit dollars grew 5%. So as we have said before, we continue to -- it's a balancing act, and we continue to make sure that we don't starve those brands of the core investments to sustain their business. But you should not expect an average growth coming from there. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. \nRobert Moskow: Andre, I think you might have already answered this, but mathematically, I think the guidance now for Foodservice implies a 50 basis point reduction to the overall company compared to, I think, the high single-digit guidance you had last quarter. So does the rest of the portfolio need to offset that? Is anything -- are you expecting anything to be a little better than you expected? Or is it just kind of absorbed? \n And then secondly, I think the slide said that you're seeing improvement in retail trends in U.S. Retail, maybe that's just versus a year ago. But can I assume that despite the market shares being down versus a year ago, do you need to make any big -- any adjustments to your marketing plan for 2024? Is there any increased price investment or advertising investment that needs to be made that's different from what you expected? \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Andre, do you want to start with Away from Home, and I can comment on the retail trends? \nAndre Maciel: Yes. First, as you said, the 50 bps that we mentioned in the prepared remarks should be clear, is linkage, the 50 to 100 bps expansion of plant shutdown and is focused on the second quarter. So we do not expect impact from that as we go into the second half. So as we head into the second half, as I said before, we do expect Emerging Markets to be fully back on algo. We do expect the U.S. Retail, North America Retail to continue to improve, like improve in Q1. We expect to improve more in Q2 and then more in the second half, like as a function, again, of lapping SNAP and a lot of contribution from innovation and renovation. \n And on the Away From Home, we do expect the rest of the world to gradually improve and get close, if not, at algo. And then the U.S. becomes then the question  we don't need to be at mid-single digit in the second half for us to achieve our guidance. But we do expect a gradual improvement on industry. And I think we are seeing that from different sources as well. I think that there is a general expectation of that together with all the business wins that we have done, and I think that we're going to be past the situation with the plant as we had in the second half. \nCarlos Abrams-Rivera: Thank you, Andre. And on the retail trends, I guess, I'll go back to the point at the beginning, which is we are seeing volume share improvements versus in the last 5 weeks into year-to-date. So we are seeing that the momentum is happening already. And for us, what we are going to be doing is focus on those things we can control, which is as you go into the year to go, you'll see us continue to drive the renovation of our brands, like I mentioned, whether it's in our PROTECT platforms and ACCELERATE, which is driving more innovation, as you'll see now, begin now in Q2 and we continue to step up through the rest of the year. And then these margins are marketing investments. \n Andre mentioned earlier that part of the reason we're taking some of those gross margin dollars and investing back in the business is because now we are deploying a brand growth system that allows us to think about how do we make sure we're being smart about where to spend and places that maybe we haven't been spending at sufficient levels. So you are, in fact, going to see that continued focus on not driving the right dollars against the right priorities for us to drive the retail growth. And thank you for the question, Rob. \nAnne-Marie Megela: And thank you, everyone, for joining us. This concludes our earnings call for the first quarter '24. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Andre Maciel",
            "content": "Sure. So yes, we still expect inflation to be in the low single-digit territory, like we said before. So nothing has changed in that regard, with inflation a bit more concentrated in Q2 and Q3 than in the shoulder quarters. And that's primarily because of what we call the big 3 commodities: cheese, meat, coffee, which we are seeing particularly in meat and cheese, higher level of inflation happened in Q2, Q3 as we are lapping very favorable comps from last year. So yes, so we don't see any other meaningful change here. And the price that has been taken is very surgical around those categories have been suffering the largest impact. And say cocoa likely is not a relevant part of our portfolio at all. I mean a little bit in Netherlands, but beyond that, there's nothing worth mentioning. And we don't see any reason to believe at this point that we would not be able to continue to pass-through the prices in those commodity categories like it has always been the case. So... I don't think so. Yes. So as we said in prepared remarks, production has resumed and is gradually going back towards the prior level. Not there yet, but production has resumed. And that's why I expect the impact to be -- we do expect production to be fully back on track within the quarter. And then the impact on top line, as we said, will be in the range of 50 to 100 bps to the total company growth, which is a function of how fast you can really bring the production fully up to speed. Yes. So first, if you think about our second half, as we said, we expect to be on algo throughout the entire second half. And if you think about our 3 pillars of growth, first, on Emerging Markets, as we said, Q1 came in line with what we said will happen mid-single digit, primarily because of the shipment phasing in Brazil. So as we head into Q2, we do expect Emerging Markets to be now very close at our long-term algo, and in the second half fully on the long-term algo. So that's a point comes from that roughly, maybe a little more. \n On the U.S. Retail business, as a function of industry improving gradually, volume continues to improve. All the innovation, renovation, Carlos mentioned a few examples. We do expect to be, if not on algo, at least approaching algo, so that will be a big contributor for the improvement as we head into the second half. \n And then finally, on Away From Home, like we don't need to be fully on algo to deliver our numbers in the second half, and that's not what we're contemplating. So we don't expect Away From Home to be fully back on algo. Even though on the international side, we should be back there in the U.S. where we think the dynamics of the industry is what give us a pause. We do expect improvement and a gradual improvement on the industry plus the business risk. But I mean, I think we're still a bit on a pause to see how much of the industry will recover. But again, we don't need to be fully on algo in the U.S. Away From Home to deliver our guidance for the second half. The other thing I'll add on the BALANCE portfolio as a whole, you saw in prepared remarks that overall, the BALANCE declined 4% in the quarter, but the gross profit dollars grew 5%. So as we have said before, we continue to -- it's a balancing act, and we continue to make sure that we don't starve those brands of the core investments to sustain their business. But you should not expect an average growth coming from there. Yes. First, as you said, the 50 bps that we mentioned in the prepared remarks should be clear, is linkage, the 50 to 100 bps expansion of plant shutdown and is focused on the second quarter. So we do not expect impact from that as we go into the second half. So as we head into the second half, as I said before, we do expect Emerging Markets to be fully back on algo. We do expect the U.S. Retail, North America Retail to continue to improve, like improve in Q1. We expect to improve more in Q2 and then more in the second half, like as a function, again, of lapping SNAP and a lot of contribution from innovation and renovation. \n And on the Away From Home, we do expect the rest of the world to gradually improve and get close, if not, at algo. And then the U.S. becomes then the question  we don't need to be at mid-single digit in the second half for us to achieve our guidance. But we do expect a gradual improvement on industry. And I think we are seeing that from different sources as well. I think that there is a general expectation of that together with all the business wins that we have done, and I think that we're going to be past the situation with the plant as we had in the second half."

            "name": "Carlos Abrams-Rivera",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Anne-Marie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So before we begin our Q&A, I'd just like to provide some perspective on our top-up session here at Kraft Heinz, our consumers. And while we've seen a notable uptick in consumer sentiment in the first quarter, there is a gap between high and low earners continues to remain wide, and it shows a clear and continuing bifurcation. So the lower-income consumers are challenged with interest rates remaining high, gas prices elevated and savings dwindling. So there's a clear pullback of restaurant spend by these lower-earning households, especially in restaurants and convenience stores. These consumers instead are looking for value as they prepare more meals at home. \n So in contrast, there has been a meaningful growth in travel and accordingly, an increasing hospitality and entertainment sales, driven by the bounce back among the higher earners. And here at Kraft Heinz, we are here to meet the evolving needs and taste of all consumers, whether they're looking for value in serving their family delicious meals at home or seeking culinary delights that they set out on new adventures. They can look to the iconic and trusted brands of Kraft Heinz. \n So for us, it's about having brands that are accessible and available to everyone. I believe we're well positioned to serve all of this consumer for three primary reasons: one, because we are bringing innovative food solutions and faster than ever before; two, because we continue to renovate our core brands for today and tomorrow; and three, because we have the best team in the industry, full stop. We are on track to meet our goals of generating $2 billion incremental net sales from innovation, and the world has taken notice as we were recently named one of the world's Top 50 Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company. But more importantly, we are expanding the choices we offer our consumers so that they don't have to sacrifice, whether it's providing greater value through multipacks, plant-based options such as our newly released NotCo Mac &  Cheese or expanded the choices in our iconic brands such as Zero Sugar Heinz Ketchup. \n Myself, I've been traveling around the world visiting with our employees, and they are consumer obsessed. Their sense of ownership, collaboration and agility is so inspirational. I just want to say thank you to every one of them for their dedication. We are proud of our progress, both far from satisfied, as we continue focusing on serving these consumers and making lives delicious for everyone. \n And with that, I have Andre joining me, so let's open the call for Q&A. Yes. So thank you, Andrew, for the question. Before I get into the ACCELERATE, let me just at least give you a view of how I'm seeing so far the business performance. If you look at the last 5 weeks, just to remove the noise of Easter, we actually continued to see volume share improvement versus year-to-date, and we're holding dollar share at the same pace in the U.S. So that's at the macro level in the U.S. for our company. \n Now if you look at the ACCELERATE platforms, we actually continue to outperform the other platforms. So far, we are seeing flat in dollar share and growing volume share by 0.2 points. And now let me just break the other 2, and then I'll go back to ACCELERATE. We are losing share in PROTECT platforms, as we continue to see the impact of the decline in SNAP benefits. At the same time, I'm actually pretty excited about the renovations we are seeing in these brands because we are going to be continuing to bring more consumer preference options as we go into the [ sense of the year ]. In our BALANCE part of our portfolio, we are losing share but improving versus a year ago versus year-to-date, primarily driven by coffee. \n Now to your question about ACCELERATE platforms. There's a couple of big brands that are in there that I would like to unpack a little more. If you think about our Mac & Cheese business, which is within the ACCELERATE platform, what you're going to be continuing to see is: one, we are going to start lapping a lot of the headwinds from SNAP. Mac & Cheese was probably one of the more categories that were more actually impacted by SNAP. And as we go into Q2, beginning now in May, you'll see a plethora of new innovations from gluten-free to new options and flavors on our Mac & Cheese business as well as some new, exciting things for the category with some new SKUs that we're bringing in the second half of the year. \n If you look at the other parts of our ACCELERATE platform, that includes our condiments. And the condiments side, what I would say is our category actually is expanding. So we are growing, and we're actually growing volume share. So for us, is how do we continue to drive this growth within the category that has the right tailwinds behind it. And you'll see us continue to expand on the number of offers and innovations and we go into year to go. \n The one note that may be also helpful to understand in the ACCELERATE platform is also we also got out some nonstrategic business, in particular, our Heinz bulk vinegar, which was a business that for us in terms of the economics didn't make us more sense. So we also exited that in the first quarter of the year. So hopefully, that gives you a sense how we're thinking about ACCELERATE within the comfort of our total company. \n I think the second part of your question is on an Away From Home business. And I think let me just say that right now, as I mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant traffic in the U.S., which some of it is impacting our business, but also some of the impact that we saw in the first quarter was due to us exiting some low-margin businesses, as we think about making the right choice for the overall P&L. The actual exit of the business was about $50 million in the first quarter, and that's going to be similar throughout the rest of the year. \n Now for us, as we believe as we go forward, we actually believe that it's about us continuing to drive the importance of Away From Home in new channels. I mentioned in the opening remarks that we're also seeing great opportunities in terms of travel and leisure. And that's an area where our teams are both focused because of the only growth, but also because it allows us to expand margins into those areas. And we also are seeing improvement in terms of distribution of our core businesses as we go into the -- into Q3. \n So again, I feel very good about Away From Home. I think that the trends will continue to improve. And at the same time, for us at Kraft Heinz, we have the scale to make sure that no matter where our consumers are shopping at hotels, where they're going into restaurants or a home, that we have the distribution opportunity for us to kind of make sure that we are there to service anywhere they are. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Thank you, Ken, for the question. Let me just -- okay, let me start, and then I'll ask Andre to continue to build on it. For us, we are certainly committed to continue to provide families with affordable options. So -- and that means something that we take very seriously. And if you think about 2023, we did end the year with a 3% inflation, but we only pass about 1% pricing to consumers. So we do that very much intentional in a way for us to make sure we are all doing everything we can to offset things so that consumers don't see it. \n Now Andre, if you want to comment a little more in terms of what you see in terms of cost inflation today in the coffee category. As you saw in CAGNY, we are starting to deploy our brand growth system, which is the method that allows us to continue to improve in our marketing and continue to strengthen our brands. And one of the components of the brand growth system is ensure that we have the sufficient level of marketing across the portfolio. And we've started to see a few selected areas where we need to step up the market investment, thinking on the long term. And we have been gradually approving incremental investments on top of what initially planned on the marketing side, in particular, which I think is a great thing for us. That's all. Look, it's never 100% precise. We're talking about the macroeconomic model, but we estimate on the U.S. Retail business back in the range of a few hundred bps negative impact. Let me start and then Andre, if you want to kind of build on that, and thanks for the question, Bryan. First of all, I continue to feel very good about overall strategy globally about Away From Home. Again, it's a business that we are seeing continue to improve outside the U.S. and even as we are seeing some of the slowing of the restaurant business here in the U.S. \n If I think about the second half, there's a few things that I think we'll feel better as we go into this rest of the year, even in the U.S. here. First of all, we mentioned about this factor impact that we had to close for unplanned maintenance, and that's going to affect us in Q2, and that will be behind us as we go into the second half of the year. The second part is that we are also going to be expanding the number of clients is where you're going to find our portfolio. So there's a number of things that I cannot speak today, but that we'll see as we go into Q3, in which we actually expand the distribution of our products. \n And then the third part is that we are going to continue to drive the focus on us going into attractive higher-margin channels. So again, beyond the restaurants in places like leisure, hospitality and travel, where we are actually seeing better performance because of the higher-income consumer and us getting into those channels in particular. And I think within that channel, we are seeing very successful programs around our Heinz Selection program and hospitality experiences that allow us to bring differentiated type of programs in an industry that until now, we really have in play that strongly. \n So -- and then lastly, what I would say is this is an area where we're going to continue to drive innovation in Away From Home. I mean already, you are seeing how we are taking our Heinz REMIX machine, and we're actually using that and planning it to work in the partnership that we have with BurgerFi, which is now our first restaurant to debut through Heinz REMIX, and that we're going to see that expanding as we go into 2024. \n So the idea is it's not only the fact that we're going to be present, but we're also going to continue to bring innovative in both the channel and the type of products we're going to bring into those channels. And Andre, anything else you could talk about? Let me thank you for the question. First on the private label, first of all, we are fortunate that we have such an iconic and beloved brands in our portfolio. And I think what you're seeing is that really, we haven't seen much of a change in terms of our overall gaps versus private label. And I think for us, the benefit that we have had is that over the last 2 years, we have spent a significant amount of energy and continue to renovate our portfolio. And today, we certainly have, in the U.S., renovated almost 100% of our portfolio to make sure that it continues to be relevant for today and tomorrow. \n And I think that, that along with the fact that we are also very much focused on delivering great value to consumers. We have to make sure that as we think about value, that is not just about the price point, it's also about it's worth paying for it. So that's why our focus on driving quality products in a way that is affordable and giving more consumer choices, that is also driving the overall value equation for consumer. So what you're seeing in the data is private label have been gaining share, but really they have stabilized and they're taking more share from other branded players. \n In terms of our JBP, that continues to be a strength of ours. That frankly, it comes out with the fact that we have been building this trust and partnership with our key retailers that allows us to truly leverage the scale of our total portfolio in a way that help us to both drive our distribution of innovation as well as improve our overall performance and execution in store. Because of this partnership, we can do things in store that probably the other peers cannot do. Whether that's when you think about the holiday season coming up now in the summer, we have the range of a portfolio that allows us to create through differentiating and unique value promotions that other people cannot do. So it's something that we continue to elevate and we continue to build on as we strengthened our portfolio and the partnership we have with the key retailers. Yes. Thank you for the question, Steve. Yes, listen, it's not -- I wouldn't give you that much more information than already shared. It was a temporary shutdown in our plant for that unplanned maintenance. Now that particular factory was very much focused on our Away From Home business. And so those continents are places that we can outsource from other places and much within our network of factories. So that's why, in particular, it created a little bit of a dissonance in the Q2 only. And Andre, if you want to give a little more details on the impact in our -- what we see in the range of the portfolio for Q2? Maybe, Andre, if you can comment on Away From Home and maybe I can build on the Oscar Mayer and beverage business. And then just going deeper on the Oscar Mayer and beverage question, David. But I would say, if you go back to our CAGNY presentation, those are businesses that are in 2 different portfolio roles within our company. So our beverage business is within our PROTECT business, in which we actually are allocating resources in order to protect the profitability through the renovation across those brands to drive the growth. \n So if you think about some of the key brands there, you see that our MiO liquid concentrate in which we actually just renovated our entire kind of design or product. We have a new campaign, a marketing campaign focused on the wellness of the brand can offer. If you think about Crystal Light, we just debuted our first major innovation in 10 years, and we're launching a number of new and exciting functional benefits. If you think -- and then for us is how do we continue to drive that sense of focus on renovating on those particular products because we know they are differentiated, and we think they are well positioned for the long term. \n In the Oscar Mayer part of our BALANCE business, which, again, we are making sure we're making the right investments in order to protect our distribution. And at the same time, we also are being thoughtful about how we are going to manage a business that are very exposed to the commodity side of things. So we are being also thoughtful of making sure we are protecting the top line, while at the same time, making sure we have the right gross margins management in order for us to make it work within the entire Kraft Heinz portfolio. Andre, do you want to start with Away from Home, and I can comment on the retail trends? Thank you, Andre. And on the retail trends, I guess, I'll go back to the point at the beginning, which is we are seeing volume share improvements versus in the last 5 weeks into year-to-date. So we are seeing that the momentum is happening already. And for us, what we are going to be doing is focus on those things we can control, which is as you go into the year to go, you'll see us continue to drive the renovation of our brands, like I mentioned, whether it's in our PROTECT platforms and ACCELERATE, which is driving more innovation, as you'll see now, begin now in Q2 and we continue to step up through the rest of the year. And then these margins are marketing investments. \n Andre mentioned earlier that part of the reason we're taking some of those gross margin dollars and investing back in the business is because now we are deploying a brand growth system that allows us to think about how do we make sure we're being smart about where to spend and places that maybe we haven't been spending at sufficient levels. So you are, in fact, going to see that continued focus on not driving the right dollars against the right priorities for us to drive the retail growth. And thank you for the question, Rob."
