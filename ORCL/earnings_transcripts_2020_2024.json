Now, I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks Ken and good afternoon, everyone. I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12th earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology, and most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC, and other health authorities around the world or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers and I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud infrastructure and autonomous database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology. Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, were also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud. COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility, social and machine learning built-in. Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35% and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and Vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%. As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year, and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter and the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double-digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates, and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.1 billion. During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency, due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter, because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholder through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. Now, before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe, the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings. We are confident in our growth, because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of three distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate. The declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward. Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for One, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion. Third, we have four decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud@Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows. Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These two are getting to be a large number. Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart. In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year. Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1. Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency, and assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's generation-one cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal. The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change, and it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.95% [ph] availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. Furthermore, soon all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular \u2013 all about popular things would be serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity, and even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud. Okay. The Oracle public cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud@Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering. To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom. And that's the other \u2013 and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about. Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom's services has increased almost 20 times since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp, where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom -- our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes, through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew. Okay. Another win, in addition to Zoom 8x8, a great example of our sales process, the customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS, moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved, that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal, for 8x8, and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users. Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a three-year contract, they built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud@Customer data center, in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI public cloud services to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 public cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements. Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest ninth-- world's ninth largest investment firm plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications. Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud@Customer, in the customer's own words, 'The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud@Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50%, while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, our team could save time and effort. And focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.' Quest Diagnostics, Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing. And they continue to invest in the Oracle cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud@Customer environment, so that the company could migrate, MyQuest portal an anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business, business functions. Another win, Santander Bank, Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud@Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation. Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's public cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and Autonomous Data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment. Verizon Business Group, a four-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission and business critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 public cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPs, I/Os per second with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata Cloud Services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle Public Cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle. Another win, Cybereason, a four-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with endpoint protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's bare metal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics. Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year. Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a three-year contract. Moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000 user e-business suite application with the goal of lowering costs, while improving security, reliability and performance. This wins open doors to the next phase of SGS's transition to the Public Cloud, focused on peering Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud. Another win, Synacor, three-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shutdown a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. Sky.One, three-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISVs that again has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle cloud. Another one, another win for infrastructure. Manappuram Finance in India, a five-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center. With our newly launched, Hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site. And I'll stop with -- and the last infrastructure win, I'll talk about is Altair, a three-year contract, five times the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI. There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So, right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins. Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly cloud ERP 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago. Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions. We've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player. Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic. First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries, with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over two million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system. Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me, go look at the reports. They're online. Okay. So, where we really distinguished ourselves in addition to capabilities and also other things was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report, look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top and Workday is right in the middle is right in the middle with 3.0 far behind us. Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM, amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern, accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR payroll system, all right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting. Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP and EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing an Oracle Fusion ERP. A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations. Another \u2013 a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management. A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide ranging program to modernize their corporate system and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating cost. Another win in the quarter, ERP win in the quarter was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia. Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins. I'm going to move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger, North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from a smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chat box integrated into HCM, and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. You can do a lot of things expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone, makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM. A very large U.S. Managed healthcare company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.  Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Okay.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could move to the Q&A portion of the call now?\nOperator: All right. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much for taking my question. Larry, you talked about OCI quite a bit in your prepared remarks, but I don\u2019t think we can hear too much about the success you\u2019re having. In particular, the traction outside your typical customer base with wins like Zoom and 8x8 in the quarter, very impressive. Can you talk more about the impact that the pandemic might be having on your Cloud Infrastructure business? And any change in your confidence level there based on what you're seeing?\nLarry Ellison: Well, I think what we\u2019re seeing is now that some people are actually trying. The people \u2013 the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business providing their application. Its not -- I mean, it\u2019s great we have Verizon, we have end user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think, they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where there -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud. Not everyone believes, in fact, most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle, and we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger, so they must be better. Once they look, we win. And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in. We've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS, and we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you very, Larry. Much clear.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you both very much for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the launch of Cloud@Customer Gen 2 that you mentioned with Autonomous Database. And with the ability now to be able to run Autonomous on-premise, can you give us a sense for how you see this accelerating adoption of Autonomous? And then I just was wondering, when you factor in both now that it's available in the cloud, on OCI and on-premise, how much of a tailwind, Safra, is this factored into your view that you think that revenue growth could accelerate in fiscal year 2021? Is this one of the biggest levers to your estimations there? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Let me just answer the end of that, and then, Larry, I think you should cover it in much more detail. I have not counted on that in my underlying assumptions, but I do believe that it is going to be incredibly successful. And as our initial customers are using it, this is, I believe, a very, very important, very differentiated capability that only we have. And so, though I've not relied on it for the acceleration, I do believe that it will be an incredible tailwind for us and not just this year, but really for years to come. Anyway, Larry, why don't you comment on Cloud@Customer and Autonomous Database?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in a public cloud. And we had this huge installed base. We have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle database. But that's sitting on-premise. And a large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database. The only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud@Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing. So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud@Customer, Exadata -- Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering. And so, now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise can now use Cloud@Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying public cloud, except we put the database cloud, the Cloud@Customer in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- attached to our public cloud and we manage it for you. Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now, all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just works. So we think \u2013 we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of \u2013 all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of co-existence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian-Bowler.\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: Great. Thank you, Larry and Safra for taking my questions. And I'm really glad that everybody is safe and well, definitely important right now. I'd like to pivot and focus on the applications business, especially Safra, given your commentary around growing parts of the business getting larger than the shrinking parts. Can you elaborate a little bit on what trends you're seeing in application software? And perhaps, in particular, I'm interested in knowing if you're seeing any accelerations in customer migrations from on-premise into your cloud, and just any color and insights will be greatly appreciated? Thank you so much.\nSafra Catz: Certainly. So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to a very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that customers that are \u2013 they use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud, and so we've been incredibly successful with the with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base has only recently started to upgrade and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financials, now they're really starting as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that. And one of the things, by the way, that was a very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers and they wanted to \u2013 they like having the suite. They wanted a full suite, of course our financials and HCM, but in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product and now we have many references in the supply chain, of course including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers, start with us many of our customers grow over time. So, they'll start with some module, and year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So, we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So, some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some role in additional capabilities. And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them, because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it, so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP, and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionalities can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So, we have a lot of momentum right now in this business.\nLarry Ellison: Yeah. And I'd like to add to what Safra said. We rolled out the new module. That's something that Oracle made available in our cloud. But then, our customers will be able to access that new module at home, if they\u2019ll take it out. So, and the fact is, all these cloud systems are accessible at home, obviously. They are accessible on your smartphone. So, they're just much more accessible than the previous generation of technology. And that's made a huge difference where people are able to continue operating out of their homes. If you are an accountant, and you're using an Oracle financial system, there is no reason to get in your car and drive to the office. You have the same exact tools sitting in your home office on your laptop computer.\nSafra Catz: Yeah. I mean these capabilities are not only -- they are modern, they are mobile. You can get to them. But not only that, you can work with them by voice, totally modern UI, much more capable. I mean, it is literally night and day between 21st century technology, which came in incredibly handy during this pandemic, and all 20th century stuff, some of these customers are using. And that's why the moment they get started with us and build the confidence, they realize that this is very, very important and critical for their success going forward. Thank you.\nSarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you. That was very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question for the day will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you, and appreciate you have time to take my question. Safra, my understanding was that Company didn't furlough employees. They didn't lay any one off. You treated your employees well. Your license sales were down a bit, and yet you beat big on margin. Can you give us some color on exactly what's driving such a big margin improvement? Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Well, I think you know that we have a very long history of being very careful about how we spend money. And during this pandemic, obviously, there were no people flying around. Only our essential employees that had to go in to somewhere did any kind of traveling at all. We had moved entirely to work-from-home. And so we didn't have T&E expenses. In addition, of course, our compensation expenses were down because of commissions. That's clear. And we really just tried to carefully watch our spending, while continuing to invest in our future. We are very, very optimistic about the strength of these products. I cannot say that enough. And as a result, we're also very optimistic about the capability of our field to kind of, fan out and share this with our prospects. And so we want to make sure we have a very strong technical team in place and a very strong field. So we just did what are the -- the reasonable smart things to do. Everyone, the entire senior management team, Larry and I don't take the credit, it is really the credit of the entire management team that just got a lot more careful about extraneous spending and we were able to bring this in.\nLarry Ellison: I'd like to comment also. I think, I'll add a little color to that. I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses and this is another example where we have executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean, we don't care that this SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. You know, there are a bunch of businesses we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower margin businesses and we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise; like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our infrastructure, our OCI Gen 2, Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products. So as some of our lower margin businesses get smaller and our higher margin businesses get bigger, it's really what's going -- what's going on is a mix shift, the fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though -- if you look at Oracle by and large over the last several years someone will say, guy, I mean, their top-line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom-line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs. That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the topline is challenged. I don't mean to take away anything from the team, which did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those two things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you again for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing.\nOperator: Thank you. Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's Oracle quarter four 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks Ken and good afternoon, everyone. I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12th earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology, and most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC, and other health authorities around the world or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers and I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud infrastructure and autonomous database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology. Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, were also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud. COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility, social and machine learning built-in. Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35% and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and Vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%. As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year, and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter and the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double-digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates, and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.1 billion. During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency, due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter, because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholder through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. Now, before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe, the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings. We are confident in our growth, because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of three distinct groups: one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate. The declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward. Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for One, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion. Third, we have four decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud@Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows. Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These two are getting to be a large number. Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart. In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year. Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1. Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency, and assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Okay. Let me just answer the end of that, and then, Larry, I think you should cover it in much more detail. I have not counted on that in my underlying assumptions, but I do believe that it is going to be incredibly successful. And as our initial customers are using it, this is, I believe, a very, very important, very differentiated capability that only we have. And so, though I've not relied on it for the acceleration, I do believe that it will be an incredible tailwind for us and not just this year, but really for years to come. Anyway, Larry, why don't you comment on Cloud@Customer and Autonomous Database? Certainly. So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to a very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that customers that are \u2013 they use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud, and so we've been incredibly successful with the with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base has only recently started to upgrade and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financials, now they're really starting as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that. And one of the things, by the way, that was a very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers and they wanted to \u2013 they like having the suite. They wanted a full suite, of course our financials and HCM, but in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product and now we have many references in the supply chain, of course including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers, start with us many of our customers grow over time. So, they'll start with some module, and year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So, we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So, some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some role in additional capabilities. And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them, because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it, so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP, and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionalities can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So, we have a lot of momentum right now in this business. Yeah. I mean these capabilities are not only -- they are modern, they are mobile. You can get to them. But not only that, you can work with them by voice, totally modern UI, much more capable. I mean, it is literally night and day between 21st century technology, which came in incredibly handy during this pandemic, and all 20th century stuff, some of these customers are using. And that's why the moment they get started with us and build the confidence, they realize that this is very, very important and critical for their success going forward. Thank you. Well, I think you know that we have a very long history of being very careful about how we spend money. And during this pandemic, obviously, there were no people flying around. Only our essential employees that had to go in to somewhere did any kind of traveling at all. We had moved entirely to work-from-home. And so we didn't have T&E expenses. In addition, of course, our compensation expenses were down because of commissions. That's clear. And we really just tried to carefully watch our spending, while continuing to invest in our future.

And as a result, we're also very optimistic about the capability of our field to kind of, fan out and share this with our prospects. And so we want to make sure we have a very strong technical team in place and a very strong field. So we just did what are the -- the reasonable smart things to do. Everyone, the entire senior management team, Larry and I don't take the credit, it is really the credit of the entire management team that just got a lot more careful about extraneous spending and we were able to bring this in."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's generation-one cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal. The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change, and it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.95% [ph] availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. Furthermore, soon all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular \u2013 all about popular things would be serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity, and even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud. Okay. The Oracle public cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud@Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering. To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom. And that's the other \u2013 and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about. Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom's services has increased almost 20 times since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp, where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom -- our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes, through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew. Okay. Another win, in addition to Zoom 8x8, a great example of our sales process, the customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS, moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved, that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal, for 8x8, and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users. Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a three-year contract, they built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud@Customer data center, in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI public cloud services to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 public cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements. Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest ninth-- world's ninth largest investment firm plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications. Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud@Customer, in the customer's own words, 'The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud@Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50%, while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, our team could save time and effort. And focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.' Quest Diagnostics, Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing. And they continue to invest in the Oracle cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud@Customer environment, so that the company could migrate, MyQuest portal an anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business, business functions. Another win, Santander Bank, Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud@Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation. Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's public cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and Autonomous Data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment. Verizon Business Group, a four-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission and business critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 public cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPs, I/Os per second with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata Cloud Services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle Public Cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle. Another win, Cybereason, a four-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with endpoint protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's bare metal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics. Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year. Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a three-year contract. Moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000 user e-business suite application with the goal of lowering costs, while improving security, reliability and performance. This wins open doors to the next phase of SGS's transition to the Public Cloud, focused on peering Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud. Another win, Synacor, three-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shutdown a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. Sky.One, three-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISVs that again has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle cloud. Another one, another win for infrastructure. Manappuram Finance in India, a five-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center. With our newly launched, Hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site. And I'll stop with -- and the last infrastructure win, I'll talk about is Altair, a three-year contract, five times the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI. There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So, right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins. Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly cloud ERP 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago. Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions. We've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player. Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic. First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries, with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over two million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system. Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me, go look at the reports. They're online. Okay. So, where we really distinguished ourselves in addition to capabilities and also other things was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report, look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top and Workday is right in the middle is right in the middle with 3.0 far behind us. Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM, amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern, accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR payroll system, all right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting. Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP and EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing an Oracle Fusion ERP. A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations. Another \u2013 a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management. A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide ranging program to modernize their corporate system and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating cost. Another win in the quarter, ERP win in the quarter was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia. Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins. I'm going to move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger, North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from a smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chat box integrated into HCM, and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. You can do a lot of things expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone, makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM. A very large U.S. Managed healthcare company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.  Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra. Well, I think what we're seeing is now that some people are actually trying. The people \u2013 the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business providing their application. Its not -- I mean, it's great we have Verizon, we have end user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think, they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where there -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud. Not everyone believes, in fact, most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle, and we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger, so they must be better. Once they look, we win. And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in. We've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS, and we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth. Okay. So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in a public cloud. And we had this huge installed base. We have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle database. But that's sitting on-premise. And a large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database. The only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud@Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing. So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud@Customer, Exadata -- Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering. And so, now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise can now use Cloud@Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying public cloud, except we put the database cloud, the Cloud@Customer in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- attached to our public cloud and we manage it for you. Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now, all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just works. So we think \u2013 we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of \u2013 all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of co-existence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer. Yeah. And I'd like to add to what Safra said. We rolled out the new module. That's something that Oracle made available in our cloud. But then, our customers will be able to access that new module at home, if they'll take it out. So, and the fact is, all these cloud systems are accessible at home, obviously. They are accessible on your smartphone. So, they're just much more accessible than the previous generation of technology. And that's made a huge difference where people are able to continue operating out of their homes. If you are an accountant, and you're using an Oracle financial system, there is no reason to get in your car and drive to the office. You have the same exact tools sitting in your home office on your laptop computer. I'd like to comment also. I think, I'll add a little color to that. I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses and this is another example where we have executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean, we don't care that this SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. You know, there are a bunch of businesses we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower margin businesses and we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise; like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our infrastructure, our OCI Gen 2, Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products. So as some of our lower margin businesses get smaller and our higher margin businesses get bigger, it's really what's going -- what's going on is a mix shift, the fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though -- if you look at Oracle by and large over the last several years someone will say, guy, I mean, their top-line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom-line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs. That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the topline is challenged. I don't mean to take away anything from the team, which did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those two things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Sir?\nKen Bond: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz.  As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.  And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue.  It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5% and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year.  We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base.  As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues.  Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.  Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.  Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.  Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4.  So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year.  In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue.  My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary.  My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.  Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. There are two key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers.  Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday.  And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote.  Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM.  We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite.  CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion service.  Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And Participia [ph] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business.  I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud.  I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura.  Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them.  Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint.  This one is really interesting. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite.  Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer.  Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Operator, if we could please queue up the audience for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. \nHeather Bellini: I was just wondering, Safra, Larry, if you could talk a little bit about the rebound that you mentioned that you can start seeing show up in the numbers, in particular, around your database business. I know in Q1, you called out a little bit of dislocation, and it looks like things are starting to progress in the direction that you've been telling us about. But is there anything you could share with us to kind of give us more detail about what exactly you think is driving this? Is it things like OCI, for example, as well? And then how -- Safra, you mentioned that you might be able to share with us in May when you get a little more stability in the picture from a macro perspective kind of how you see this progressing, but any high-level thoughts you would be comfortable sharing with us now about kind of the acceleration that you're seeing in terms of how we should think about it going forward?\nSafra Catz: Okay. So I will start and then, Larry, you can add what you'd like. Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers.  In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that, that is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. I want to amplify on what Safra means by great products. So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing.  But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores, we do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2.  So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad?\nBrad Zelnick: Larry or Safra, I just wanted to ask a question about the hardware business, which I know isn't typically in focus for most investors, but I know many customers have been anxiously anticipating the availability of Autonomous Database to be supported on Cloud at Customer. So my question is, can you give us any sort of update on the impact that supply constraints might be having on the hardware business? And in any way, can that impact the availability of Autonomous to be shipping on Cloud at Customer?\nSafra Catz: So there was a little bit of an impact actually in Q3 as certain components were in short supply. And so in fact, once again, Q3 would have been even higher but for some shortages in components to our suppliers and to our suppliers' suppliers as a result of the coronavirus in China. I think that we're trying to work through all of that, and we'll see what the availability is in Q4. We think we -- some impact may continue, but my guidance on this does include our ability to deliver some but not all of what we could possibly sell in Q4.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. I'd like to comment as well. Our Exadata cloud -- database Cloud at Customer product is actually made up of the same components as conventional servers. Therefore, we can reallocate the parts away from the conventional servers into the Exadata machines. So -- and the Exadata machines are much higher value because they have a much larger software component to them when we sell them, and the Exadata machines are Gen2 Cloud at Customer. So I think you'll see us -- if we have to do some reallocation away from plain old commodity servers into our Exadata machines, and thereby, if there is a shortfall, it should be in the lower -- the less expensive commodity servers, less profitable commodity servers and the high-value, high-margin Cloud at Customer servers, we're going to do -- work very, very hard to meet all of those orders.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo.\nPhilip Winslow: Congrats on a great Q3. I just wanted to focus in on the apps business. Obviously, Safra, you called out the acceleration there but also some pretty strong growth rates, ERP Cloud, 38%, HCM Cloud Fusion, 27%. So 2 questions here. First, what's actually driving this growth? Is this your existing customers flipping over from on-premise to the cloud? Or is it net new customers to Oracle? And I guess a question for Larry, too. What are you hearing about sort of why customers are choosing you? Or how much is the breadth of your ERP suite impact that buying decision?\nSafra Catz: So let me just say -- sorry. First of all, let me just answer your exact question, which is, yes, yes, yes, yes. Is it new customers? Yes. Is it upgrading customers from e-business suite? Yes. Is it taking customers from our biggest competitors? Yes. Is it replacing out some of our SaaS competitors? Yes. It is all those things. All right. Now I'll let Larry talk. Go ahead.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, \"I don't think they have a better UI,\" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, \"Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17.\"  And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment.  And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: Can you talk a little bit, like we're obviously in uncertain times but you guys have been in uncertain times before. So can you maybe contrast a little bit Oracle today with its recurring revenue stream whether there's -- where we were in 2008, where this -- and where we were in 2001? And then also talk a little bit about what you see on renewals around the database but also the cloud.\nSafra Catz: Yes. So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what -- at least what this quarter did and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more.  So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong, and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. I'd like to add a couple of comments. One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate.  The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site.  So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation.\nOperator: And our next question is a line from Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Congratulations on the quarter. You increased your buyback authorization this quarter. How should we think about how you will use the buyback given the market downturn? Also, how should we think about your ability to support the dividend, expand the dividend, given the economic downturn? It seems to be a very positive statement you're making. I'd like to get whatever color you can on that.\nSafra Catz: There's no question we can support our dividend with ease, okay. And any kind of increased dividend, we could support that. Also, I mean our business is very strong, as is obvious. It generates very large amounts of cash. We believe, as you can tell, I'm not going to comment on future buyback, but obviously, you can tell we have been buying back our stock. We think it's an incredible deal. It's basically gone on clearance sale in the past few days, and we think it's an enormous -- it's a fantastic investment. And it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with.  So our business has hit an obvious inflection. I've mentioned that it would accelerate in the second half. I never would have imagined that we would have the kind of reaction worldwide by companies and governments. So I really -- I've done my best at modeling what Q4 will look like. To the extent that next year is -- that this stabilizes, I believe we will be just continuing on in our -- we've changed our model and it's becoming obvious. So I think our stock is obviously a bargain. It was a bargain before, and we are authorized to buy back, and we will let you know after we have done it.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.\nMichael Turits: Nice to see strong results, particularly in a tough time. I want to come back to applications. Applications accelerated in this quarter and Fusion apps continue to grow at high rates. Is there anything left in terms of headwinds that could keep you from seeing further acceleration in app subscription this year and next? And where do you think that growth rate could end up for this year?\nSafra Catz: The business is fantastic, okay? It's obviously accelerating. The base of the business keeps growing. We are winning, we are winning constantly. The products are \u2013 it gets stronger every quarter, and it really ultimately is well on its way. Larry, I'm sorry, I interrupted you.\nLawrence Ellison: No. I was going to say, in applications, the new news is, I mentioned it last quarter, that we are engaged with lots, more than 10 of SAP's very largest customers. In terms of doing -- actually looking at taking a couple of divisions of these very large companies. And we're talking about American companies, Asian companies, German companies, large German companies that are giving us divisions to put Fusion into. And there is -- one company has given us multiple divisions because the question they're trying to answer is, \"Can I replace all of SAP throughout my company with Fusion? And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company.\"  So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming.  We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be.\nOperator: And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Ken Bond for any closing remarks.\nKen Bond: Sure. Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. With that, let me turn it back to the operator for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue.  It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5% and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year.  We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base.  As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues.  Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.  Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes.  Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.  Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4.  So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year.  In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue.  My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary.  My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020.  Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Okay. So I will start and then, Larry, you can add what you'd like. Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers.  In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that, that is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that. So there was a little bit of an impact actually in Q3 as certain components were in short supply. And so in fact, once again, Q3 would have been even higher but for some shortages in components to our suppliers and to our suppliers' suppliers as a result of the coronavirus in China. I think that we're trying to work through all of that, and we'll see what the availability is in Q4. We think we -- some impact may continue, but my guidance on this does include our ability to deliver some but not all of what we could possibly sell in Q4. So let me just say -- sorry. First of all, let me just answer your exact question, which is, yes, yes, yes, yes. Is it new customers? Yes. Is it upgrading customers from e-business suite? Yes. Is it taking customers from our biggest competitors? Yes. Is it replacing out some of our SaaS competitors? Yes. It is all those things. All right. Now I'll let Larry talk. Go ahead. Yes. So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what -- at least what this quarter did and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more.  So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world.

            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. There are two key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers.  Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday.  And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote.  Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM.  We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite.  CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion service.  Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And Participia [ph] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business.  I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud.  I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura.  Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them.  Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint.  This one is really interesting. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite.  Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer.  Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken. Yes. I want to amplify on what Safra means by great products. So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing.  But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores, we do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2.  So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue. Yes. I'd like to comment as well. Our Exadata cloud -- database Cloud at Customer product is actually made up of the same components as conventional servers. Therefore, we can reallocate the parts away from the conventional servers into the Exadata machines. So -- and the Exadata machines are much higher value because they have a much larger software component to them when we sell them, and the Exadata machines are Gen2 Cloud at Customer. So I think you'll see us -- if we have to do some reallocation away from plain old commodity servers into our Exadata machines, and thereby, if there is a shortfall, it should be in the lower -- the less expensive commodity servers, less profitable commodity servers and the high-value, high-margin Cloud at Customer servers, we're going to do -- work very, very hard to meet all of those orders. Yes. Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, \"I don't think they have a better UI,\" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, \"Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17.\"  And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment.  And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic. Yes. I'd like to add a couple of comments. One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate.  The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site.  So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation. No. I was going to say, in applications, the new news is, I mentioned it last quarter, that we are engaged with lots, more than 10 of SAP's very largest customers. In terms of doing -- actually looking at taking a couple of divisions of these very large companies. And we're talking about American companies, Asian companies, German companies, large German companies that are giving us divisions to put Fusion into. And there is -- one company has given us multiple divisions because the question they're trying to answer is, \"Can I replace all of SAP throughout my company with Fusion? And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company.\"  So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming.  We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be."

Ken?\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken. But before I start, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark\u2019s passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us. As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high-end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth, and given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller non-strategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate, as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix. Of late, I\u2019ve been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right. At Oracle, we\u2019ve upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move and know we have thousands of customers and references, our own experience, adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation. To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP Cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don\u2019t report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we\u2019ve saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP Cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM Cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We\u2019ve also made it easier for our managers and employees, as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we\u2019re saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process. In sales, we\u2019re using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own Data Cloud to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we\u2019ve seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in Sales Cloud each year. And with CPQ Cloud, ordering is much faster and easier, with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers move to the cloud. In addition, we\u2019ve adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions, while at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter. Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future. Now on to the numbers. I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. Currency Q \u2013 for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue. Cloud and on-premise license revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7%, as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low-30%s, including Fusion ERP up 38% and Fusion HCM up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while Data Cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12 months basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200%. But off a small base for now, on a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just four days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud@Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 Cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they\u2019re the same number, but it\u2019s just rounding similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of 1% \u2013 of nearly 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and between \u2013 and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those one-time tax benefits \u2013 the tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020. And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. As I\u2019ve said before, there are two key product areas that will determine Oracle\u2019s future in the cloud, Cloud ERP Applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear number one in both of these two giant applications and infrastructure market segments, we\u2019ll enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP, with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest Cloud ERP competitors, Workday, and they claim to have a few 100 ERP customers. Workday\u2019s lack of success in Cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in Cloud HCM. More and more, we\u2019re seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we\u2019re beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX customer experience applications in sales and service and in marketing. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP\u2019s installed base is very vulnerable. We\u2019ve already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP\u2019s biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP\u2019s largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate the Fusion ERP. SAP\u2019s customer base is up for grabs. They didn\u2019t rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle. We\u2019re already declared number one in the Cloud ERP market as measured in market share and our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternatives to SAP\u2019s old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We\u2019re very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner in this generation Cloud ERP business. Now, let\u2019s look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP, Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson, Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I\u2019m not mentioning any HCM \u2013 associated HCM deals, because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys, maybe next quarter, I will put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal. So you can see, because you\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list, and that\u2019s the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back-office, very important. Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Global Companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR, financial services, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NETSCOUT, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children\u2019s Healthcare, the hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit Travel services, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that\u2019s what they bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. The suite, a lot of people are buying multiple modules, it\u2019s not just ERP, it\u2019s ERP. It\u2019s EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It\u2019s supply chain. It\u2019s manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Airport Terminal Services \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, now I\u2019m on my HCM Group. I\u2019m in the HCM Group, they\u2019re all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. Apparel Bosco Retail, HCM. Banque Saudi Fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, other energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM. Graybar Electric bought HCM. Hologic, HCM. HUS at the hospital, both of the hospitals in Finland, run by the federal government in Finland bought HCM. Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining, again, this is my HCM list, big energy company, an SAP stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big gas company, Energy, HCM. Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM. Texas Children\u2019s Hospital bought HCM and [indiscernible] brought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a big energy bought HCM. MEDNAX Health Care, HCM. Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKYA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing. Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service. Okay, let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming number one, with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud, though, I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly, because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database. Autonomous Database is the world\u2019s only Autonomous Database. What does that mean? That means, when you configure the system, you don\u2019t do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The recent Capital One lost all that data at AWS is, because one of the Capital One people made a configuration here. You can\u2019t make configuration errors with the Autonomous Database, because human beings don\u2019t configure the system. A lot of these above the fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget the patch systems. Remember that one. They patched some, but not all of the systems. And Equifax, Equifax it was a patchy stocks [ph] database, didn\u2019t get patched. They didn\u2019t find them all. Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected And by the way, they detected that security flow at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn\u2019t get around to patching. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You had to schedule downtime. You don\u2019t schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You can\u2019t see Autonomous Database, while the database is still running. But you don\u2019t capture database. The robots, our robots attach the database. That\u2019s why it\u2019s Autonomous. There\u2019s no human labor. So there\u2019s no human error. So if you are willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes. This is a gigantic technology advantage, by the way, and we\u2019re ten times faster than anything Amazon apps. That means, we\u2019re much cheaper than anything Amazon has. Much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our Public Cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our Autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, Autonomous Database business off a small base. Admittedly, it\u2019s a relatively new product, but it\u2019s on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company\u2019s history. Now this triple-digit growth rate, I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned. Our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now, when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they\u2019re already \u2013 I mean, all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our Public Cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people \u2013 government agencies, defense ministries, people have that. They need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And next \u2013 and over the next few months, we\u2019re rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floor \u2013 on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we\u2019re in our second-generation of this. We did it early. We did a reasonable first-generation job, but the second time is a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was \u2013 can be installed in a day. No, the first one we installed in four days. We expect to do that even faster. There\u2019ll be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software, because it just syncs up with our Public Cloud and you\u2019re up and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. The \u2013 okay. The \u2013 when that happens, we think by any measure, we will be not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem, but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold onto our database franchise in a big way. So it\u2019s interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secured infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I\u2019ll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers period. We\u2019re adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And, again, we\u2019ll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end \u2013 a year from now, that\u2019s very, very exciting. Now, let\u2019s look at some of our Autonomous Database in Gen2 Infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. [indiscernible] international big manufacturing firm. Albertson\u2019s, this another \u2013 this is more synergy that I\u2019ve got to mention where people buy our applications. They buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be infrastructure \u2013 Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So, yes, when you buy ERP, you might also by HCM. When you buy ERP, you\u2019re also going to buy the Fusion Data Warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and Infrastructure product. You\u2019re going to buy analytics in our Gen2 data center. You\u2019re going to be an infrastructure customer, as well as an application customer and we see a lot of overlap. We often see see people buying suites of applications, ERP, plus HCM, plus sales and things like that. But also applications plus infrastructure. Aon Financial Services. Biogen bought Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cisco Systems, again, Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Data Warehouse. Clearstream services, same thing, Gen2 Infrastructure Autonomous Data Warehouse. Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane \u2013 the aircraft manufacturer, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. Equity Bank of Kenya, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure.

Swiss Post, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Target, based in the United States, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Technip, energy company, but I\u2019ve mentioned that bought I believe, the HCM, ERP, bought the full suite and Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Database. The Boston Globe, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database. Thermos, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Cybersoft, Autonomous Database. Tideworks Netherlands, Gen2 Infrastructure. Tokyo Gas and Electric, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. TriMark USA, Gen2 Infrastructure.

With that, I will turn it over to the audience for questions.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. Thank you, Larry. Holly, if you could please prepare the audience for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James.\nMichael Turits: Hey, good evening, everybody. Safra, it was great to see that you reaffirmed your guidance for the full-year per revenue acceleration and double-digit EPS growth. But with the 3Q guide, it does suggest a very strong fourth-quarter on top of what was the fourth \u2013 strong fourth quarter than last year. So can you give us a little bit of visibility into what\u2019s driving that confidence.? And also I know it\u2019s early, but given what that means for fourth quarter, what does it mean in terms of what it implies about fiscal 2021?\nSafra Catz: So we\u2019ve got everything finally out and available. And as Larry and I both mentioned, we\u2019ve got Cloud@Customer. We have a lot of orders for that, that we have not deployed yet. So we\u2019ve got a lot of demand there. We\u2019ve got Autonomous Database. We\u2019ve got new versions of Autonomous Database on track. We\u2019ve got the entire Fusion suite rolling even \u2013 including all of the additional modules have all been continuously upgraded. So we\u2019ve got an immense amount of demand. And we have enormous pipelines and our conversion rates are increasing. And so the pipe has just expanded so dramatically than I know we\u2019re going to have more bookings, but also previous bookings as those deals are ramping up and more users are using the products were very, very upbeat about the second-half. But even more so next year, we believe that the momentum we will have in the second-half of this year will more than carry through to 2021.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks very much.\nSafra Catz: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much for the time and I\u2019m going to try and get away with two questions. But I guess, the first one, Safra, as you mentioned about license this quarter, it was a little lighter than what, I think, people were expecting. I know we\u2019re talking about a big base. But if there\u2019s anything you could call out in terms of whether it\u2019s the sales force reorg or just macro or whatever in terms of the results in the quarter on that line. And then I know just covering the company for a while, given the lumpiness historically between Q2 and Q3, I know sometimes deals push from one quarter to the next and typically, it\u2019s better to just average those two quarters. But how do you feel about the outlook for the Q3 license number? And then I just have one follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind.\nSafra Catz: I generally feel very good about the Q3 license number, as you said, it is lumpy. The one thing we do have is that the GBUs, which, of course, not a giant part of our license business, but are significant. They have moved and their cloud products have become available. And I do expect that most of the orders for new services in the GBUs will come through as Cloud Services instead of just plain License. But I don\u2019t think that will be as significant. I do expect that licenses, in fact, will be just fine in Q3 other than the GBU piece.\nHeather Bellini: Okay. And then just my follow-up. I mean, these calls just still don\u2019t feel the same without Mark being on them. And with all due respect to him to his passing just knowing how hard it is going to be to replace him, I mean, is there anything to share with us regarding you getting some \u2013 getting someone to kind of help take his place in some of the responsibilities that you\u2019ve taken over?\nLawrence Ellison: Okay. This is Larry. I know how to answer that question, because I get the question is, so how\u2019s our search for a second CEO guy? Remember, when we announced two CEOs, the first time was people thought that was a bit odd. And so now people are finding that we have one CEO is a bit odd, two CEOs \u2013 so it\u2019s so simple. So let me make it very simple. How\u2019s our search going for the new \u2013 for a second CEO, we don\u2019t have plans. We have no plans for having a second CEO, it was an unusual situation, where Mark and Safra were an absolutely fantastic team. But we have complete confidence in our existing management team. We\u2019re doing a lot of recruiting and you\u2019ll see a lot of announcements at the next layer down that we\u2019re hiring a bunch of people at the next layer down who are potential CEOs, when both Safra and I retire and which is not anytime soon. And so we\u2019re going to strengthen the management team, but one of the strategies for strengthening that team is not to hire a second CEO.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you very much.\nKen Bond: Next question, please. Thank you, Heather.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. Larry, the momentum in Autonomous Database is fantastic, growing over a 100% in your Public Cloud. But having been in market now for over a year, I know investors are wondering when we might see an inflection in your financial results from Autonomous. And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you\u2019re making it available on Gen2 Cloud@Customer. How should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle\u2019s history?\nLawrence Ellison: Well, no. I mean, there \u2013 either in terms of a technological breakthrough. Well, I guess, we\u2019re the first commercial relational database.\nBrad Zelnick: Wow.\nLawrence Ellison: The very beginning, that\u2019s kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So that we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded \u2013 that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world\u2019s information. So I would say, Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It\u2019s \u2013 it is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that\u2019s in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually, everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is \u2013 it takes a while when you introduce an all new products. The good news is, we have a huge installed base here. It takes a while for that \u2013 for us to shift a, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we\u2019ve seen a lot of early adopters. But the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think eventually the only database will offer, it\u2019s Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else. And by the way, at Autonomous Database, it\u2019s only available in Q4. If we put a cloud in \u2013 if we put our cloud in your data center, that\u2019s our Exadata machine and our Middleware machines and all of that is in our storage in your data center and our Public Cloud. So it \u2013 we think it will be consumed in one of those two ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business from a financial standpoint will more than double or triple or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look out. Now, of course, when you are in your business, it\u2019s all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much will sell over the next 18 months. That\u2019s kind of tricky. Now we don\u2019t have that many data points. We have four quarters of data points. And then the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I\u2019ve been saying is none of us ever seen an adoption rate like this before.\nBrad Zelnick: Fantastic. Thank you, Larry.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus in on the applications business. Obviously, you saw a nice tick back up here quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year growth rate. I guess, the question to Safra and I guess, Larry, too. What do you think about the sort of the different curves that buildup that business? Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about in the past some of the headwinds from things like Data Cloud and then also some of the wins that we saw on your Fusion, Fusion ERP and NetSuite this quarter? Where are we when we stack all those curves together? Are we past for those headwinds and we\u2019re now looking at sort of acceleration from here? In other words, Q1 was a trough or just help us kind of, Larry, take that up, if you could?\nSafra Catz: So let me get started and then Larry can add when he needs to add. So first of all, the Data Cloud has stabilized. I don\u2019t know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us. In that whole business, it has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP Cloud is now such that it\u2019s in the thousands. We\u2019ve many, many references. And what happens in our business is that, once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been to some extent leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of first availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers, and so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, a 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite. Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers have realized that SAPs\u2019 offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP\u2019s technology, you don\u2019t get a 100 new features every quarter. There\u2019s a simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who are \u2013 who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It\u2019s an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with and that\u2019s clearly showing up in our other segments and, of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front-office, where we\u2019ve got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. I think a lot of SAP\u2019s \u2013 again, in the mid-market, where we are replacing a lot of SAP customers and we\u2019ve got them live and we have references. But right at the very impacts of SAP\u2019s customer base, they\u2019re top 50 customers around the world. They\u2019re \u2013 looking at this one particular implementation that where we expect to go live in March of next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a billion-dollar SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-life, their current stuff in 2025. So if you\u2019re a big SAP customer, you\u2019ve got to make it \u2013 that some people have bought \u2013 actually bought ahead, actually bought as we\u2019re having in the cloud with no plan \u2013 with no really good plan to implement it. It\u2019s a five-year implementation. They\u2019re getting price quotes of a billion-dollars for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA and that\u2019s the only change. Basically, that\u2019s the only change and it\u2019s hosted. It\u2019s not cloud. There is no cloud. Anyway, I want to say, well, it\u2019s easy for Oracle and say, go to SAP\u2019s website and try to find the SAP Cloud for ERP. I mean, you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You can find it for little SurveyMonkey, and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot. They forgot to write ERP, that\u2019s your business and they forgot to rewrite ERP there. There are projects that they had to do that whole business by design fails, they canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP customers. They can\u2019t go to Workday. Workday can\u2019t even handle mid-market ERP. So we\u2019re at \u2013 so believe me, they want an alternatives to SAP, makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we\u2019ve just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they\u2019re not putting their business than any risks. And that\u2019s why this one particular giant implementation they\u2019re watching closely. But by the way, they\u2019re not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of German, lots of them are working with \u2013 these are German customers the core of SAP are working with us. And taking some of their \u2013 moving some of their divisions already on some of their divisions to Oracle\u2019s Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They\u2019ve gone that far. They don\u2019t want to continue with its obsolete code. This is \u2013 this opportunity is gigantic, because we have one European customer on \u2013 competitor on-premise. They don\u2019t have a cloud offering. That\u2019s SAP. And we\u2019ve got one ERP Cloud competitor that just as not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground. It doesn\u2019t scale there a lot. There are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be \u2013 to get what used to be in the old world called gates share for ERP and getting \u2013 like Microsoft Office to be \u2013 the Microsoft Office of ERP, where \u2013 and it\u2019s sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP\u2019s largest customers. Yes, we can do this. We can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud.\nPhil Winslow: Thank you, Larry.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my questions. Autonomous Database sounds like, it\u2019s really starting to gain traction. Given the shift of sales personnel to selling Autonomous, can you give us some more color specifically? Specifically, are you seeing the customers buying the required modules as license or they including it with the cloud? Are you seeing changes in the size of the customer, size of the pipeline, the time it takes from customer interest to adoption. Any of that would be really appreciated?\nLawrence Ellison: Okay, I\u2019m happy to do that. I think the most interesting thing that\u2019s going on is, we\u2019ve decided to take, if you will, in AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling our $30,000 deal to a $100,000 deal, because in a $30,000 deal, we can close in four weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they under \u2013 once they actually get their hands on Autonomous Database and they have working app, they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start some new land and expand. So we\u2019re selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach, again, is to \u2013 and most of it is not BYOL, because they\u2019re small. I mean some of it is. Not \u2013 yes, some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP. When we had ERP, people moving our e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. In the early days in Cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we\u2019re actually seeing new logos and database. But again, most of them are our customers, but they\u2019re not using their existing licenses. They\u2019re going ahead and using a standard cloud and license, what we call [indiscernible]. They pay us as we get. You pay for what you use. I mean, it\u2019s the promise of the cloud. And we\u2019re getting in thousands of these, because we think the best selling techniques for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch it backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There\u2019s nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on. And again, it\u2019s working very, very well. I think it\u2019s working very, very well, because we\u2019re seeing just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month.\nKen Bond: Great. Next question, please?\nOperator: Our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore.\nStewart Kirk Materne: Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Safra, I was just wondering if you could comment on just sort of the geographic landscape for you all. It looked like Europe was perhaps a little bit softer in your other geographies this quarter. Maybe that\u2019s just macro. I was wondering if you could just add a little bit color on sort of what you\u2019re seeing across the different theaters? Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Yes. This quarter, EMEA only grew in the single digits. Some of the other regions did grow in the high double digits, some very high double digits. And I think there\u2019s nothing really special going on one way or the other. Some of it\u2019s just the way the quarter falls out for them. But overall, our business remains very strong. And I think that next quarter could be completely different. So it was \u2013 it\u2019s really nothing. We\u2019re not seeing a massive change even month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter from what it looked like. Obviously, there are some regions doing very, very well for a number of different reasons as they get to roll out new capabilities. We\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got data centers opening and have opened very, very successfully in Latin America and in Asia and in Japan. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of usage and increase in some of those areas, which helped explain some of the big growth in some of those areas. But EMEA, I think, we will see \u2013 there\u2019s nothing special, in particular. I have no real color to add and we\u2019ll see what happens after today\u2019s selection in the UK.\nStewart Kirk Materne: Sounds good. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking to you. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Holly for closing. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken. But before I start, I'd like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark's passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us. As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high-end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth, and given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller non-strategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate, as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix. Of late, I've been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses: feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right. At Oracle, we've upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move and know we have thousands of customers and references, our own experience, adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation. To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP Cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don't report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we've saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP Cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM Cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We've also made it easier for our managers and employees, as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we're saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process. In sales, we're using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own Data Cloud to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we've seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in Sales Cloud each year. And with CPQ Cloud, ordering is much faster and easier, with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers move to the cloud. In addition, we've adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions, while at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter. Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future. Now on to the numbers. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. Currency Q \u2013 for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue. Cloud and on-premise license revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7%, as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low-30%s, including Fusion ERP up 38% and Fusion HCM up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while Data Cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12 months basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200%. But off a small base for now, on a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just four days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud@Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 Cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they're the same number, but it's just rounding similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of 1% \u2013 of nearly 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and between \u2013 and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those one-time tax benefits \u2013 the tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020. And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. So we've got everything finally out and available. And as Larry and I both mentioned, we've got Cloud@Customer. We have a lot of orders for that, that we have not deployed yet. So we've got a lot of demand there. We've got Autonomous Database. We've got new versions of Autonomous Database on track. We've got the entire Fusion suite rolling even \u2013 including all of the additional modules have all been continuously upgraded. So we've got an immense amount of demand. And we have enormous pipelines and our conversion rates are increasing. And so the pipe has just expanded so dramatically than I know we're going to have more bookings, but also previous bookings as those deals are ramping up and more users are using the products were very, very upbeat about the second-half. But even more so next year, we believe that the momentum we will have in the second-half of this year will more than carry through to 2021. Sure. I generally feel very good about the Q3 license number, as you said, it is lumpy. The one thing we do have is that the GBUs, which, of course, not a giant part of our license business, but are significant. They have moved and their cloud products have become available. And I do expect that most of the orders for new services in the GBUs will come through as Cloud Services instead of just plain License. But I don't think that will be as significant. I do expect that licenses, in fact, will be just fine in Q3 other than the GBU piece. So let me get started and then Larry can add when he needs to add. So first of all, the Data Cloud has stabilized. I don't know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us. In that whole business, it has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP Cloud is now such that it's in the thousands. We've many, many references. And what happens in our business is that, once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been to some extent leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of first availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers, and so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, a 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite. Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers have realized that SAPs' offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP's technology, you don't get a 100 new features every quarter. There's a simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who are \u2013 who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It's an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with and that's clearly showing up in our other segments and, of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front-office, where we've got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted. Yes. This quarter, EMEA only grew in the single digits. Some of the other regions did grow in the high double digits, some very high double digits. And I think there's nothing really special going on one way or the other. Some of it's just the way the quarter falls out for them. But overall, our business remains very strong. And I think that next quarter could be completely different. So it was \u2013 it's really nothing. We're not seeing a massive change even month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter from what it looked like. Obviously, there are some regions doing very, very well for a number of different reasons as they get to roll out new capabilities. We've got a lot of \u2013 we've got data centers opening and have opened very, very successfully in Latin America and in Asia and in Japan. And so we've got a lot of usage and increase in some of those areas, which helped explain some of the big growth in some of those areas. But EMEA, I think, we will see \u2013 there's nothing special, in particular. I have no real color to add and we'll see what happens after today's selection in the UK."

            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. As I've said before, there are two key product areas that will determine Oracle's future in the cloud, Cloud ERP Applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear number one in both of these two giant applications and infrastructure market segments, we'll enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP, with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest Cloud ERP competitors, Workday, and they claim to have a few 100 ERP customers. Workday's lack of success in Cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in Cloud HCM. More and more, we're seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we're beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX customer experience applications in sales and service and in marketing. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP's installed base is very vulnerable. We've already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP's biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP's largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate the Fusion ERP. SAP's customer base is up for grabs. They didn't rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle. We're already declared number one in the Cloud ERP market as measured in market share and our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternatives to SAP's old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We're very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner in this generation Cloud ERP business. Now, let's look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP, Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson, Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I'm not mentioning any HCM \u2013 associated HCM deals, because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys, maybe next quarter, I will put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal. So you can see, because you'll \u2013 I'll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list, and that's the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back-office, very important. Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Global Companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR, financial services, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NETSCOUT, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children's Healthcare, the hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit Travel services, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that's what they bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. The suite, a lot of people are buying multiple modules, it's not just ERP, it's ERP. It's EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It's supply chain. It's manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Airport Terminal Services \u2013 I'm sorry, now I'm on my HCM Group. I'm in the HCM Group, they're all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. Apparel Bosco Retail, HCM. Banque Saudi Fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, other energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM. Graybar Electric bought HCM. Hologic, HCM. HUS at the hospital, both of the hospitals in Finland, run by the federal government in Finland bought HCM. Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining, again, this is my HCM list, big energy company, an SAP stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big gas company, Energy, HCM. Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM. Texas Children's Hospital bought HCM and [indiscernible] brought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a big energy bought HCM. MEDNAX Health Care, HCM. Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKYA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing. Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service. Okay, let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming number one, with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud, though, I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly, because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database. Autonomous Database is the world's only Autonomous Database. What does that mean? That means, when you configure the system, you don't do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The recent Capital One lost all that data at AWS is, because one of the Capital One people made a configuration here. You can't make configuration errors with the Autonomous Database, because human beings don't configure the system. A lot of these above the fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget the patch systems. Remember that one. They patched some, but not all of the systems. And Equifax, Equifax it was a patchy stocks [ph] database, didn't get patched. They didn't find them all. Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected And by the way, they detected that security flow at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn't get around to patching. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You had to schedule downtime. You don't schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You can't see Autonomous Database, while the database is still running. But you don't capture database. The robots, our robots attach the database. That's why it's Autonomous. There's no human labor. So there's no human error. So if you are willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes. This is a gigantic technology advantage, by the way, and we're ten times faster than anything Amazon apps. That means, we're much cheaper than anything Amazon has. Much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our Public Cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our Autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, Autonomous Database business off a small base. Admittedly, it's a relatively new product, but it's on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company's history. Now this triple-digit growth rate, I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned. Our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now, when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they're already \u2013 I mean, all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our Public Cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people \u2013 government agencies, defense ministries, people have that. They need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And next \u2013 and over the next few months, we're rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floor \u2013 on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we're in our second-generation of this. We did it early. We did a reasonable first-generation job, but the second time is a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was \u2013 can be installed in a day. No, the first one we installed in four days. We expect to do that even faster. There'll be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software, because it just syncs up with our Public Cloud and you're up and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. The \u2013 okay. The \u2013 when that happens, we think by any measure, we will be not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem, but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold onto our database franchise in a big way. So it's interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secured infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I'll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers period. We're adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And, again, we'll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end \u2013 a year from now, that's very, very exciting. Now, let's look at some of our Autonomous Database in Gen2 Infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. [indiscernible] international big manufacturing firm. Albertson's, this another \u2013 this is more synergy that I've got to mention where people buy our applications. They buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be infrastructure \u2013 Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So, yes, when you buy ERP, you might also by HCM. When you buy ERP, you're also going to buy the Fusion Data Warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and Infrastructure product. You're going to buy analytics in our Gen2 data center. You're going to be an infrastructure customer, as well as an application customer and we see a lot of overlap. We often see see people buying suites of applications, ERP, plus HCM, plus sales and things like that. But also applications plus infrastructure. Aon Financial Services. Biogen bought Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cisco Systems, again, Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Data Warehouse. Clearstream services, same thing, Gen2 Infrastructure Autonomous Data Warehouse. Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane \u2013 the aircraft manufacturer, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. Equity Bank of Kenya, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Fastenal Company, a big distribution company in the United States, Gen2 Infrastructure. Healthcare Services Corp., Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Database. Interact, Gen2 Infrastructure. King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. The Core University, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Manchester, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. MGM Entertainment, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Provident Healthcare Services, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Schenker Logistics in Germany, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Soar [ph] Gen2 Infrastructure. Swiss Post, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Target, based in the United States, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Technip, energy company, but I've mentioned that bought I believe, the HCM, ERP, bought the full suite and Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Database. The Boston Globe, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database. Thermos, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Cybersoft, Autonomous Database. Tideworks Netherlands, Gen2 Infrastructure. Tokyo Gas and Electric, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. TriMark USA, Gen2 Infrastructure. Walgreens, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Autonomous Transaction Processing, Gen2 Infrastructure. Wizink Bank, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. Zim, the big shipping company, you've seen a lot of Maersk, you see them in Zim on lots and lots of containers, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing and Gen2 Infrastructure. AXA Equitable Life Insurance, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Banco de Chile, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. Baxter Healthcare, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cigna Corporate Services, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. Eventbrite, Gen2 Infrastructure. Ford Motor Company, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Warehouse. Mary Kay, Gen2 Infrastructure. Samsung Electronics, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. VeriFone, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database and Autonomous Transaction Processing. With that, I will turn it over to the audience for questions. Okay. This is Larry. I know how to answer that question, because I get the question is, so how's our search for a second CEO guy? Remember, when we announced two CEOs, the first time was people thought that was a bit odd. And so now people are finding that we have one CEO is a bit odd, two CEOs \u2013 so it's so simple. So let me make it very simple. How's our search going for the new \u2013 for a second CEO, we don't have plans. We have no plans for having a second CEO, it was an unusual situation, where Mark and Safra were an absolutely fantastic team. But we have complete confidence in our existing management team. We're doing a lot of recruiting and you'll see a lot of announcements at the next layer down that we're hiring a bunch of people at the next layer down who are potential CEOs, when both Safra and I retire and which is not anytime soon. And so we're going to strengthen the management team, but one of the strategies for strengthening that team is not to hire a second CEO. Well, no. I mean, there \u2013 either in terms of a technological breakthrough. Well, I guess, we're the first commercial relational database. The very beginning, that's kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So that we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded \u2013 that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world's information. So I would say, Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It's \u2013 it is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that's in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually, everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is \u2013 it takes a while when you introduce an all new products. The good news is, we have a huge installed base here. It takes a while for that \u2013 for us to shift a, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we've seen a lot of early adopters. But the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think eventually the only database will offer, it's Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else. And by the way, at Autonomous Database, it's only available in Q4. If we put a cloud in \u2013 if we put our cloud in your data center, that's our Exadata machine and our Middleware machines and all of that is in our storage in your data center and our Public Cloud. So it \u2013 we think it will be consumed in one of those two ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business from a financial standpoint will more than double or triple or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look out. Now, of course, when you are in your business, it's all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much will sell over the next 18 months. That's kind of tricky. Now we don't have that many data points. We have four quarters of data points. And then the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I've been saying is none of us ever seen an adoption rate like this before. Yes. I think a lot of SAP's \u2013 again, in the mid-market, where we are replacing a lot of SAP customers and we've got them live and we have references. But right at the very impacts of SAP's customer base, they're top 50 customers around the world. They're \u2013 looking at this one particular implementation that where we expect to go live in March of next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a billion-dollar SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-life, their current stuff in 2025. So if you're a big SAP customer, you've got to make it \u2013 that some people have bought \u2013 actually bought ahead, actually bought as we're having in the cloud with no plan \u2013 with no really good plan to implement it. It's a five-year implementation. They're getting price quotes of a billion-dollars for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA and that's the only change. Basically, that's the only change and it's hosted. It's not cloud. There is no cloud. Anyway, I want to say, well, it's easy for Oracle and say, go to SAP's website and try to find the SAP Cloud for ERP. I mean, you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You can find it for little SurveyMonkey, and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot. They forgot to write ERP, that's your business and they forgot to rewrite ERP there. There are projects that they had to do that whole business by design fails, they canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP customers. They can't go to Workday. Workday can't even handle mid-market ERP. So we're at \u2013 so believe me, they want an alternatives to SAP, makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we've just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they're not putting their business than any risks. And that's why this one particular giant implementation they're watching closely. But by the way, they're not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of German, lots of them are working with \u2013 these are German customers the core of SAP are working with us. And taking some of their \u2013 moving some of their divisions already on some of their divisions to Oracle's Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They've gone that far. They don't want to continue with its obsolete code. This is \u2013 this opportunity is gigantic, because we have one European customer on \u2013 competitor on-premise. They don't have a cloud offering. That's SAP. And we've got one ERP Cloud competitor that just as not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground. It doesn't scale there a lot. There are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be \u2013 to get what used to be in the old world called gates share for ERP and getting \u2013 like Microsoft Office to be \u2013 the Microsoft Office of ERP, where \u2013 and it's sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP's largest customers. Yes, we can do this. We can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud. Okay, I'm happy to do that. I think the most interesting thing that's going on is, we've decided to take, if you will, in AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling our $30,000 deal to a $100,000 deal, because in a $30,000 deal, we can close in four weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they under \u2013 once they actually get their hands on Autonomous Database and they have working app, they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start some new land and expand. So we're selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach, again, is to \u2013 and most of it is not BYOL, because they're small. I mean some of it is. Not \u2013 yes, some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP. When we had ERP, people moving our e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. In the early days in Cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we're actually seeing new logos and database. But again, most of them are our customers, but they're not using their existing licenses. They're going ahead and using a standard cloud and license, what we call [indiscernible]. They pay us as we get. You pay for what you use. I mean, it's the promise of the cloud. And we're getting in thousands of these, because we think the best selling techniques for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch it backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There's nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That's what's going on. And again, it's working very, very well. I think it's working very, very well, because we're seeing just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month."

Ken?\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on short notice. Welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations' website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and thank you, all, for joining us on such very short notice. Of course September 11th is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us. We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the three of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team. Now, switching to the first quarter, I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly three quarters of total company revenues and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6% coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1. In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up nearly 40% including Fusion ERP, up mid-40s and Fusion HCM up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single-digits while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3% with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was US$0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in US$. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9% and GAAP EPS was US$0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in US$. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming, current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So, for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between US$0.87 and US$0.89. For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings, and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments, who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications, and then talk about autonomous database.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. As you're already aware, our back-office applications business has been reporting excellent growth for a number of quarters now. And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers, who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies, who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are but the biggest back-office player period. Cloud on-premises all of it. So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1. DP World, Shaw Communications, Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management, Envision Healthcare where we beat Workday and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system. Express Scripts who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud this is their first cloud application. Lyft who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was \u2013 started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward. Media newsroom another competitive win against Workday. National Oilwell Varco in a nice expansion both their EPM and supply chain management that we closed last year. So they're just \u2013 they're adding more products, they're adding \u2013 adding more of our overall Fusion suite. NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management. Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf. Standard Group Limited a large garment manufacturer where we beat that same Waldorf German Company. Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall Financials HCM everything. Continuing, we've got some great \u2013 some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K. an airport who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestle; Southwest Gas where we're displacing SAP and we beat Workday, as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud and they picked us. The University of Texas and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology, but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud. And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts including IDC are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey period. So you can see we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier period. The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database, because we think this is a game changer. All right game changer interesting term. It sounds like a clich\u00e9 a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously the first-generation cloud pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud. Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results. In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened, because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an Autonomous Database and we have one and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal. What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop, come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less, because we take the labor out, huge cost savings and there are no human beings involved and they can't make those common mistakes. All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 two years ago and really showed up in 2018 and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company. So here -- I got it. I'm sorry, am I missing? I'm curious \u2013 sorry, I got it. All right. So here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers for the autonomous database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the autonomous database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics. We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half 43% are just net new applications. We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention all it. We have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh yeah, and one more company moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber. And with that, let's turn it back to the operator.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Holly before we go to the Q&A, just a couple of clarifications, because I had a couple of e-mails on this. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%. And then for fiscal year 2020, we expect for the full year, this will be our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. With that, Holly, why don't we turn up to Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci Jefferies.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. I'm sure I speak for everyone just to briefly say that our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and his family at this time. But also knowing Mark for years, I'm sure he'd like us to sort of get back to business, so I'll move right to question here. So, there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter and you said it follows the strongest and yes really strong fourth quarter as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line, any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even it's still seasonal, but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality how Oracle used to be even more seasonal, or we're also hearing you guys you hear it too you hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all? I'm just curious any color would be helpful.\nSafra Catz: Sure. That's easy John. It was actually something very, very simple. First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit in fact internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the salesforce. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech salesforce between selling cloud -- a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses. So, the group selling new license was a new group and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only -- that's the only weakness we had and it was simply just a slow start as we reorged the North America tech sales force since we split it. So, there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference and so they just kind of outsized. But no we don't see anything and that's really all it was.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. That's really -- that's helpful Safra and that makes sense and sort of we're hearing things about that and just a quick follow-up maybe for Larry. Larry last quarter you had really strong results in the database options and most especially the ones related to the Autonomous Database. I'm just curious in this quarter, again, a seasonally softer first quarter, but can you talk about the options themselves? And I'm thinking more about things like -- my favorite is multi-tenancy, but there's others that are important too.\nLarry Ellison: I think multi-tenancy in memory all of the database options that are used with the Autonomous Database I think are selling very, very well. Again the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So, people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up and they move them to the cloud. So, some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So, our cloud salesforce in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again we signed more than 500 deals Autonomous Database deals in Q1. 3700 new trials the 500 signed paying customers more of them and we expect to double that in Q2. So, we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue, but also license revenue because of the options.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nJohn DiFucci: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. I'll start just by echoing John's sentiment and wish Mark a very speedy recovery. But getting on with business, I wanted to dig in a little bit to the great momentum that you're seeing in cloud ERP? And you gave a lot of color Larry in your comments, but perhaps if you can help us understand what the demand patterns look like amongst existing customers migrating versus new logo business that you're able to attract. And as well, that market has always been a fragmented market. And is there any evidence that you might be benefiting from consolidation finally in ERP which has so many players that's in the long tail? Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Well, I think -- let me talk about some of the easiest consolidations. We're picking on Lawson. We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So, we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about one-third of their customers of Lawson Healthcare customers are in our pipeline, either already converted or in our pipeline. So, we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean, it's a big deal. And NetSuite that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything. So we're taking a bunch of their customers. But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting. They don't have a true cloud system. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium large companies, go ahead and pick us and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that of course is the huge opportunity. We think we -- right now Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry; it's a very long answer. We have about half -- the two of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market as you say highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up. If you look at our market -- I mean I'm almost afraid to mention what our market share in ERP and the cloud is. What is it, 95%?\nSafra Catz: A lot.\nLarry Ellison: I mean, I don't know. I mean just, I'm guessing, but I don't know because I don't know of any other cloud ERP system other than NetSuite and Fusion, so maybe 95% is low. I mean, it sound a little crazy. But SAP really did not rewrite their code. They really don't have a cloud system. And we have an opportunity to go after them and just put that aside and then that whole other half of the ERP marketplace which is companies that a lot of people have never heard of. And yes, I think we can consolidate virtually all of that. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. It's a crazy opportunity. You don't see this happen very often.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, thanks for taking my question and I just wanted to echo Mark just wishing you the speediest recovery and all the best. And to the team, congrats on a solid start to the year. I just wanted to follow up on John's question on the database. One of the questions I get from investors is sort of the trajectory of database because obviously we're getting some metrics from you guys, that's showing an inflection in terms of customers, also just trials out there. How do you think about just I guess the shape of the curve of database growth going forward with all these different levers?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean, when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So, we're giving you, I would say a conservative point of view especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And \u2013 but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has, A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined our two biggest competitors. The cloud based \u2013 there are a bunch of open source cloud databases and there is a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them, or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves, while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean, they're \u2013 we're 100 times more reliable. I mean seriously a 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen, because you're \u2013 because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit \u2013 you can't make mistakes, because all that's \u2013 all of those decisions are automated. So, it's another \u2013 I mean, so we're sitting in two markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data \u2013 you can actually see the curve and the curve \u2013 and the curves \u2013 the curve we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that and you can see it. In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve we've got such little data in the curve. I understand \u2013 and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's I think going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those two markets, should be enough to make a living.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much. And again, I'm going to echo everyone's thoughts for Mark and thoughts with him and his family. Just wanted to ask two quick questions. One, if I could, Safra I know John DiFucci asked some questions about the environment. You talked about the North American sales reorg. I was wondering, just you've seen a lot of results since August, early August come in where maybe results haven't been as good as people wide. I'm just wondering if you're seeing \u2013 if you saw any elongation in the sales cycles, if there's anything you can share with us there just globally from what you've been seeing. And then secondly, just a question related to OCI and \u2013 I know obviously Open World's next week. There'll be a lot of partners to talk to. But a lot of the partners we've been speaking to of late have talked about a real pickup in momentum there. And just wondering, if you can share with us what you're seeing? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Sure. Actually, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum here at Oracle. The issue regarding markets either abroad, or in the United States we're not seeing it. The \u2013 we're on very, very positive momentum from a product cycle point of view. Our Fusion products are basically killing it. That's doing amazingly. Autonomous Database and the whole OCI is so compelling. And we are on the field, and we are expanding globally that we have just so much good news happening around the world that we're not seeing the weaknesses. And so to the extent that there are, we just have a lot of company, product, momentum, ourselves, I know that I will not be able to hold Larry back from answering your second question. So I'm just unleashing him in advance of Open World. Go ahead Larry.\nLarry Ellison: Okay. So next week at Open World, we're going to be talking about \u2013 we started with Autonomous Database in 2018. We continued to make improvements there and speeding it up. And \u2013 but we're not at Autonomous Database. At Open World, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean, it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean, you really should have an autonomous operating system. You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive. So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors. Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at Autonomous Database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics, our compute I can talk about all these other things, but we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends in Amazon or Google.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking question. Again, I echo everyone else. Please tell Mark that our thoughts are with him and his family. Larry, Safra given autonomous adoption commentary how good it's going, can you give us some more color based off this quarter on how the revenue lift is occurring as customers moving to the Autonomous Database based on what you're seeing in sales that is going now, how that's trending? And any sense to how to think about how large Autonomous Database revenue is, any color would be appreciated?\nLarry Ellison: Well, our approach, I mean, sometimes they're critical of Amazon. Sometimes I'm just -- I try to learn from what they do. I mean they were the innovator in cloud and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project, then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land start small, get in there on a project just demonstrates how great this technology is and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to two more moved on to -- then moved on to 10 more after that, so we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have four -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market.\nSafra Catz: It's brilliant. The reality is that most of our customers have been waiting for us. They've not brought those critical large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10 times the size and the opportunities often 1,000 times the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it and before you know it it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous, because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation. So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers. And it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered Systems, where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try one a quarter. And before you know it, they had dozens and they grew. Now this is the next level for those critical workloads that only can work in our cloud.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nOperator: And our last question for today is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, let me echo as well all our prayers are with Mark and his family. Just going back, I have two quick questions, one number question, which was on deferred Safra, in theory that should grow, can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that declined this quarter? But then the bigger question was more for me around ERP. Larry you talked about like you saw some medium-sized SAP customers starting to look. And is it -- kind of in terms of going bigger, is it kind of a question of functionality and capability or more around referenceability? Because if I look at your -- you just deleveraged full quarter's numbers. You closed the quarter in 11, 12 days and were able to deliver that, which is kind of a record I've seen. And you guys are using Oracle Fusion. So it's really power -- it seems like a very powerful solution. So I'm just wondering what's holding it back at this point. Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Well, first, I'd like to thank you for noticing the amazing close we did on Fusion Financials and we actually -- I got to tell you the team, I think is pretty happy with this result and realize that all of our customers should be easily doing the same thing. So, first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it. Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual next quarter you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here.\nLarry Ellison: Okay. The question about SAP, what are our big SAP customers waiting for before they make a decision to move to Oracle. It's been very interesting. We've -- I've spent a lot of time in Germany and talking to some customers and they want to move. I mean, I talked to several very large customers saying, we'd like to move to the cloud. We'd like to move to Fusion. Because I mean some of the -- I mean, moving to another SAP system -- and I mean some of these guys are facing bills of $1 billion to migrate -- for this SAP upgrade all of the consultants. So I mean, it's a big pill to swallow to do the upgrade HANA, what they call S/4HANA in the cloud except, it's not really a cloud.\nSafra Catz: And for no benefit.\nLarry Ellison: And for virtually, it's the same code you had before. It really is pretty much the same code you had before. So the customers really want to do it. What they're waiting for is one really large customer who's already done it. They are worried. They don't want to be first. No one wants -- none of these big -- these customers are conservative. They don't want to be first. We are in the middle of one of their largest customers converting them to Fusion. And as soon as we can talk about that publicly and use that as a reference, which will be probably will take another six months before we can do that, maybe less. But that's close, it's pretty close before they're live and several of their divisions are on Fusion. Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And if we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster then we can this one jumped in this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting. But as we get a few of these references, we think people -- customers want to use modern technology, they want to move to the cloud. And we can -- they can do that with Fusion and they cannot do it with SAP. So we think it's a huge opportunity for us, but we have to have a core of references before these big guys are going to move.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you. That's very clear.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call would be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today on short notice. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us for today's Oracle first quarter 2020 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and thank you, all, for joining us on such very short notice. Of course September 11th is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us. We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the three of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team. Now, switching to the first quarter, I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly three quarters of total company revenues and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6% coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1. In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up nearly 40% including Fusion ERP, up mid-40s and Fusion HCM up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single-digits while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3% with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was US$0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in US$. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9% and GAAP EPS was US$0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in US$. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming, current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So, for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between US$0.87 and US$0.89. For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings, and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments, who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications, and then talk about autonomous database. Sure. That's easy John. It was actually something very, very simple. First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit in fact internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the salesforce. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech salesforce between selling cloud -- a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses. So, the group selling new license was a new group and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only -- that's the only weakness we had and it was simply just a slow start as we reorged the North America tech sales force since we split it. So, there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference and so they just kind of outsized. But no we don't see anything and that's really all it was. A lot. Sure. Actually, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum here at Oracle. The issue regarding markets either abroad, or in the United States we're not seeing it. The \u2013 we're on very, very positive momentum from a product cycle point of view. Our Fusion products are basically killing it. That's doing amazingly. Autonomous Database and the whole OCI is so compelling. And we are on the field, and we are expanding globally that we have just so much good news happening around the world that we're not seeing the weaknesses. And so to the extent that there are, we just have a lot of company, product, momentum, ourselves, I know that I will not be able to hold Larry back from answering your second question. So I'm just unleashing him in advance of Open World. Go ahead Larry. It's brilliant. The reality is that most of our customers have been waiting for us. They've not brought those critical large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10 times the size and the opportunities often 1,000 times the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it and before you know it it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous, because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation. So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers. And it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered Systems, where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try one a quarter. And before you know it, they had dozens and they grew. Now this is the next level for those critical workloads that only can work in our cloud. Well, first, I'd like to thank you for noticing the amazing close we did on Fusion Financials and we actually -- I got to tell you the team, I think is pretty happy with this result and realize that all of our customers should be easily doing the same thing. So, first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it. Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual next quarter you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here. And for no benefit."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. As you're already aware, our back-office applications business has been reporting excellent growth for a number of quarters now. And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers, who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies, who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are but the biggest back-office player period. Cloud on-premises all of it. So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1. DP World, Shaw Communications, Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management, Envision Healthcare where we beat Workday and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system. Express Scripts who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud this is their first cloud application. Lyft who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was \u2013 started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward. Media newsroom another competitive win against Workday. National Oilwell Varco in a nice expansion both their EPM and supply chain management that we closed last year. So they're just \u2013 they're adding more products, they're adding \u2013 adding more of our overall Fusion suite. NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management. Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf. Standard Group Limited a large garment manufacturer where we beat that same Waldorf German Company. Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall Financials HCM everything. Continuing, we've got some great \u2013 some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K. an airport who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestle; Southwest Gas where we're displacing SAP and we beat Workday, as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud and they picked us. The University of Texas and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology, but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud. And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts including IDC are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey period. So you can see we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier period. The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database, because we think this is a game changer. All right game changer interesting term. It sounds like a cliche\u0301 a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously the first-generation cloud pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud. Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results. In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened, because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an Autonomous Database and we have one and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal. What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop, come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less, because we take the labor out, huge cost savings and there are no human beings involved and they can't make those common mistakes. All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 two years ago and really showed up in 2018 and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company. So here -- I got it. I'm sorry, am I missing? I'm curious \u2013 sorry, I got it. All right. So here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers for the autonomous database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the autonomous database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics. We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half 43% are just net new applications. We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention all it. We have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh yeah, and one more company moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber. And with that, let's turn it back to the operator. I think multi-tenancy in memory all of the database options that are used with the Autonomous Database I think are selling very, very well. Again the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So, people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up and they move them to the cloud. So, some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So, our cloud salesforce in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again we signed more than 500 deals Autonomous Database deals in Q1. 3700 new trials the 500 signed paying customers more of them and we expect to double that in Q2. So, we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue, but also license revenue because of the options. Well, I think -- let me talk about some of the easiest consolidations. We're picking on Lawson. We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So, we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about one-third of their customers of Lawson Healthcare customers are in our pipeline, either already converted or in our pipeline. So, we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean, it's a big deal. And NetSuite that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything. So we're taking a bunch of their customers. But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting. They don't have a true cloud system. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium large companies, go ahead and pick us and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that of course is the huge opportunity. We think we -- right now Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry; it's a very long answer. We have about half -- the two of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market as you say highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up. If you look at our market -- I mean I'm almost afraid to mention what our market share in ERP and the cloud is. What is it, 95%? I mean, I don't know. I mean just, I'm guessing, but I don't know because I don't know of any other cloud ERP system other than NetSuite and Fusion, so maybe 95% is low. I mean, it sound a little crazy. But SAP really did not rewrite their code. They really don't have a cloud system. And we have an opportunity to go after them and just put that aside and then that whole other half of the ERP marketplace which is companies that a lot of people have never heard of. And yes, I think we can consolidate virtually all of that. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. It's a crazy opportunity. You don't see this happen very often. Okay. Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean, when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So, we're giving you, I would say a conservative point of view especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And \u2013 but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has, A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined our two biggest competitors. The cloud based \u2013 there are a bunch of open source cloud databases and there is a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them, or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves, while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean, they're \u2013 we're 100 times more reliable. I mean seriously a 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen, because you're \u2013 because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit \u2013 you can't make mistakes, because all that's \u2013 all of those decisions are automated. So, it's another \u2013 I mean, so we're sitting in two markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data \u2013 you can actually see the curve and the curve \u2013 and the curves \u2013 the curve we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that and you can see it. In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve we've got such little data in the curve. I understand \u2013 and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's I think going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those two markets, should be enough to make a living. Okay. So next week at Open World, we're going to be talking about \u2013 we started with Autonomous Database in 2018. We continued to make improvements there and speeding it up. And \u2013 but we're not at Autonomous Database. At Open World, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean, it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean, you really should have an autonomous operating system. You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive. So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors. Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at Autonomous Database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics, our compute I can talk about all these other things, but we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends in Amazon or Google. Well, our approach, I mean, sometimes they're critical of Amazon. Sometimes I'm just -- I try to learn from what they do. I mean they were the innovator in cloud and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project, then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land start small, get in there on a project just demonstrates how great this technology is and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to two more moved on to -- then moved on to 10 more after that, so we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have four -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market. Okay. The question about SAP, what are our big SAP customers waiting for before they make a decision to move to Oracle. It's been very interesting. We've -- I've spent a lot of time in Germany and talking to some customers and they want to move. I mean, I talked to several very large customers saying, we'd like to move to the cloud. We'd like to move to Fusion. Because I mean some of the -- I mean, moving to another SAP system -- and I mean some of these guys are facing bills of $1 billion to migrate -- for this SAP upgrade all of the consultants. So I mean, it's a big pill to swallow to do the upgrade HANA, what they call S/4HANA in the cloud except, it's not really a cloud. And for virtually, it's the same code you had before. It really is pretty much the same code you had before. So the customers really want to do it. What they're waiting for is one really large customer who's already done it. They are worried. They don't want to be first. No one wants -- none of these big -- these customers are conservative. They don't want to be first. We are in the middle of one of their largest customers converting them to Fusion. And as soon as we can talk about that publicly and use that as a reference, which will be probably will take another six months before we can do that, maybe less. But that's close, it's pretty close before they're live and several of their divisions are on Fusion. Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And if we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster then we can this one jumped in this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting. But as we get a few of these references, we think people -- customers want to use modern technology, they want to move to the cloud. And we can -- they can do that with Fusion and they cannot do it with SAP. So we think it's a huge opportunity for us, but we have to have a core of references before these big guys are going to move."

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website as well. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and encouraging you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking the questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We are again reporting earnings earlier than last year. And with Fusion ERP, we are now filing our quarterly and annual financial statements faster than any other company in the S&P 500. This is possible because of the highly automated and machine learning-enabled system that helps us complete the accounting of financial transactions much more quickly. As you can see, we had a fantastic quarter with revenue nearly $200 million above my guidance. Q4 is really a story of every product, every region, and every metric exceeding expectations. The credit for the excellent full year results in the quarter goes to our global team of employees who supported our customers without interruption this past year. We were successful by continuing to deliver best-in-class products and services, both infrastructure and applications to help our customers in their digital transformation, many who\u2019ve reinvented themselves in real time because of the pandemic. Now, the growth rates we are reporting today are entirely organic, reflecting true [Technical Difficulty] related growth across our product portfolio. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.4 billion, up 8% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currency driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database, and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion and grew 32% in constant currency for the quarter, including Fusion ERP, which was up 42%. NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 30%. Our back-office cloud application revenue is not only bigger than our nearest competitor but also growing more than twice as fast. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2.3 billion. OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103% in constant currency; Autonomous Database, up 56%; and cloud customer revenues, up 50%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Customers are adopting OCI because of its unique focus on performance and security at the most competitive price. The highly differentiated Autonomous Database, which is available there and the flexibility of deploying Oracle Cloud, both in our own data center, what we call public cloud or behind our customers\u2019 firewall, Cloud@Customer. License revenues were $2.1 billion [ph], up 9% in USD, 5% in constant currency. So, all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.2 billion, up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% in constant currency this quarter, and we made significant investments in our cloud business. And while you can see some of the ROI in FY21\u2019s revenue growth, we expect the most of the return will be realized in FY\u201922 and beyond. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.4 billion, up 6% in USD; and the operating margin was 49%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% and below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items that hit in the quarter. EPS was $1.54, up 29% in USD and up 22% in constant currency. By the way, GAAP EPS was $1.37, up 39% in USD, 31% in constant currency. Now, for the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $28.7 billion, up 5% in USD, up 3% in constant currency. Total Company revenues for the year were $40.5 billion, up in 4%, USD, 2% in constant currency. FY\u201921 recurring cloud services and license support revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 71% of total company revenue, up from 70% last year, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow and accelerate. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $4.67, up 21% in USD, up 18% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. The full-year operating margin percentage was 47%, actually our best result in seven years and up 245 basis points from 44% last year. Operating cash flows over the last four quarters was a record $15.9 billion, up 21% in USD. Our free cash flow was also a record, $13.8 billion, up 19% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.1 billion during the year. For the quarter -- back to the quarter, operating cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 34% in USD; and free cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 30% from last year. As in the side, free cash flow would have been about 30 -- $300 million lower as some CapEx targeted for Q4 was actually spent in the last two weeks, so in early June. We now have more than $46 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion, up 10% in USD, 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance is $41.3 billion, up 8% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As you\u2019ve heard me say many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 107 million shares for a total of $8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 329 million shares for a total of $21 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 44%. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to the guidance. Let me first start with my confidence in the continuation of our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal-year 2022. As I\u2019ve said many times over the last two years, our overall revenue growth is continuing to accelerate as our fast-growing cloud business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue for fiscal 2022 growing faster than fiscal \u201821 with constant currency revenue growth somewhere in mid-single digits. Given our increasing confidence in revenue growth and our unique and differentiated position in the market, we are going to invest back in the business at a greater rate, so we can further accelerate the top line. We also see cloud as being fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as everyone knows, our annual non-GAAP margins of 47%, and that\u2019s what we run the business at, are in fact the highest non-GAAP margins of all of our competitors. And we believe that now is the right time to increase our investment to capture market share. As such, we expect to roughly double our cloud CapEx spend in FY 2022 to nearly $4 billion. We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1. I\u2019ll review this on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should be about 2% to 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on EPS in Q1, however, currency fluctuates and the actual impact could be different. Total revenues for Q1 are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in USD and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue growth for Q1 will be about the same as Q4 at 4% in constant currency and then climb through the year. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 2% and 6% and be between $0.94 and $0.98 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency is expected to be anywhere from negative to positive 2 and be between $0.91 and $0.95 in constant currency. Now, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. Finally, we want to thank our employees around the world for working so hard and staying focused on our customers and partners during the pandemic. And we also want to send particular thanks and warmest wishes to our employees in COVID hotspots who\u2019ve been hit particularly hard in [Technical Difficulty] and with whom we have been working very hard to support them, including providing vaccination. We just want to thank all of you and congratulate you all on a successful year and year-end. You\u2019ve all been remarkable. So, thank you. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thanks, Safra, and great job. Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings per share growth. Our strategy is as easy to explain as it is technically challenging to implement. That\u2019s a good thing. If it wasn\u2019t hard to do, others would be able to do it. Our strategy and applications depends on Oracle becoming the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud ERP systems. Then, building upon that strong ERP foundation, we\u2019re going to expand into manufacturing, CRM and industry-specific applications. We are successfully executing this strategy. Oracle Fusion and NetSuite are now the world\u2019s two most popular cloud ERP systems. SAP, the leader in on-premise ERP, never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. This has caused hundreds of customers to abandon SAP and migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP. That\u2019s already happened. But over the coming months, several more major banks and utilities and a lot of other companies will complete their Oracle Fusion implementation projects and go live on Fusion ERP. Oracle is taking massive amounts of share away from SAP ERP. It\u2019s crucial to our future. While our Fusion and NetSuite [Technical Difficulty] have long been growing, we have also developed a complete new generation of cloud application suites. Our new manufacturing systems fully support and manage automated robotic factories. No one else does that. Our new cloud CRM applications help you sell more by fully automated internet advertising, lead generation and qualification. Nobody else does that. And we\u2019re launching cloud application suites for 2 new industries, health care, and state and local government. Our health care initiative is an outgrowth of the national public health management systems that we built to manage the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and vaccine distribution in the United States and in other countries around the world. In summary, our cloud application portfolio is more complete than other apps vendors and better integrated because almost all of our applications were developed internally, not acquired. Our infrastructure strategy depends on AI technology, specifically, neural networks and machine learning that we use to develop second generation autonomous cloud services, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Autonomous Linux operating system and an array of autonomous cybersecurity defense bots that automatically identify and neutralize cyber attacks. All of Oracle\u2019s cloud applications then run within the defensive perimeter of Oracle\u2019s autonomous cloud infrastructure, the most reliable and secure platform in the world. And that\u2019s increasingly important in a world plagued by cyber warfare, data theft and ransomware. Oracle\u2019s Autonomous Database and other autonomous services eliminate human labor. No human labor means no human error or opportunity for human mischief. Autonomy makes computer systems and cars much safer and more reliable. The Oracle Autonomous Database offers 99.995% availability. That means only a few minutes of downtime a year. And we have zero downtime security patching and upgrades, available today for infrastructure and very soon available for all of our applications. Economics is also important. OCI has, by far, the best cost performance of any infrastructure hyperscaler. That\u2019s why so many service providers, like Zoom, have chosen to expand into OCI. OCI\u2019s cost performance is continuously getting better. Our new version of MySQL, the world\u2019s most popular open-source database, just got between 10 and 100 times faster. And when you charge by the minute, every minute you don\u2019t use is money saved. Our new ARM microprocessors from technology partner Ampere delivers much better compute cost performance than either Intel or AMD, and by far, the lowest energy usage of any server microprocessor in the world. So, our latest infrastructure technologies are Good for our applications, good for your budget, good for the health of the planet and very good for Oracle\u2019s future. Back to you, Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please now prepare the audience to poll for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. And congratulations on to the team on a clean, nice quarter. I\u2019d like to try to get some more color on the drivers of the success of the Oracle Cloud ERP solution. Can you give us some more sense of how much of Oracle Fusion ERP is from new Oracle ERP customers? How much is international versus the U.S.? How much is large enterprise? Where is the sweet spot? Any color you can give to get a sense of what\u2019s really driving the growth, and how much of that is new to versus existing customers would be very helpful.\nLarry Ellison: Yes. This is Larry. There are more new customers than upgrades from on-premise ERP with Oracle Fusion. So, it\u2019s probably about 60-40, in the 60s, it\u2019s probably not quite two to one new customers, but most of the -- a majority of the business is coming from new customers. We\u2019re also upgrading our installed base of the E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customers, [Technical Difficulty] customers, people like that. They are coming from our on-premise installed base. So, that\u2019s really the trend. And we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomenon is relatively recent in the last 12 months -- over the last two years, but it\u2019s really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So, we think that\u2019s going to hold. So, another way to look at it is it\u2019s a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses. Fusion ERP, I mean, it is certainly much bigger than $10 billion -- and NetSuite is bigger than $10 billion, Fusion is probably bigger than $20 billion as these businesses mature.\nSafra Catz: Yes, and as far as where it\u2019s happening, I have to tell you, it is so broad-based. It is a worldwide phenomenon for us. Our Fusion, NetSuite are just chugging along. It was an incredible, incredible Q4, and Q1 looks enormous. So imagine, bookings are way up, and there\u2019s just a lot of success. We have so many customers that have gone live. So, we have references from some of the largest companies in the world to really small or medium-sized companies that it\u2019s pretty consistent, almost any prospect can find many companies just like it already being incredibly successful. And I think that, frankly, the pandemic taught many of our prospects and customers that moving quickly is really required these days. I think that folks used to think moving quickly is risky. I think, they really saw that they had to move to much more modern, flexible, digital businesses, and that we are the [Technical Difficulty] destination for them for the back-office without a doubt.\nLarry Ellison: I\u2019d like to add one thing. We almost never lose a competitive ERP deal in the cloud, virtually never.\nOperator: And our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on another year of 20% -- or a year of 20% plus earnings growth. And frankly, nice to see the stock starting to reflect the durability of earnings growth you guys have seen over the past couple of years. So, it\u2019s nice to see that. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the infrastructure side of the equation, and in particular, OCI. Another quarter of, I think you said, 103% growth in OCI consumption. Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle Database workloads? We know there\u2019s a lot of those out there that just run so well on OCI, or is there a broader perspective of the big workloads that guys are bringing over, not looking for commentary on any specific customer, but just broadly what do you see in this space? Where do you guys do well? Where do you win with OCI?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. I mean, it\u2019s really easy to remember. About half of it\u2019s database, half of it\u2019s everything else. So, I mean everything else -- I mean, the database, you understand. They\u2019re lifting and shifting existing database workloads and developing new Oracle Database workloads on OCI. The other thing varies from things like Zoom who have moved over, but also in simulations, and we\u2019re very, very good at running simulation software. So, almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their PaaS simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. So, we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads running on -- running in OCI and the other half is a variety of new customers doing new applications, not database related.\nSafra Catz: Keith, thank you. First of all, thank you for [Technical Difficulty]. The reality is that any customer that is really focused on performance, security like Larry mentioned, and cost, which happens to show up in many, many workloads, one of the areas we\u2019re doing particularly well are ISVs who are obviously experts at running their workloads. They\u2019re in the business and they are coming to us extensively because they\u2019re really studying the benefits that we bring them. And of course, as I mentioned and as we never stop mentioning, security with what\u2019s going on these days. You really have to be in a cloud that is basically obsessed with security while still giving you incredible performance at lower cost. I mean, once we are given a try, what happens is the workload comes, one workload comes, and it\u2019s usually followed by many others. And so, it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum, let\u2019s say.\nLarry Ellison: And I want to emphasize one thing, I said it, but I want to say it again, is there are new Oracle workloads being developed, especially in the area of genomics where there have been a number of new databases moved to Oracle and OCI that track things like the genetic variants of COVID-19. But, there are a number of these things, and you\u2019ll see a whole series of announcements coming out where we\u2019ve moved aggressively into health care, and one of the big new applications for our database is just -- is tracking the genomics of pathogens, and those databases are being developed right on Oracle Autonomous Database from scratch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats as well on a strong quarter. I\u2019ve got one for Safra and one for Larry. Safra, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about the potential revenue opportunity for the app space, if you were to migrate everybody to SaaS. So, I wanted to ask about the database side and in particular, Exadata. Can you give us a sense of what the revenue potential or uplift could be if you shifted all Exadata customers to Cloud@Customer? And how you feel about the strength of those motions heading into the new fiscal year? And then, for Larry, I mean, as you guys push to drive adoption of Autonomous Database, should we think of Cloud@Customer being the biggest vehicle for adoption, or what routes to market do you see working best?\nSafra Catz: Okay. Let me get it started, and then Larry can finish. So, Derrick, I\u2019m glad you asked because when customers move from running their own dozen or 100 Exadatas, when it\u2019s time for a refresh or a new set, we prefer that they go to Cloud@Customer and -- or have a dedicated region. However, just so that you know since you all focus on the numbers, you have to understand that when we sell hardware, regular way, we recognize all that revenue once it\u2019s delivered, all that hardware is delivered. But, when we install Cloud@Customer, Exadata Cloud@Customer or dedicated region, we don\u2019t recognize that revenue upfront. And so, -- and you don\u2019t even see that that is all happening right now in our income statement and yet we\u2019re still growing. So, as a general matter, first of all, it is much -- even though we believe we make around 3 times, maybe more, in revenue in the case of Cloud@Customer versus selling -- just selling the hardware can be anywhere from 3 to 5 times, the customer actually ends up spending less because we manage their entire estate. We update their databases, et cetera, depending on what services they\u2019re using, and they get the benefit of always having capacity, always having the most up-to-date system, the most secure system and patched and fully managed by us. So, though, ultimately, they give us significantly more money 3 to 5 times as much, in fact, they end up spending much less to maintain that estate. So, for -- it\u2019s kind of a win-win because we\u2019re much more efficient, fully automated and save them the immense amount of labor it takes to run these very critical production systems. Okay. I guess, Larry\u2019s question, what was it again, Derrick?\nDerrick Wood: It was around Autonomous Database and what\u2019s kind of the route to market to drive adoption, is Cloud@Customer really the biggest vehicle, or are there other routes that are working well too?\nLarry Ellison: Well, the Autonomous Database only runs in the cloud. It does not run on-premise. It doesn\u2019t run on -- even at the Exadata appliance. It runs on [Technical Difficulty] or public cloud. So right now, the public cloud is the most popular route for Autonomous Database and Cloud@Customer is becoming more popular as people scale up, so. But right now, the most popular way to use Autonomous Database is in the OCI public cloud.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. And thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, Safra, could you just talk about sort of the performance in Europe this quarter? It looks like it bounced back nicely. And I guess, along those same lines, can you just talk about cloud adoption on certain [Technical Difficulty] just maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the -- I assume you guys are probably leading the charge. But what you\u2019re seeing in other regions just following maybe close behind it? Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Sure. So, first of all, I have two new leaders in Europe, Middle East, Africa. I have a very refreshed and new and really successful management team in Europe. And they are pretty much firing on all cylinders. It is extremely broad throughout Europe, Middle East, all of EMEA. [Technical Difficulty] tell you incredible strength worldwide. Latin America doing phenomenally; Japan doing phenomenally; as a result, JPAC doing very, very well; and of course, led by North America. I have to tell you, it\u2019s been an amazing year. It was a phenomenal quarter, but truly an amazing year worldwide. And I\u2019m more than satisfied. I am delighted by the results of the team. And for me, this was my first full year with the field. So, I really applaud the team for doing a spectacular job worldwide.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Safra, the one thing that was interesting that we didn\u2019t really talk that much about is your RPO and RPO growth. Can you talk about it again? Because like the growth there is actually even better than I see on the revenue line. And that, to me, suggests that this wasn\u2019t just Q4. It looks like things are coming together broad-based in the coming quarters as well. Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Yes, Raimo, you are so right. Q4, but really, it\u2019s just coming together all around, the RPO. I\u2019m glad [Technical Difficulty] really, really strong bookings are -- were truly enormous. Obviously, they don\u2019t show up in the income statement right away, but they -- the future is just so positive. And you might have heard me, I was hinting to that in my comments. And one of the reasons we\u2019re so comfortable leaning into our investment because we really want to make sure we\u2019ve got the capacity to take on the enormous amount of bookings that are flying in and that both were [Technical Difficulty] during the year and are going on line, and so, will be recognized over this next year and beyond. But, there is just an enormous backlog for us of customers that are going live and that will start consuming and we\u2019re very optimistic. So, thank you so much for asking, and I\u2019m glad you noticed that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Okay. Congrats.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Safra. If there are any questions coming out of this call, please feel free to call the Investor Relations hotline. Otherwise, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Erica for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

The highly differentiated Autonomous Database, which is available there and the flexibility of deploying Oracle Cloud, both in our own data center, what we call public cloud or behind our customers' firewall, Cloud@Customer. License revenues were $2.1 billion [ph], up 9% in USD, 5% in constant currency. So, all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.2 billion, up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% in constant currency this quarter, and we made significant investments in our cloud business. And while you can see some of the ROI in FY21's revenue growth, we expect the most of the return will be realized in FY'22 and beyond. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.4 billion, up 6% in USD; and the operating margin was 49%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% and below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items that hit in the quarter. EPS was $1.54, up 29% in USD and up 22% in constant currency. By the way, GAAP EPS was $1.37, up 39% in USD, 31% in constant currency. Now, for the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $28.7 billion, up 5% in USD, up 3% in constant currency. Total Company revenues for the year were $40.5 billion, up in 4%, USD, 2% in constant currency. FY'21 recurring cloud services and license support revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 71% of total company revenue, up from 70% last year, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow and accelerate. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $4.67, up 21% in USD, up 18% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. The full-year operating margin percentage was 47%, actually our best result in seven years and up 245 basis points from 44% last year. Operating cash flows over the last four quarters was a record $15.9 billion, up 21% in USD. Our free cash flow was also a record, $13.8 billion, up 19% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.1 billion during the year. For the quarter -- back to the quarter, operating cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 34% in USD; and free cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 30% from last year. As in the side, free cash flow would have been about 30 -- $300 million lower as some CapEx targeted for Q4 was actually spent in the last two weeks, so in early June. We now have more than $46 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion, up 10% in USD, 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance is $41.3 billion, up 8% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As you've heard me say many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 107 million shares for a total of $8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 329 million shares for a total of $21 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 44%. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to the guidance. Let me first start with my confidence in the continuation of our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal-year 2022. As I've said many times over the last two years, our overall revenue growth is continuing to accelerate as our fast-growing cloud business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue for fiscal 2022 growing faster than fiscal \u201821 with constant currency revenue growth somewhere in mid-single digits. Given our increasing confidence in revenue growth and our unique and differentiated position in the market, we are going to invest back in the business at a greater rate, so we can further accelerate the top line. We also see cloud as being fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as everyone knows, our annual non-GAAP margins of 47%, and that's what we run the business at, are in fact the highest non-GAAP margins of all of our competitors. And we believe that now is the right time to increase our investment to capture market share. As such, we expect to roughly double our cloud CapEx spend in FY 2022 to nearly $4 billion. We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1. I'll review this on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should be about 2% to 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on EPS in Q1, however, currency fluctuates and the actual impact could be different. Total revenues for Q1 are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in USD and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue growth for Q1 will be about the same as Q4 at 4% in constant currency and then climb through the year. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 2% and 6% and be between $0.94 and $0.98 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency is expected to be anywhere from negative to positive 2 and be between $0.91 and $0.95 in constant currency. Now, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. Finally, we want to thank our employees around the world for working so hard and staying focused on our customers and partners during the pandemic. And we also want to send particular thanks and warmest wishes to our employees in COVID hotspots who've been hit particularly hard in [Technical Difficulty] and with whom we have been working very hard to support them, including providing vaccination. We just want to thank all of you and congratulate you all on a successful year and year-end. You've all been remarkable. So, thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Yes, and as far as where it's happening, I have to tell you, it is so broad-based. It is a worldwide phenomenon for us. Our Fusion, NetSuite are just chugging along. It was an incredible, incredible Q4, and Q1 looks enormous. So imagine, bookings are way up, and there's just a lot of success. We have so many customers that have gone live. So, we have references from some of the largest companies in the world to really small or medium-sized companies that it's pretty consistent, almost any prospect can find many companies just like it already being incredibly successful. And I think that, frankly, the pandemic taught many of our prospects and customers that moving quickly is really required these days. I think that folks used to think moving quickly is risky. I think, they really saw that they had to move to much more modern, flexible, digital businesses, and that we are the [Technical Difficulty] destination for them for the back-office without a doubt. Keith, thank you. First of all, thank you for [Technical Difficulty]. The reality is that any customer that is really focused on performance, security like Larry mentioned, and cost, which happens to show up in many, many workloads, one of the areas we're doing particularly well are ISVs who are obviously experts at running their workloads. They're in the business and they are coming to us extensively because they're really studying the benefits that we bring them. And of course, as I mentioned and as we never stop mentioning, security with what's going on these days. You really have to be in a cloud that is basically obsessed with security while still giving you incredible performance at lower cost. I mean, once we are given a try, what happens is the workload comes, one workload comes, and it's usually followed by many others. And so, it's -- we've got a lot of momentum, let's say. Okay. Let me get it started, and then Larry can finish. So, Derrick, I'm glad you asked because when customers move from running their own dozen or 100 Exadatas, when it's time for a refresh or a new set, we prefer that they go to Cloud@Customer and -- or have a dedicated region. However, just so that you know since you all focus on the numbers, you have to understand that when we sell hardware, regular way, we recognize all that revenue once it's delivered, all that hardware is delivered. But, when we install Cloud@Customer, Exadata Cloud@Customer or dedicated region, we don't recognize that revenue upfront. And so, -- and you don't even see that that is all happening right now in our income statement and yet we're still growing. So, as a general matter, first of all, it is much -- even though we believe we make around 3 times, maybe more, in revenue in the case of Cloud@Customer versus selling -- just selling the hardware can be anywhere from 3 to 5 times, the customer actually ends up spending less because we manage their entire estate. We update their databases, et cetera, depending on what services they're using, and they get the benefit of always having capacity, always having the most up-to-date system, the most secure system and patched and fully managed by us. So, though, ultimately, they give us significantly more money 3 to 5 times as much, in fact, they end up spending much less to maintain that estate. So, for -- it's kind of a win-win because we're much more efficient, fully automated and save them the immense amount of labor it takes to run these very critical production systems. Okay. I guess, Larry's question, what was it again, Derrick? Sure. So, first of all, I have two new leaders in Europe, Middle East, Africa. I have a very refreshed and new and really successful management team in Europe. And they are pretty much firing on all cylinders. It is extremely broad throughout Europe, Middle East, all of EMEA. [Technical Difficulty] tell you incredible strength worldwide. Latin America doing phenomenally; Japan doing phenomenally; as a result, JPAC doing very, very well; and of course, led by North America. I have to tell you, it's been an amazing year. It was a phenomenal quarter, but truly an amazing year worldwide. And I'm more than satisfied. I am delighted by the results of the team. And for me, this was my first full year with the field. So, I really applaud the team for doing a spectacular job worldwide. Yes, Raimo, you are so right. Q4, but really, it's just coming together all around, the RPO. I'm glad [Technical Difficulty] really, really strong bookings are -- were truly enormous. Obviously, they don't show up in the income statement right away, but they -- the future is just so positive. And you might have heard me, I was hinting to that in my comments. And one of the reasons we're so comfortable leaning into our investment because we really want to make sure we've got the capacity to take on the enormous amount of bookings that are flying in and that both were [Technical Difficulty] during the year and are going on line, and so, will be recognized over this next year and beyond. But, there is just an enormous backlog for us of customers that are going live and that will start consuming and we're very optimistic. So, thank you so much for asking, and I'm glad you noticed that."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thanks, Safra, and great job. Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings per share growth. Our strategy is as easy to explain as it is technically challenging to implement. That's a good thing. If it wasn't hard to do, others would be able to do it. Our strategy and applications depends on Oracle becoming the world's largest provider of cloud ERP systems. Then, building upon that strong ERP foundation, we're going to expand into manufacturing, CRM and industry-specific applications. We are successfully executing this strategy. Oracle Fusion and NetSuite are now the world's two most popular cloud ERP systems. SAP, the leader in on-premise ERP, never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. This has caused hundreds of customers to abandon SAP and migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP. That's already happened. But over the coming months, several more major banks and utilities and a lot of other companies will complete their Oracle Fusion implementation projects and go live on Fusion ERP. Oracle is taking massive amounts of share away from SAP ERP. It's crucial to our future. While our Fusion and NetSuite [Technical Difficulty] have long been growing, we have also developed a complete new generation of cloud application suites. Our new manufacturing systems fully support and manage automated robotic factories. No one else does that. Our new cloud CRM applications help you sell more by fully automated internet advertising, lead generation and qualification. Nobody else does that. And we're launching cloud application suites for 2 new industries, health care, and state and local government. Our health care initiative is an outgrowth of the national public health management systems that we built to manage the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and vaccine distribution in the United States and in other countries around the world. In summary, our cloud application portfolio is more complete than other apps vendors and better integrated because almost all of our applications were developed internally, not acquired. Our infrastructure strategy depends on AI technology, specifically, neural networks and machine learning that we use to develop second generation autonomous cloud services, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Autonomous Linux operating system and an array of autonomous cybersecurity defense bots that automatically identify and neutralize cyber attacks. All of Oracle's cloud applications then run within the defensive perimeter of Oracle's autonomous cloud infrastructure, the most reliable and secure platform in the world. And that's increasingly important in a world plagued by cyber warfare, data theft and ransomware. Oracle's Autonomous Database and other autonomous services eliminate human labor. No human labor means no human error or opportunity for human mischief. Autonomy makes computer systems and cars much safer and more reliable. The Oracle Autonomous Database offers 99.995% availability. That means only a few minutes of downtime a year. And we have zero downtime security patching and upgrades, available today for infrastructure and very soon available for all of our applications. Economics is also important. OCI has, by far, the best cost performance of any infrastructure hyperscaler. That's why so many service providers, like Zoom, have chosen to expand into OCI. OCI's cost performance is continuously getting better. Our new version of MySQL, the world's most popular open-source database, just got between 10 and 100 times faster. And when you charge by the minute, every minute you don't use is money saved. Our new ARM microprocessors from technology partner Ampere delivers much better compute cost performance than either Intel or AMD, and by far, the lowest energy usage of any server microprocessor in the world. So, our latest infrastructure technologies are Good for our applications, good for your budget, good for the health of the planet and very good for Oracle's future. Back to you, Safra. Yes. This is Larry. There are more new customers than upgrades from on-premise ERP with Oracle Fusion. So, it's probably about 60-40, in the 60s, it's probably not quite two to one new customers, but most of the -- a majority of the business is coming from new customers. We're also upgrading our installed base of the E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customers, [Technical Difficulty] customers, people like that. They are coming from our on-premise installed base. So, that's really the trend. And we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomenon is relatively recent in the last 12 months -- over the last two years, but it's really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So, we think that's going to hold. So, another way to look at it is it's a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses. Fusion ERP, I mean, it is certainly much bigger than $10 billion -- and NetSuite is bigger than $10 billion, Fusion is probably bigger than $20 billion as these businesses mature. I'd like to add one thing. We almost never lose a competitive ERP deal in the cloud, virtually never. Okay. I mean, it's really easy to remember. About half of it's database, half of it's everything else. So, I mean everything else -- I mean, the database, you understand. They're lifting and shifting existing database workloads and developing new Oracle Database workloads on OCI. The other thing varies from things like Zoom who have moved over, but also in simulations, and we're very, very good at running simulation software. So, almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their PaaS simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. So, we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads running on -- running in OCI and the other half is a variety of new customers doing new applications, not database related. And I want to emphasize one thing, I said it, but I want to say it again, is there are new Oracle workloads being developed, especially in the area of genomics where there have been a number of new databases moved to Oracle and OCI that track things like the genetic variants of COVID-19. But, there are a number of these things, and you'll see a whole series of announcements coming out where we've moved aggressively into health care, and one of the big new applications for our database is just -- is tracking the genomics of pathogens, and those databases are being developed right on Oracle Autonomous Database from scratch. Well, the Autonomous Database only runs in the cloud. It does not run on-premise. It doesn't run on -- even at the Exadata appliance. It runs on [Technical Difficulty] or public cloud. So right now, the public cloud is the most popular route for Autonomous Database and Cloud@Customer is becoming more popular as people scale up, so. But right now, the most popular way to use Autonomous Database is in the OCI public cloud."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call.  A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of customers mentioned on this customer conference call as well as many others which have purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will also be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements.

We'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and then I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra?\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken. And good afternoon, everyone. We are again, reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance while EPS beat the mid-point of guidance by $0.05. Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue, as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 27%, NetSuite ERP up 22% and Fusion HCM up 21%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%; autonomous database was up 55%; cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200%, but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency. Operating expenses were down this quarter. And non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year, and our best Q3 results in more than 10 years. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7% slightly below our base tax rate, as a result of some discrete items. EPS was a $1.16 in U.S. dollars up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was a $1.68 in U.S. dollars, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a one-time net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter operating cash flow was $3.7 billion up 23% and free cash flow was $3.3 billion up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable security. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of 4 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividends, 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers, including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY2022. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double digit earnings growth, once again, in FY2022 for the fifth year in a row. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impacts could be different [so here it goes] [ph]. Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support will grow faster than in Q3, as well as strategic back-office cloud applications. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between a $1.28 and a $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between a $1.20 and a $1.24 in constant currency. CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars\u2019 website in which he quotes SAP, CFO, Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference. And I quote, \u201cI have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle.\u201d In other words, after personally, checking SAP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer move into Oracle Fusion on ERP, not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully. In Q3 alone we signed contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers, to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list of over a 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, or currently in the process of doing so. I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into two distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the fusion ERP suite, including core financials, it's Oracle wall-to-wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications, but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They have begun the migration, but they are not committed to doing the entire suite as yet, or they are not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet. Okay. So let me go to start the list. TPS Company, an industrial manufacturer of rail cars in North America replaced out all of the SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything with the fusion cloud, complete replacement of SAP ERP to fusion ERP. G4S plc security services firm, the world's largest security company by revenue, complete replacement of SAP R/3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. First Solar, North America\u2019s only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States replaced SAP's S4/HANA, Ariba, Concur third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion, HCM, and supply chain management. Transit Wireless, a North American telco completely replaced out SAP R/3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM. West Sussex County Council, a complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP now, HCM, EPM is Oracle Enterprise Performance Management, complete wall-to-wall Oracle at West Sussex County Council, no more SAP. CEMEX, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer, private labels bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain, transportation management, et cetera. New Zealand Inland Revenue, complete SAP R/3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. University of The Andes in Latin America, the number one university in Colombia, a complete replacement of \u2013 they had SAP for 10 years, replaced it with Oracle ERP, HCM, EPM, supply chain, sales, everything. Bip&Drive, a travel and transportation company in EMEA, electronic toll payment provider for the roadways in Spain, again, replaced \u2013 was offered a free S/4HANA upgrade, instead chose Oracle Fusion Cloud. GE Grid Software, an industrial manufacturer software for utilities and power transmissions, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP Fusion Cloud. Postcon, let\u2019s say the second largest mail carrier in Germany, SAP complete replacement of RP, replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management. Birmingham City Council, complete SAP replacement using Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM. They are the biggest city council in the UK. Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation, a toll road developer in Asia. SAP replacement got rid of SAP and replaced with Oracle ERP and Oracle EPM. Africa World Airlines replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. Batelco, that\u2019s the Bahrain telephone company, they had been running SAP for a decade and they moved to Fusion Cloud, ERP, EPM and HCM. European Logistics and Applied Engineering group, actually the name \u2013 they don\u2019t want their name specifically mentioned. They are the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3 and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA and the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP.  TICO Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America had SAP \u2013 had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP at the end of the sales. FedEx, FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They replaced out all of the \u2013 they are in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions and Oracle in other divisions. They\u2019re replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Western Digital, a complete replacement, they had SAP. Western Digital had SAP and SanDisk. They had SAP at HGST, replaced all of that out and have standardized an Oracle Fusion in the \u2013 Fusion ERP in the cloud. VP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR, R/3. They eliminated all of that. By the way in EMEA marine terminal operator, they are located in EMEA. They are global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized an Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud. Cohu, they are a semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP replaced out all of the SAP ERP and are standardized on Oracle. This one is interesting. They don\u2019t want their name mentioned. They are a huge European \u2013 North American and European manufacturer of ATMs and they\u2019ve replaced out all of SAP and the German subsidiary BOSSY throughout the world and they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM and they have added Oracle Performance Management, Fusion Performance Management. Let\u2019s see. Another company whose name they don\u2019t want to be mentioned, let\u2019s see, they are a high-tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R/3, ERP, HCM and standardized an Oracle Fusion, Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Albelli Group, they are a manufacturer of photo products in the UK. They replaced an SAP with, guess what Fusion ERP. Consol Energy, utilities company in Pittsburgh replaced out SAP with Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Enbridge, Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada, replaced out all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP. Gemini Industries \u2013 Gemini Energy, they are an LAV, they are an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil with substations all across Brazil, replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. GoodStorage in Latin America, the self-storage company in Brazil, again, got rid of SAP, put Infusion ERP. Grupo Globo, they are on media and entertainment, Latin America\u2019s largest media and entertainment company, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM. IQVIA, a complete SAP replacement. They are manufacturing pharmaceutical company in North America. They\u2019ve moved away from SAP standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. Corrigan, a healthcare company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion. NatWest Group, NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They\u2019re replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Wind Tre, Wind Tre is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy, again completely replacing out SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP, SCM and EPM. Okay. Now I want to go onto the second group \u2013 second group of companies and these are companies that had started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet \u2013 they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they\u2019re buying our supply chain. They\u2019re buying our procurement, They\u2019re buying our transportation management. They\u2019re buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials. So I want to be very specific that they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products. GN Airlines, Apollo Tyres, Achema, an adhesive solutions company in the UK, Aarhus Kommune, their municipality in Central Denmark, Caesars Enterprise Services, they have an idea \u2013 they bought Procurement in Supply Chain, a big hospitality company obviously in North America. Sheppard Danaher a product lifecycle management, they are a healthcare company. Department of Education and Training in Australia, they bought procurement.  DHL with an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running on SAP, but the new implementations they\u2019re going in are in other countries, not in Germany as yet, in other countries are, Oracle Fusion ERP. Dove bought supply chain management and transportation management. Temsa [ph] bought \u2013 replaced all of SAP and some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse management, supply chain planning, ERP. Again in some \u2013 and some subsidiaries all of ERP including an accounting procurement, all of that. Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan. Again the parent is running SAP financials but subs all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Keurig Dr Pepper, again \u2013 bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of \u2013 financial services company in North America, bought all of ERP. Honda bought supply [indiscernible] SAP Financials just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion transportation management and has moved into the \u2013 from on-premise to the cloud. InvoTech, again a North American company \u2013 again, but parent still running SAP financials but the subs are running Oracle Fusion. Jackson Life, Lakshmi Cement, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I am going to read this faster now, Juniper Networks, Lloyds Bank, Move Incorporated, Munich Re, the largest food company in the world, bought \u2013 just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing, Orlando International, PG&E, Porcelanosa, Republic Services, SAC Wireless and Nokia Company, Samsonite, Puma, Santander Bank, Therma-Tru Doors. Okay. I am going to stop right there or I\u2019ll take up all of the time you won\u2019t be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don\u2019t want to do that. Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than 100-plus companies. I did read over 100 companies as I\u2019m sure you painfully aware of. List is actually longer than the 100 companies I have just read. Some are most important wins and are very largest companies in regulated industries such as banking and utilities who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don\u2019t \u2013 even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don\u2019t want to be on \u2013 their name on this call, because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they \u2013 even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP. All right. So I\u2019d like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically trying to answer one key question. How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before. A major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don\u2019t take my word for it. Read the report, it\u2019s very short and it\u2019s to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front, I mean far \u2013 you can find a magic quadrant where there is more a bigger gap between number one and number two. And so, Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems. But what\u2019s surprising is SAP isn\u2019t number two. SAP is at number three. SAP is listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the lagger. Gartner \u2013 if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, SAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors. I want to read that again. \u201cSAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors.\u201d SAP, the once-dominant on-premise ERP market leader is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that has happened because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It\u2019s that same with 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud and it\u2019s too late for them to start now. I'll turn it back over to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please pull the audience for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital.\nMichael Turits: Larry, thanks for all the color on ERP. I'd like to switch over to your database. You've made meaningful improvements in both cloud customer and OCI too which both one of the two are required for ADB. So, are those improvements enough that we're now starting to see the upgrades to ADB? And are you able to monetize those upgrades to the point where we'll start to see database growth acceleration?\nLarry Ellison: The answer is I think there's no question. You're going to see a lot of database growth \u2013 a lot of database acceleration starting next year which we're a quarter away from. But we'll be fine in Q4. Again, its autonomous databases is growing pretty rapidly. But we expect it really to explode next year. And I really do mean very, very rapid growth next year. I'm not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it's going to suddenly spike but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Hi Larry. This SAP replacement wave, feels like kind of a historic moment because that kind of activity it's usually so rare and these are the logos are pretty large that you're mentioning. So when we see\u2026\nLarry Ellison: I acknowledge for interrupting. The really spectacular logos [indiscernible] there's some of them are pretty spectacular on there. But we have some that are much larger and much \u2013 and absolutely shocking. I've been alluding to these, but sometimes we're in the middle of an 18-month implementation. And the customer doesn't want any mention. If I could mention them all, it would be \u2013 it\u2019s front page news. I mean it's a very big deal. Yes. I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is \u2013 I think a long time ago, I said there are two technologies that will drive Oracle's future, one is the autonomous database and the other is ERP. We are \u2013 reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number more than half of SAP's customers we\u2019ll get. But keeping our own, yes, plus getting a lot of it from the smaller companies like M4 and Lawson.\nMark Murphy: So Larry, the ones that we see, which aren't too savvy, you mentioned DHL and Honda and Lloyds Bank. Is that a precursor to moving to Oracle core financials eventually. And I'm just wondering which of Oracle strength is really catalyzing that wave of replacements?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. So there are two lists. One, the first half of the list that I read and they're about equal sized lists where people that are already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list where people that had partially moved to Oracle, but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out. If we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that, but they still run SAP financials we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy. But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAPs on premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that it started the journey, we'll finish the journey. And they'll want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud, in procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect company \u2013 we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement, they buy supply chain and they see, okay, I like that. And I'm going to buy financials. So yes, we expect all of those or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything. \nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. Thank you very much for taking my question and appreciate the additional color that Safra you gave on the call. I'd like to turn to OCI Gen2. We've been hearing about security concerns from consumer internet companies. To what extent has OCI security technology helped you in business with these companies and is consumer internet a big driver for OCI Gen2, also to be clear, this is not about TikTok, it's that all the other consumer internet company opportunities. Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Yes. Well I think there are two things that are interesting about OCI. One on the security front. One is we believe security should be always be turned on and in other words, there is no light switch, security on, security off. We have these things called max security zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off and max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this, where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link \u2013 a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on. The second thing is autonomy is very interesting, because the Oracle autonomous database, by the way, the Oracle autonomous database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have autonomous Linux that is the foundation of OCS, the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle autonomous, Linux, Oracle autonomous database has no human labor associated with them. Okay. So everyone says, well, that's a huge cost saving. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit if there is no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there's no human mission, there's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data. So, we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI, other than its high performance, low cost, all of that, everyone likes to pay less and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers.\nMark Moerdler: I appreciate it. Thank you for the additional color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. I just wanted to focus in on the license line it was up 4% as reported to be a flat constant currency off of what was actually the toughest comp for this fiscal year. Wondering if you can provide some context of sort of what is driving that particularly sort of relative to the strength that you are also seeing in the cloud side? Is this the Oracle database, is this the add-ons to the Oracle database? Any sort of more color there. And then also in particular in sort of in conjunction with the cloud, that'd be great.\nSafra Catz: So let me take that. So the Oracle database remains very strong and what's good about the Oracle database is you can also bring your own license to the cloud. So it's both on-premise and in the cloud can be used there. And it remains very, very strong. The installed base of the Oracle database continues to grow. And that is of course our central piece. Now, in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications still require on-premise license for the customers\u2019 use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals, but especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in those areas. So database tops, doing incredibly well, Java doing very, very well and our vertical applications. And then pretty much everything else of course as you know is offered just in the cloud.\nPhil Winslow: Perfect. Thank you very much for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats as well on a great quarter. Larry, it's so great to hear every single one of those SAP wins, especially since investors think of SAP's customer relationships as being so deep. So clearly by displacing them in so many accounts, it speaks volumes to the quality of your product and trust that these companies place with Oracle. So, my question is this, why now, and why from a product perspective, you mentioned Gartner's take, but since Oracle has always competed on having better products, what have you been doing product wise that's enabled you to pull ahead of them like this and what do you need to continue to do product wise to remain ahead?\nLarry Ellison: So well we started 10 years ago to build fusion financials for the cloud to rewrite all \u2013 PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP, and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite, we had these three separate on-premise ERP systems, and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that with the cloud. And SAP unbelievably, they just, I mean \u2013 and we did a very good job. We started a decade ago and we did, I think, a very good job redoing a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud. That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur, they bought Ariba, they bought SuccessFactors, but they never \u2013 and we made some acquisitions also by the way, [indiscernible] and others right now at other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead, embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean, it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database and the, the thing we're competing with at so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, is what the SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP, this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java. And it's been entirely rewritten overload over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old. The same that they've always had, that they now will host for you. So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud, SAP just entirely missed the boat.  So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened. And their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You are on the cloud, you get new features and functions, you are on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is okay, you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Larry.\nLarry Ellison: It\u2019s amazing.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for the next 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I will turn the call back to Erica for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle's third quarter of 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken. And good afternoon, everyone. We are again, reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance while EPS beat the mid-point of guidance by $0.05. Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue, as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 27%, NetSuite ERP up 22% and Fusion HCM up 21%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%; autonomous database was up 55%; cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200%, but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency. Operating expenses were down this quarter. And non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year, and our best Q3 results in more than 10 years. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7% slightly below our base tax rate, as a result of some discrete items. EPS was a $1.16 in U.S. dollars up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was a $1.68 in U.S. dollars, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a one-time net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter operating cash flow was $3.7 billion up 23% and free cash flow was $3.3 billion up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable security. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of 4 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividends, 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers, including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY2022. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double digit earnings growth, once again, in FY2022 for the fifth year in a row. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impacts could be different [so here it goes] [ph]. Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support will grow faster than in Q3, as well as strategic back-office cloud applications. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between a $1.28 and a $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between a $1.20 and a $1.24 in constant currency. CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. So let me take that. So the Oracle database remains very strong and what's good about the Oracle database is you can also bring your own license to the cloud. So it's both on-premise and in the cloud can be used there. And it remains very, very strong. The installed base of the Oracle database continues to grow. And that is of course our central piece. Now, in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications still require on-premise license for the customers' use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals, but especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in those areas. So database tops, doing incredibly well, Java doing very, very well and our vertical applications. And then pretty much everything else of course as you know is offered just in the cloud."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars' website in which he quotes SAP, CFO, Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference. And I quote, \u201cI have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle.\u201d In other words, after personally, checking SAP's Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer move into Oracle Fusion on ERP, not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully. In Q3 alone we signed contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers, to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list of over a 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, or currently in the process of doing so. I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into two distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the fusion ERP suite, including core financials, it's Oracle wall-to-wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications, but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They have begun the migration, but they are not committed to doing the entire suite as yet, or they are not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet. Okay. So let me go to start the list. TPS Company, an industrial manufacturer of rail cars in North America replaced out all of the SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything with the fusion cloud, complete replacement of SAP ERP to fusion ERP. G4S plc security services firm, the world's largest security company by revenue, complete replacement of SAP R/3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. First Solar, North America's only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States replaced SAP's S4/HANA, Ariba, Concur third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion, HCM, and supply chain management. Transit Wireless, a North American telco completely replaced out SAP R/3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM. West Sussex County Council, a complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP now, HCM, EPM is Oracle Enterprise Performance Management, complete wall-to-wall Oracle at West Sussex County Council, no more SAP. CEMEX, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer, private labels bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain, transportation management, et cetera. New Zealand Inland Revenue, complete SAP R/3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. University of The Andes in Latin America, the number one university in Colombia, a complete replacement of \u2013 they had SAP for 10 years, replaced it with Oracle ERP, HCM, EPM, supply chain, sales, everything. Bip&Drive, a travel and transportation company in EMEA, electronic toll payment provider for the roadways in Spain, again, replaced \u2013 was offered a free S/4HANA upgrade, instead chose Oracle Fusion Cloud. GE Grid Software, an industrial manufacturer software for utilities and power transmissions, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP Fusion Cloud. Postcon, let's say the second largest mail carrier in Germany, SAP complete replacement of RP, replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management. Birmingham City Council, complete SAP replacement using Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM. They are the biggest city council in the UK. Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation, a toll road developer in Asia. SAP replacement got rid of SAP and replaced with Oracle ERP and Oracle EPM. Africa World Airlines replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. Batelco, that's the Bahrain telephone company, they had been running SAP for a decade and they moved to Fusion Cloud, ERP, EPM and HCM. European Logistics and Applied Engineering group, actually the name \u2013 they don't want their name specifically mentioned. They are the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3 and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA and the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP.  TICO Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America had SAP \u2013 had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP at the end of the sales. FedEx, FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They replaced out all of the \u2013 they are in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions and Oracle in other divisions. They're replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Western Digital, a complete replacement, they had SAP. Western Digital had SAP and SanDisk. They had SAP at HGST, replaced all of that out and have standardized an Oracle Fusion in the \u2013 Fusion ERP in the cloud. VP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR, R/3. They eliminated all of that. By the way in EMEA marine terminal operator, they are located in EMEA. They are global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized an Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud. Cohu, they are a semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP replaced out all of the SAP ERP and are standardized on Oracle. This one is interesting. They don't want their name mentioned. They are a huge European \u2013 North American and European manufacturer of ATMs and they've replaced out all of SAP and the German subsidiary BOSSY throughout the world and they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM and they have added Oracle Performance Management, Fusion Performance Management. Let's see. Another company whose name they don't want to be mentioned, let's see, they are a high-tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R/3, ERP, HCM and standardized an Oracle Fusion, Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Albelli Group, they are a manufacturer of photo products in the UK. They replaced an SAP with, guess what Fusion ERP. Consol Energy, utilities company in Pittsburgh replaced out SAP with Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Enbridge, Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada, replaced out all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP. Gemini Industries \u2013 Gemini Energy, they are an LAV, they are an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil with substations all across Brazil, replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. GoodStorage in Latin America, the self-storage company in Brazil, again, got rid of SAP, put Infusion ERP. Grupo Globo, they are on media and entertainment, Latin America's largest media and entertainment company, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM. IQVIA, a complete SAP replacement. They are manufacturing pharmaceutical company in North America. They've moved away from SAP standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. Corrigan, a healthcare company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion. NatWest Group, NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They're replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Wind Tre, Wind Tre is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy, again completely replacing out SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP, SCM and EPM. Okay. Now I want to go onto the second group \u2013 second group of companies and these are companies that had started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet \u2013 they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they're buying our supply chain. They're buying our procurement, They're buying our transportation management. They're buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials. So I want to be very specific that they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products. GN Airlines, Apollo Tyres, Achema, an adhesive solutions company in the UK, Aarhus Kommune, their municipality in Central Denmark, Caesars Enterprise Services, they have an idea \u2013 they bought Procurement in Supply Chain, a big hospitality company obviously in North America. Sheppard Danaher a product lifecycle management, they are a healthcare company. Department of Education and Training in Australia, they bought procurement.  DHL with an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running on SAP, but the new implementations they're going in are in other countries, not in Germany as yet, in other countries are, Oracle Fusion ERP. Dove bought supply chain management and transportation management. Temsa [ph] bought \u2013 replaced all of SAP and some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse management, supply chain planning, ERP. Again in some \u2013 and some subsidiaries all of ERP including an accounting procurement, all of that. Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan. Again the parent is running SAP financials but subs all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Keurig Dr Pepper, again \u2013 bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of \u2013 financial services company in North America, bought all of ERP. Honda bought supply [indiscernible] SAP Financials just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion transportation management and has moved into the \u2013 from on-premise to the cloud. InvoTech, again a North American company \u2013 again, but parent still running SAP financials but the subs are running Oracle Fusion. Jackson Life, Lakshmi Cement, I'm not going to \u2013 I am going to read this faster now, Juniper Networks, Lloyds Bank, Move Incorporated, Munich Re, the largest food company in the world, bought \u2013 just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing, Orlando International, PG&E, Porcelanosa, Republic Services, SAC Wireless and Nokia Company, Samsonite, Puma, Santander Bank, Therma-Tru Doors. Okay. I am going to stop right there or I'll take up all of the time you won't be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don't want to do that. Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than 100-plus companies. I did read over 100 companies as I'm sure you painfully aware of. List is actually longer than the 100 companies I have just read. Some are most important wins and are very largest companies in regulated industries such as banking and utilities who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don't \u2013 even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don't want to be on \u2013 their name on this call, because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they \u2013 even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP. All right. So I'd like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically trying to answer one key question. How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before. A major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don't take my word for it. Read the report, it's very short and it's to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front, I mean far \u2013 you can find a magic quadrant where there is more a bigger gap between number one and number two. And so, Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems. But what's surprising is SAP isn't number two. SAP is at number three. SAP is listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the lagger. Gartner \u2013 if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, SAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors. I want to read that again. \u201cSAP's own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors.\u201d SAP, the once-dominant on-premise ERP market leader is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that has happened because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It's that same with 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud and it's too late for them to start now. I'll turn it back over to Safra. The answer is I think there's no question. You're going to see a lot of database growth \u2013 a lot of database acceleration starting next year which we're a quarter away from. But we'll be fine in Q4. Again, its autonomous databases is growing pretty rapidly. But we expect it really to explode next year. And I really do mean very, very rapid growth next year. I'm not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it's going to suddenly spike but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year. I acknowledge for interrupting. The really spectacular logos [indiscernible] there's some of them are pretty spectacular on there. But we have some that are much larger and much \u2013 and absolutely shocking. I've been alluding to these, but sometimes we're in the middle of an 18-month implementation. And the customer doesn't want any mention. If I could mention them all, it would be \u2013 it's front page news. I mean it's a very big deal. Yes. I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is \u2013 I think a long time ago, I said there are two technologies that will drive Oracle's future, one is the autonomous database and the other is ERP. We are \u2013 reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number more than half of SAP's customers we'll get. But keeping our own, yes, plus getting a lot of it from the smaller companies like M4 and Lawson. Okay. So there are two lists. One, the first half of the list that I read and they're about equal sized lists where people that are already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list where people that had partially moved to Oracle, but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out. If we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that, but they still run SAP financials we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy. But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAPs on premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that it started the journey, we'll finish the journey. And they'll want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud, in procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect company \u2013 we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement, they buy supply chain and they see, okay, I like that. And I'm going to buy financials. So yes, we expect all of those or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything. Yes. Well I think there are two things that are interesting about OCI. One on the security front. One is we believe security should be always be turned on and in other words, there is no light switch, security on, security off. We have these things called max security zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off and max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this, where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link \u2013 a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on. The second thing is autonomy is very interesting, because the Oracle autonomous database, by the way, the Oracle autonomous database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have autonomous Linux that is the foundation of OCS, the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle autonomous, Linux, Oracle autonomous database has no human labor associated with them. Okay. So everyone says, well, that's a huge cost saving. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit if there is no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there's no human mission, there's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data. So, we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI, other than its high performance, low cost, all of that, everyone likes to pay less and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers. So well we started 10 years ago to build fusion financials for the cloud to rewrite all \u2013 PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP, and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite, we had these three separate on-premise ERP systems, and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that with the cloud. And SAP unbelievably, they just, I mean \u2013 and we did a very good job. We started a decade ago and we did, I think, a very good job redoing a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud. That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur, they bought Ariba, they bought SuccessFactors, but they never \u2013 and we made some acquisitions also by the way, [indiscernible] and others right now at other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead, embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean, it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database and the, the thing we're competing with at so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, is what the SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP, this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java. And it's been entirely rewritten overload over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old. The same that they've always had, that they now will host for you. So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud, SAP just entirely missed the boat.  So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened. And their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You are on the cloud, you get new features and functions, you are on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is okay, you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened. It's amazing."

Now I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of customers mentioned on this conference call as well as many others which have purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will also be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect those forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. We'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and then we'll take your questions. However, I want to remind everybody we will not be making any comments regarding TikTok. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra?\nLawrence Ellison: Hello. I can't hear anything.\nKen Bond: Safra, are you on mute?\nSafra Catz: Yes, I'm here. Sorry. Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. I first want to highlight that since our own migration to Fusion ERP, we've continued to close our books faster and faster. This quarter, we are reporting our results for our entire global operations 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter. In fact, using Fusion ERP, we submitted our 10-K and 10-Q filings faster than any other company in the S&P 500, in fact, 21 days faster than the average. Understanding our business performance sooner is an advantage that we enjoy by using Fusion ERP, and it's one our Fusion customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. On to the quarter. So this quarter, revenue was $40 million above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS beat the high end of guidance by $0.04. The impact of currency movement was in line with guidance, meaning that our outperformance reflects both continuing execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations. Operating income grew 12%, our best result in 8 years. Our total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Over the last 4 years, we have doubled the percentage of revenue that is being derived from our cloud services. That is what's driving our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue higher and higher, now reaching 73% of total company revenue. We anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services continue to grow. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, with strategic back-office applications up 26%, including Fusion ERP which was up 33%; NetSuite ERP up 20%, and Fusion HCM up 24%. Also retention rates for strategic back-office cloud applications, which are already high, continued to go even higher. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.2 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 5%. Consumption revenue was up 64% for Autonomous Database and up 139% for OCI, our cloud Gen 2. License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 5%. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 2% in USD, and up 1% in constant currency. As usual, we've continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses down 7% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 billion, up 12% from last year. Obviously, we're delighted with this result as we're continuing to see operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. I continue to have a very high level of confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate as our cloud business continues to become a much bigger portion of total revenue. The operating margin percentage was 47%, up more than 450 basis points from 42% last year, and as I said, our best result since 2012. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.7%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.06 in USD, up 19% and up 17% in constant currency despite interest income being $120 million lower than last year [ph] and interest expense being $135 million higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 17.8% as a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.80 in USD, up 16% and up 13% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14 billion with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.1 billion over the same period. Q2 operating cash flow was $1.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion last year, with collections especially strong this quarter from a bigger book of business and to a lesser extent delayed payments received from customers affected by the pandemic. We now have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is unchanged at $8.1 billion. However, the short-term gross deferred revenue grew 6% in U.S. dollars. The difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased more than 68 million shares for a total of $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 338 million shares for a total of $18.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 42%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% positive impact on total revenue, maybe even a little bit more like 1.5-ish, and potentially a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 2% to 4% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 10% to 14% and be between $1.06 and $1.10 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 13% and 17% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20%, but however, as you can see, one-time tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average this year at 20% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we had supply. To remedy this capacity shortfall, we are adding OCI capacity and building new OCI datacenters as fast as we can. We are now up to 29 regional data centers around the world, more than AWS. OCI added customers and grew revenue at a rate well in excess of 100% year-over-year in Q2. The Oracle Autonomous Database was up over 50%. We also introduced several new OCI managed services during the quarter. The most interesting of these new OCI managed services is for the popular open source database, MySQL, featuring an all-new, Oracle-developed, massively parallel query accelerator called Heat Wave. MySQL plus Heat Wave processes queries hundreds of times faster, hundreds of times faster than the current version of MySQL by itself and other MySQL-compatible databases, such as Amazon's Aurora. MySQL plus Heat Wave is so much faster, so much easier to use and less expensive than PostgreS, Redshift, Snowflake or any other database available on Amazon AWS. The amazing thing about Heat Wave is that you don't have to move your data out of MySQL and build a separate data warehouse to get the huge performance gains. You simply take any existing MySQL or Aurora database, run that exact same database on the new MySQL version that includes Heat Wave , and immediately, your queries run hundreds of times faster. You don't have to change a single line of code. It can't get any easier to use than that. Now I'd like to change subject and talk about our multibillion-dollar application businesses in the cloud. Fusion EPS -- Fusion ERP grew 33% in Q2 to over 7,500 customers. NetSuite grew 21% to over 24,000 customers. We have the top-rated ERP products on both Gartner and IDC. There is no large-scale enterprise application business in the cloud that's growing as fast as we are. In the coming months, our cloud ERP market leadership will become even more obvious when we announce that several major large-scale SAP ERP customers are leaving SAP and moving to our Fusion ERP cloud. Oracle is the clear market leader in cloud ERP. Finally, I'd like to talk about our all-new, cloud-based national electronic health record system and health management application suite that Oracle built in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This system has already been used to register more than 0.5 million people for clinical trials run in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. Last month, in partnership with the Tony Blair Institute, we used this same exact national electronic health record system to manage the distribution of yellow fever vaccine in Africa. 7,000 people in Ghana were vaccinated during the first week of the program. We're very proud of that. We are currently in discussions with dozens of countries around the world to adopt Oracle's new national electronic health record system to modernize their national public health infrastructure, thus enabling efficient COVID-19 vaccine management therapeutic monitoring and diagnostic testing. Normally, at this point, I'd begin to read a list of notable new customers that we acquired during the quarter. But our new more efficient track will be to provide you with a list of those customers attached to our detailed financial quarterly numbers. So immersively, you will be able to read the list for yourself and no longer will you have to endure me reading it to you. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Erica, if we could queue up, I'll start off the Q&A. And just a reminder no questions on TikTok. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Safra, I wanted to go back to your comments from June. On your Q4 call, when you talked about what was going on under the hood of your constant currency revenue growth, and you mentioned that the growing businesses were growing at a 30% CAGR, the declining businesses at about a double-digit decline and the stable ones were up 1% to 2%. I'm just wondering taking a look today and kind of how you're thinking about the future, how is the pandemic changing these growth rates, if at all, especially as OCI and things like Cloud Customer become even bigger areas of focus for customers?\nSafra Catz: So, the pandemic affects us, in some ways, negatively; in some ways, positively, simply because of our size and the breadth of our customer base, it affects them differently. And so obviously, our hospitality customers have had a very difficult time of it in the main. Some of our retail customers have done horribly, some have done very, very well. What has become very clear to our customers is that those that are digitally forward and that can work also under -- with a lot of automation using a digital tool, using our technology, using the cloud, they are faring far, far better. And as a result, we see change occurring, and you can see it in our ERP SaaS numbers, in our HCM numbers, NetSuite numbers, you can just see that those numbers continue to do very, very well. And then, of course, our Gen 2 cloud, whether it's compute where many of our customers are using way more than they expected to, and as Larry said, just blowing out our internal forecast such that we will need a few more weeks to really catch up with our demand while we're also expanding globally simultaneously. So, we actually believe that this remains very consistent. Obviously, there was uncertainty before because of the pandemic. At this point, I think it's very clear that our business is accelerating, our stable businesses remain stable, and our shrinking businesses whether it's nonstrategic hardware or other things, those continue to get smaller. But generally, the overall revenue number will be showing acceleration even in this pandemic, and I almost feel badly saying, maybe it helped ultimately because many of our customers have realized the importance of using technology to deal with their customers, their employees, and their suppliers.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you. And happy holidays to you and your families.\nSafra Catz: Thank you. You too, Heather.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Congrats on a good quarter and strong guidance. Larry, I've got maybe a bigger question -- a bigger picture question for you. I know you appreciate there are generational aspects to IT where, most often, the winner in the last generation isn't the winner in the next. But under your leadership and vision and Safra's operational discipline, Oracle has been an industry leader for over 4 decades by thinking strategically about the future. And today, we hear amazing feedback on Oracle's latest innovations, the actual underlying technology like OCI and Autonomous. And by that alone, it would seem the future is bright for Oracle, but we've also seen in the past that the best technology doesn't always win. What gives you confidence that Oracle can remain successful and appeal to younger generation, many who think cloud-first and want to move really, really fast?\nLawrence Ellison: All right. Well, let me start in two areas. I've always said there are 2 key aspects of Oracle's future, one is the Autonomous Database, which is a cloud-only product. It works at Cloud and Cloud at Customer. So, it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So, query processing, we\u2019re much faster than Snowflake, the market's current darling. And in transaction processing, we're much faster than anybody. So, we have a single unified database that is fully autonomous. It never goes down. It patches itself. Nobody else is making claims anything like that. So, we have a vast leadership in -- plus we have, by far, the largest installed base. And our database business continues to grow. Some of our other businesses, our middleware businesses have declined, but our database business continued to grow throughout the move to the cloud. So, we're very confident we're going to hold on to our database franchise. We're convinced that -- I mean, they really don't have any strong competition. One of -- and you can see there's not a lot of strong competition from Amazon because what's going on with Snow -- if you're curious what's happening with Snowflake, Snowflake is a decent product, it\u2019s a good product, I think. And it's just killing Redshift over at Amazon. So, it's doing extremely well, but it doesn't remotely compare to Oracle's Autonomous Database. It doesn't do transactions at all. And in fact, query processing is not even close to assess as the Oracle database. So we're -- but it's much better than what Amazon has. And when it's competing inside of AWS, it does very well. It will kill Redshift. Redshift is not very good. So, we think we have a huge lead in database, and that no one's trying to do what we're doing. I mean none of the stuff patches itself. None of the stuff never goes down. That's true. The -- okay, that's holding on to our database franchise. The next thing is ERP. SAP forgot to move their ERP system to the cloud. They just built -- they decided instead to go compete with Oracle with HANA. They don't have a cloud product. We have -- if you look at Gartner and SAP, SAP asked to be moved off the Gartner list because SAP was in the lower left-hand corner. They're not even considered a cloud system by Gartner, SAP for ERP. So, we are -- we have dominant -- we have over 30,000 customers in the cloud, running our Cloud ERP systems. Who's second? Workday with a few hundred? I mean it's not close. And that's the largest applications business. That's the largest applications business on premise, and it will be the largest applications business in the cloud, and we're the overwhelming technology and market leader. So, I think those 2 lynchpins, the Autonomous Database and the Oracle ERP in the cloud secure our future. Now add to that, OCI, which is new for us, we've never been a platform company. We -- Linux is a platform. In the old on-premise days, Linux was a platform, Windows was the most famous platform. There was HP-UX and IBM Metazone offering. So there were a lot of platforms. We weren't ever in that business. We were portable and ran on lots of different platforms. Now we have our own platform for the first time. And our platform is competing very well against AWS and Microsoft, and we think we have way better technology on our platform than the other guys. And we're winning lots and lots of customers to our platform. That's an all-new initiative for us to go into the platform business. So again, we're moving from #2 to #1 in cloud applications. Again, we have the fastest-growing, cloud -- large-scale cloud applications business on the planet. Who has a multibillion-dollar cloud business that's growing at 33%? I mean maybe there's somebody, I don't know who it is. Who has anything like autonomous database technology? And who has a cloud platform that's being picked by some of the most sophisticated technology companies on earth over AWS and Microsoft? So I guess those are the 3 pieces: OCI, Autonomous Database and Fusion ERP in the cloud that gives me confidence that we're going to get our fair share of the new generation of cloud applications and infrastructure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Congrats on the quarter. Larry, following up on the last questions, if you don't mind. Given that the world is going to start to vaccinate and we would expect that IT focus could be more on on-premise in the cloud and work from home, I'd like to get a better understanding of what you're seeing and what you're expecting to Autonomous Database running in the cloud and Cloud at Customer, when do you think we see that big inflection we've been hoping for that could drive revenue acceleration?\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. So again, the interesting thing about Cloud at Customer, the change in our business model. So you've got to remember, when we sign a huge Cloud at Customer deal and we deliver a bunch of Exadata to a customer, we recognized, let's see, how much revenue, nothing, versus selling a bunch of Exadata. So what's happened -- remember, we're going from selling Exadata machine to delivering them for free and then charging, if you will, rental or usage on the machines as we go from selling hardware to selling Exadata Cloud at Customer. So our accounting model, you say, well, wow, Oracle's revenue is flat. Well, flat, maybe not so bad, actually it's growing somewhat. But keep in mind, where we used to get paid for Exadata machines right away, we now deliver them at Cloud at Customer, and we have to wait to get those monthly revenues over a 4-year period. So what you're seeing is this change in model, and Cloud at Customer is already doing pretty well. It's just there's a huge lag. There's histories. From the time -- there's a lag from the time we start selling a bunch of these things until all the revenue starts coming in. So that's what's going on right now where it's already a very successful product. We're selling a lot of them. Our sales are accelerating, but there's this time lag between sales and the revenue, very different than selling a database license or selling an Exadata machine. As we move to the new model, it's a more profitable model long term, but it doesn't have the instantaneous impact. So there's this time lag. And that's what you're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turits with Keybanc.\nMichael Turits: Congrats on the quarter. Larry, you talked a lot about ERP, and that's been a lot of where the messaging has been around Fusion apps. But this has been a really strong year even during COVID, around front office. Can you talk a little bit about your CX business and whether or not you could see acceleration there and particularly how some of your AI capabilities are playing into that, if they are?\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. Well, they are actually because we're making -- actually, I've been directly involved with a major push in CX. And we've come out with several new CX products, one of which is our product and references system where we have a product references database that we sell, and we have an AI engine that sits on top of it. And what it does, it tells -- it interfaces to our sales automation system. And it tells customers or it tells salespeople what product they should be selling this particular customer next. It's got a recommendations engine. And it will tell -- it will also tell the salesperson what are the best references when you're selling customer A Fusion ERP. And then it will actually -- go out and find those references and prepare a micro -- a website, a micro site for that prospect to go to. So we are enhancing our sales automation which, heretofore, sales automation really has not been about automating sales. Sales automation, which was pioneered by salesforce.com, sales automation is all about opportunity management and forecasting. Our new sales automation is all about giving salespeople tools, enabling them to sell more. It automatically generates proposals. It automatically generates reference list. It automatically generates micro sites. It automatically generates recommendations of what the salesperson should be selling to this customer next, what module. So these are the kind of products, what we call automated lead generation and qualification built into the selling system, the product reference system. We also have another new product that's coming out in CX, which we think is very important, which is the ability to launch an advertising campaign from a computer console without going through ad agencies. It's funny, this disintermediates the ad business, so that you can, again, target -- let's say, we're selling Fusion ERP to an oil company, a large oil company, and we want to advertise to people in that oil company, the decision makers, the CEO, the CFO, people in accounting, all of that, we can then launch an ad campaign targeting those people and with references for Fusion ERP. So rather than when they log on to look at Google News, rather than them seeing ads for Nike shoes where they were recently browsing the website, they're going to see ads for Oracle Fusion ERP. So we have an ad system. So we're doing a bunch of that -- by the way, no one is doing this but us. We're the only one that's doing this ability to target people and launch ads from a console. We're the only ones that -- I mean people do it on the consumer side but not on the B2B side. We're doing that on the B2B side. We're the only ones that are using the recommendation engine the way that we are not only to recommend what to sell next but who the best references are and actually preparing the micro site for the prospects to examine those references. So I think the CX is a huge opportunity for us. The fact that we have CX linked to our ERP, we have front office linked to our ERP, linked to our HCM system, it's a huge advantage that we have front office, we have HCM, we have back office, we link it all together. It's much more valuable when you have all the front office and back-office data in a single database. It allows you to do the kind of innovative things we're doing in the front office. So again, that's -- you're going to see a major improvement in our portfolio in the front office over the coming months.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats from me as well. You guys have been very good and disciplined. So you wouldn't kind of build data centers just for the sake of building data center. So if I look at the momentum here, like 14 new this year, at 29 now, going up to 38 in a few months. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? What's kind of driving that momentum because that's super impressive.\nSafra Catz: Larry, do you want to take it?\nLawrence Ellison: Safra, do you want to...\nSafra Catz: Well, let me -- you go ahead, Larry. Go ahead.\nLawrence Ellison: All right. We're just seeing demand for our products all over the world. Our data -- we're going to 1 data center, an OCI data center, that runs not only all of our technology, like Autonomous Database and our high-performance computing, all of that stuff, but it runs all of our applications as well. So we're seeing demand for these products all over the world, and we are going into more countries. We've decided -- our strategy is, because we have a large existing business, we have a large existing installed base, we believe we just have to get into more countries than someone -- than Amazon, let's say, because we have to serve those countries where we have a large installed base, like Indonesia, let's say, which is a very big country, but a lot of people don't have data centers in Indonesia. Israel, I mean, it's very important to get a good data center in Israel. Some of the cloud companies has been late to get there. We think that's a very important marketplace. So we think we have been building as fast as we can, but we've been trying not to build ahead of demand. And we were doing a pretty good job actually until this last quarter where demand was actually turned out to exceed our ambitions, where our plan for growth, though it's a very ambitious plan, still on the demand side, we have some large customers that just wanted more capacity than we could supply. And that bit us in Q2. Hopefully, it will be -- as Safra said, we're probably a month or two away from correcting that and getting ahead of that curve. But we just see right now there's more demand than we can supply. So we're going -- as I said, what are we doing? We're going as fast as we possibly can.\nSafra Catz: Yes. Let me just add a couple of things. One is we have upped our capital spending plans because the demand is so strong that we've increased it by probably this next quarter, probably be 50% higher than this last one just to keep everything going and growing. I also want to point out that some of our customers do not want to go into a big public data center but for different reasons, regulatory reasons or others, one have Cloud at Customer, and that's very important that we are able to offer that. And in addition, some of them have extremely a large requirement and are basically a private region. Those aren't in the numbers you were mentioning as far as data center build-outs, but that's another area where we are expanding and consumption is increasing at very, very large rate. So we're very busy here just keeping up with demand.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Appreciate you joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Yes, I'm here. Sorry. Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. I first want to highlight that since our own migration to Fusion ERP, we've continued to close our books faster and faster. This quarter, we are reporting our results for our entire global operations 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter. In fact, using Fusion ERP, we submitted our 10-K and 10-Q filings faster than any other company in the S&P 500, in fact, 21 days faster than the average. Understanding our business performance sooner is an advantage that we enjoy by using Fusion ERP, and it's one our Fusion customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. On to the quarter. So this quarter, revenue was $40 million above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS beat the high end of guidance by $0.04. The impact of currency movement was in line with guidance, meaning that our outperformance reflects both continuing execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations. Operating income grew 12%, our best result in 8 years. Our total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Over the last 4 years, we have doubled the percentage of revenue that is being derived from our cloud services. That is what's driving our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue higher and higher, now reaching 73% of total company revenue. We anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services continue to grow. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, with strategic back-office applications up 26%, including Fusion ERP which was up 33%; NetSuite ERP up 20%, and Fusion HCM up 24%. Also retention rates for strategic back-office cloud applications, which are already high, continued to go even higher. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.2 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 5%. Consumption revenue was up 64% for Autonomous Database and up 139% for OCI, our cloud Gen 2. License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 5%. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 2% in USD, and up 1% in constant currency. As usual, we've continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses down 7% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 billion, up 12% from last year. Obviously, we're delighted with this result as we're continuing to see operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. I continue to have a very high level of confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate as our cloud business continues to become a much bigger portion of total revenue. The operating margin percentage was 47%, up more than 450 basis points from 42% last year, and as I said, our best result since 2012. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.7%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.06 in USD, up 19% and up 17% in constant currency despite interest income being $120 million lower than last year [ph] and interest expense being $135 million higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 17.8% as a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.80 in USD, up 16% and up 13% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14 billion with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.1 billion over the same period. Q2 operating cash flow was $1.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion last year, with collections especially strong this quarter from a bigger book of business and to a lesser extent delayed payments received from customers affected by the pandemic. We now have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is unchanged at $8.1 billion. However, the short-term gross deferred revenue grew 6% in U.S. dollars. The difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased more than 68 million shares for a total of $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 338 million shares for a total of $18.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 42%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% positive impact on total revenue, maybe even a little bit more like 1.5-ish, and potentially a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 2% to 4% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 10% to 14% and be between $1.06 and $1.10 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 13% and 17% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20%, but however, as you can see, one-time tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average this year at 20% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. So, the pandemic affects us, in some ways, negatively; in some ways, positively, simply because of our size and the breadth of our customer base, it affects them differently. And so obviously, our hospitality customers have had a very difficult time of it in the main. Some of our retail customers have done horribly, some have done very, very well. What has become very clear to our customers is that those that are digitally forward and that can work also under -- with a lot of automation using a digital tool, using our technology, using the cloud, they are faring far, far better. And as a result, we see change occurring, and you can see it in our ERP SaaS numbers, in our HCM numbers, NetSuite numbers, you can just see that those numbers continue to do very, very well. And then, of course, our Gen 2 cloud, whether it's compute where many of our customers are using way more than they expected to, and as Larry said, just blowing out our internal forecast such that we will need a few more weeks to really catch up with our demand while we're also expanding globally simultaneously. So, we actually believe that this remains very consistent. Obviously, there was uncertainty before because of the pandemic. At this point, I think it's very clear that our business is accelerating, our stable businesses remain stable, and our shrinking businesses whether it's nonstrategic hardware or other things, those continue to get smaller. But generally, the overall revenue number will be showing acceleration even in this pandemic, and I almost feel badly saying, maybe it helped ultimately because many of our customers have realized the importance of using technology to deal with their customers, their employees, and their suppliers. Thank you. You too, Heather. Larry, do you want to take it? Well, let me -- you go ahead, Larry. Go ahead. Yes. Let me just add a couple of things. One is we have upped our capital spending plans because the demand is so strong that we've increased it by probably this next quarter, probably be 50% higher than this last one just to keep everything going and growing. I also want to point out that some of our customers do not want to go into a big public data center but for different reasons, regulatory reasons or others, one have Cloud at Customer, and that's very important that we are able to offer that. And in addition, some of them have extremely a large requirement and are basically a private region. Those aren't in the numbers you were mentioning as far as data center build-outs, but that's another area where we are expanding and consumption is increasing at very, very large rate. So we're very busy here just keeping up with demand."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Hello. I can't hear anything. Thank you, Safra. We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we had supply. To remedy this capacity shortfall, we are adding OCI capacity and building new OCI datacenters as fast as we can. We are now up to 29 regional data centers around the world, more than AWS. OCI added customers and grew revenue at a rate well in excess of 100% year-over-year in Q2. The Oracle Autonomous Database was up over 50%. We also introduced several new OCI managed services during the quarter. The most interesting of these new OCI managed services is for the popular open source database, MySQL, featuring an all-new, Oracle-developed, massively parallel query accelerator called Heat Wave. MySQL plus Heat Wave processes queries hundreds of times faster, hundreds of times faster than the current version of MySQL by itself and other MySQL-compatible databases, such as Amazon's Aurora. MySQL plus Heat Wave is so much faster, so much easier to use and less expensive than PostgreS, Redshift, Snowflake or any other database available on Amazon AWS. The amazing thing about Heat Wave is that you don't have to move your data out of MySQL and build a separate data warehouse to get the huge performance gains. You simply take any existing MySQL or Aurora database, run that exact same database on the new MySQL version that includes Heat Wave , and immediately, your queries run hundreds of times faster. You don't have to change a single line of code. It can't get any easier to use than that. Now I'd like to change subject and talk about our multibillion-dollar application businesses in the cloud. Fusion EPS -- Fusion ERP grew 33% in Q2 to over 7,500 customers. NetSuite grew 21% to over 24,000 customers. We have the top-rated ERP products on both Gartner and IDC. There is no large-scale enterprise application business in the cloud that's growing as fast as we are. In the coming months, our cloud ERP market leadership will become even more obvious when we announce that several major large-scale SAP ERP customers are leaving SAP and moving to our Fusion ERP cloud. Oracle is the clear market leader in cloud ERP. Finally, I'd like to talk about our all-new, cloud-based national electronic health record system and health management application suite that Oracle built in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This system has already been used to register more than 0.5 million people for clinical trials run in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. Last month, in partnership with the Tony Blair Institute, we used this same exact national electronic health record system to manage the distribution of yellow fever vaccine in Africa. 7,000 people in Ghana were vaccinated during the first week of the program. We're very proud of that. We are currently in discussions with dozens of countries around the world to adopt Oracle's new national electronic health record system to modernize their national public health infrastructure, thus enabling efficient COVID-19 vaccine management therapeutic monitoring and diagnostic testing. Normally, at this point, I'd begin to read a list of notable new customers that we acquired during the quarter. But our new more efficient track will be to provide you with a list of those customers attached to our detailed financial quarterly numbers. So immersively, you will be able to read the list for yourself and no longer will you have to endure me reading it to you. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken. All right. Well, let me start in two areas. I've always said there are 2 key aspects of Oracle's future, one is the Autonomous Database, which is a cloud-only product. It works at Cloud and Cloud at Customer. So, it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So, query processing, we're much faster than Snowflake, the market's current darling. And in transaction processing, we're much faster than anybody. So, we have a single unified database that is fully autonomous. It never goes down. It patches itself. Nobody else is making claims anything like that. So, we have a vast leadership in -- plus we have, by far, the largest installed base. And our database business continues to grow. Some of our other businesses, our middleware businesses have declined, but our database business continued to grow throughout the move to the cloud. So, we're very confident we're going to hold on to our database franchise. We're convinced that -- I mean, they really don't have any strong competition. One of -- and you can see there's not a lot of strong competition from Amazon because what's going on with Snow -- if you're curious what's happening with Snowflake, Snowflake is a decent product, it's a good product, I think. And it's just killing Redshift over at Amazon. So, it's doing extremely well, but it doesn't remotely compare to Oracle's Autonomous Database. It doesn't do transactions at all. And in fact, query processing is not even close to assess as the Oracle database. So we're -- but it's much better than what Amazon has. And when it's competing inside of AWS, it does very well. It will kill Redshift. Redshift is not very good. So, we think we have a huge lead in database, and that no one's trying to do what we're doing. I mean none of the stuff patches itself. None of the stuff never goes down. That's true. The -- okay, that's holding on to our database franchise. The next thing is ERP. SAP forgot to move their ERP system to the cloud. They just built -- they decided instead to go compete with Oracle with HANA. They don't have a cloud product. We have -- if you look at Gartner and SAP, SAP asked to be moved off the Gartner list because SAP was in the lower left-hand corner. They're not even considered a cloud system by Gartner, SAP for ERP. So, we are -- we have dominant -- we have over 30,000 customers in the cloud, running our Cloud ERP systems. Who's second? Workday with a few hundred? I mean it's not close. And that's the largest applications business. That's the largest applications business on premise, and it will be the largest applications business in the cloud, and we're the overwhelming technology and market leader. So, I think those 2 lynchpins, the Autonomous Database and the Oracle ERP in the cloud secure our future. Now add to that, OCI, which is new for us, we've never been a platform company. We -- Linux is a platform. In the old on-premise days, Linux was a platform, Windows was the most famous platform. There was HP-UX and IBM Metazone offering. So there were a lot of platforms. We weren't ever in that business. We were portable and ran on lots of different platforms. Now we have our own platform for the first time. And our platform is competing very well against AWS and Microsoft, and we think we have way better technology on our platform than the other guys. And we're winning lots and lots of customers to our platform. That's an all-new initiative for us to go into the platform business. So again, we're moving from #2 to #1 in cloud applications. Again, we have the fastest-growing, cloud -- large-scale cloud applications business on the planet. Who has a multibillion-dollar cloud business that's growing at 33%? I mean maybe there's somebody, I don't know who it is. Who has anything like autonomous database technology? And who has a cloud platform that's being picked by some of the most sophisticated technology companies on earth over AWS and Microsoft? So I guess those are the 3 pieces: OCI, Autonomous Database and Fusion ERP in the cloud that gives me confidence that we're going to get our fair share of the new generation of cloud applications and infrastructure. Yes. So again, the interesting thing about Cloud at Customer, the change in our business model. So you've got to remember, when we sign a huge Cloud at Customer deal and we deliver a bunch of Exadata to a customer, we recognized, let's see, how much revenue, nothing, versus selling a bunch of Exadata. So what's happened -- remember, we're going from selling Exadata machine to delivering them for free and then charging, if you will, rental or usage on the machines as we go from selling hardware to selling Exadata Cloud at Customer. So our accounting model, you say, well, wow, Oracle's revenue is flat. Well, flat, maybe not so bad, actually it's growing somewhat. But keep in mind, where we used to get paid for Exadata machines right away, we now deliver them at Cloud at Customer, and we have to wait to get those monthly revenues over a 4-year period. So what you're seeing is this change in model, and Cloud at Customer is already doing pretty well. It's just there's a huge lag. There's histories. From the time -- there's a lag from the time we start selling a bunch of these things until all the revenue starts coming in. So that's what's going on right now where it's already a very successful product. We're selling a lot of them. Our sales are accelerating, but there's this time lag between sales and the revenue, very different than selling a database license or selling an Exadata machine. As we move to the new model, it's a more profitable model long term, but it doesn't have the instantaneous impact. So there's this time lag. And that's what you're seeing. Yes. Well, they are actually because we're making -- actually, I've been directly involved with a major push in CX. And we've come out with several new CX products, one of which is our product and references system where we have a product references database that we sell, and we have an AI engine that sits on top of it. And what it does, it tells -- it interfaces to our sales automation system. And it tells customers or it tells salespeople what product they should be selling this particular customer next. It's got a recommendations engine. And it will tell -- it will also tell the salesperson what are the best references when you're selling customer A Fusion ERP. And then it will actually -- go out and find those references and prepare a micro -- a website, a micro site for that prospect to go to.

So we have an ad system. So we're doing a bunch of that -- by the way, no one is doing this but us. We're the only one that's doing this ability to target people and launch ads from a console.

We're the only ones that are using the recommendation engine the way that we are not only to recommend what to sell next but who the best references are and actually preparing the micro site for the prospects to examine those references. So I think the CX is a huge opportunity for us. The fact that we have CX linked to our ERP, we have front office linked to our ERP, linked to our HCM system, it's a huge advantage that we have front office, we have HCM, we have back office, we link it all together. It's much more valuable when you have all the front office and back-office data in a single database. It allows you to do the kind of innovative things we're doing in the front office.

Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask. So, now to Oracle's results, as you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. This quarter revenue was more than 150 million above the midpoint of guidance and EPS was [$0.70] above the mid. Currency helps a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side, and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in three years. As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our fusion fast momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of autonomous database, which will continue to get even better now that we have autonomous database available on Cloud@Customer. Our total Cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were 6.9 billion, up 2% from last year and accounted for 74% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues were 2.8 billion, up 4%, but our Fusion app were up 26% with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. On our Fusion retention rates, which are already high continue to go up. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were 4.1 billion, up to 1%, but with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous database consumption revenue was up 64% and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. Licensed revenues were 886 million, up 8%. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter were 9.4 billion, up 2%. As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was 4.2 billion and as I said, up 8% from last year and our best operating income growth in three years. Obviously, we're thrilled with this result, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 16% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%; also a result of some discrete items and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16%, and up 15% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.1 billion, with capital expenditures of 1.6 billion and free cash flow of 11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago, due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was in fact up in constant currency, and it was a 2%. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of 5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of 19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now, to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now, currency though is extremely volatile, as you can see in what happened in this quarter, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive income effects on EPS for Q2. So, with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars and this because we will have slightly under 1% tailwind, so, in constant currency that kind of rounds into 0% to 2%, probably at the higher side. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind. So, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 cents and $1.02 in U.S. dollars. Now, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it, sometimes it's a little above it. However, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect to [normalizing] for these things, it'll average to 20%. So that's what I targeted in this guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thanks, Safra. Let's say, Oracle occupies a unique position in the Cloud markets. Oracle is the only Cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market SaaS, and the infrastructure as a service market IS, our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these two markets. It's a very interesting dynamic. I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the Cloud. Well, analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications number one in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time. We're number one in customer satisfaction in HCM. We're number one in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's Cloud infrastructure as a service business. I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020, Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM, and Google. Oracle IaaS, OCI received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveyed said, they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you, and many of our competitors. Just as Zoom picking Oracle Infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past. I know the biggest question for investors has been, can Oracle preserve its huge market leading database franchise into this new Cloud era? Well, interesting question. Obviously an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle, but if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI is in fact as IDC describes the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction. And that same IaaS, OCI is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database. Where do you think the Oracle Database installed base is going to go? What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle public cloud the only place you could get the autonomous database and Oracle Cloud@Customer, excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reason; much better security, much better reliability, much better performance, and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are and I'll talk about the people like 8x8 are another video conferencing system are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle that moving to the Oracle Cloud. Zoom is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI and Zoom\u2019s results. Zoom\u2019s recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company named become a verb. At Oracle, we love the Zoom, as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom\u2019s usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple digit revenue growth in sequential quarters from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. OCI Cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions, and will be adding at least another 10 regions in the next nine months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle\u2019s Database Cloud@Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database in the public cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud@Customer, which is unique Oracle offering and they're going directly into our public cloud. So, the price is the same in both cases. The database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases. We're seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud@Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database, and the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. When in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today Oracle economists Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system. Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates [site downtime]. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure an Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do, you just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this economist reliability feature. Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region Gen 2 Cloud@Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen 2 public cloud behind their firewall, in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall. It's every service that's in our public cloud, compute storage fusion application, plus the economist database, the Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything, and we manage it, and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody, but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall. Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous Database revenue grew 64%, an annualized consumption. Our Gen 2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market. And we're taking market share in the process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please queue up the audience for questions. We'll go to Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you, and congratulations on the strong quarter and especially on license and margins. I'd like to ask about the guidance. Well, Q1 was strong while the economic destruction of COVID-19 is not yet over and get you guiding would look strongly, can you give us some more color on why you feel so confident? And specifically are you modeling to increase strength in database, SaaS ERP HCM, how big a factor is Gen 2 Cloud in the guidance? And the information would be appreciated. Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, it's really following the path that we were on before COVID really hit in March. And so, we were \u2013 what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So, the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the Cloud. And that so does have implications on license because options grew not only, database options grew not only double digits, but actually 20% something. And analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our Cloud. But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle specific hardware that's very strategic, you know, continues to do well, but really the [big barn theatres] are, the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now OCI, and our database cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger.  And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over a 100% and this kind of \u2013 this is now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses, I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster. And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then of course, you have the cases that Larry's talked about, where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Gen 2 is just so good, and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the cover and it\u2019s a very easy extrapolation, as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow.\nMark Moerdler: Excellent. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Next question please. Thank you, Erica.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks so much for taking the question. And I'll echo my congrats to the company as well. I want to ask about Cloud@Customer, clearly there's a lot of excitement for how it can enable very large customers to adopt autonomous database and have all the benefits of OCI behind the firewall, and I appreciate it's only really become available in the last few months, but maybe for Larry, from a product market fit perspective, can you explain why this is such a big deal? And for Safra, are there any leading indicators you can point to maybe backlog or anything else to help us understand the leading demand for these products, which I assume it supports your confidence in the overall business accelerating? Thanks.\nLarry Ellison: Yeah. I think I can explain it very clearly. So, we've been working on Oracle Autonomous Database for several years. As I mentioned, in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018, but if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So, the Oracle Autonomous Database was available on our public cloud and has been for three years and it keeps getting better and better, but if you're an on a big on-premise customer, you know, you didn't have the late access to our latest and greatest database.  It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our late technology was not available for the vast majority of our customers. All of a sudden, with Cloud@Customer with our Database Cloud@Customer at very low prices you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database. And have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think that growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version one, and I'll just, you know, full disclosure, we had a version one of this, that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version two is kind of the extreme opposite we learned a lot. And version two is, you know really plug and play, goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use incredibly reliable and we're seeing \u2013 and we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth or, you know, Oracle Database Cloud@Customer, and the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's two ways; people are going to make the choice to upgrade or \u2013 and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once with Autonomous Database they're not going anywhere.\nKen Bond : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you so much to the two of you. I just thought Safra, OCI had a great quarter, and obviously, it had really impressive growth with customers like Zoom that you've highlighted, and can you talk to us a little bit about the pipeline momentum you're seeing with OCI as customers accelerate their migrations to the Cloud? And also, can you share with us what type of workloads and applications are seeing the most traction with it or is it really broad based? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Okay, let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves all custom things, they're on the Oracle database. They\u2019re going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen 2, which is powerful enough, secure enough, and capable enough for their crown jewels, and they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future because often they want to do what we call BYOL, Bring Your Own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads. Now, it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communication industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high performance applications that run on Oracle they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it in the public Cloud, many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others are doing Cloud@Customer. And this second generation of Cloud@Customers now with Autonomous Database is just so powerful for our customers. So, we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications, and then there are applications that otherwise just run as some of the competing Cloud services that when they do just like Zoom did, [but] 8X8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network a lot of compute. May use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, you know, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performance, and since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack. And it's really very, very, very broad based for us. I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about \u2013 add some more to that.\nLarry Ellison: Yeah, I\u2019ll add a little bit of color. When Safra says our customers waiting for us, let me add a little more information. A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle at AWS. That\u2019s right. It just didn't work very well. So, they\u2019ve decided, maybe they should wait, and so they did. So, they did try. They looked around. They experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata Cloud Service, we have, you know, autonomous database is not available anyplace, but the Oracle Cloud Exadata database service isn't available anyplace to the Oracle Cloud. We're much better \u2013 you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle Applications than anybody else than we are, and a significant percentage of enterprise applications. You know, I don't know 40%, 30%, 40% are Oracle Applications. So, that's just a gigantic installed base that we think it's going to be moving to the Oracle. We're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. So that's one thing. So they tried, didn't work. So, they're coming to us. Next thing. A lot of our application customers, you know, we got well over 7,000 customers \u2013 Fusion application customer, 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data, everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle Infrastructure Services. As I said, the Oracle Analytic Cloud is an Oracle Infrastructure Service, is an OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So, our application customers pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become in the not too distant future, will become infrastructure customers, a lot again, and you've got to add them onto. So, these are people that our SAS customers are going to become infrastructure customers. On premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud@Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are surprises like Zoom, you know, and 8x8, but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performance, and economical. They pick \u2013 because it has nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them doing a SaaS customer that was just purely an evaluation of our Cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon. And another example of that is high performance computing. Car companies simulating crashes. Now, why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high performance computing when you can go to Google, or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore much of it \u2013 we\u2019re much, much faster and therefore they get the simulations on faster, but they got to be willing to pay less. Yeah, almost every car company, well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high performance computing or evaluating our high performance computing because we benchmarked so well, against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business. So, the OCI team did a spectacular job of building, you know, a second generation learning from what Microsoft did? What Google did? What Amazon did? And then building the next generation, and it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So, and again, and these are very early days. Gen 2 OCI is relatively new. And, Gen 2 Cloud@Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years.\nHeather Bellini : Thank you very much.\nKen Bond: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, congrats from me as well. Originally, I wanted to ask about the Enterprise Edition of TikTok, but you said, I shouldn't ask about TikTok, so different question, though. The \u2013 would you maybe discuss, like we talked about the strength in Cloud, but the other thing that stood out this quarter was how much better you did compared to your peers on the license side. You know, you were up where everyone kind of was down quite significantly, and you touched on some of the drivers, but maybe you could double a click on some of that again, because that stands really out as something that we haven't seen in the industry. Thank you. \nLarry Ellison : I'd like to comment on that, because I think our licensed business is really misunderstood. People think are license \u2013 they see licensed business, and they translate in their brain license means on-premise. That is not true for us. It may be true for everybody else, by the way, probably is true for everybody else, but it's not true for us. We have this thing called bring your own license to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses, buy more licenses and our pitch is, you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the Cloud and get big discounts running database in the Cloud. So, you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old \u2013 revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people we have, when we see [indiscernible] and these big these big contracts for database. The reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them not all of them, but a lot \u2013 majority of them is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our public Cloud to Cloud@Customer and getting big discounts. Getting, you know getting a benefit. Getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So, again, don't translate license to mean not Cloud. A lot of the license is in fact, Cloud, as well as [on premise].\nSafra Catz: Right. It\u2019s driven. In fact, it's driven by their plan to move to the Cloud. And that is very, very clear because they're buying the specific option, which as I said, the options number, very high percentage growth this quarter, because it's really in preparation for their move to the Cloud. But I will also tell you that is available also in analytics and in some of the other some of the other techniques, you know technology licenses. So, analytics is very strong. The database options is extremely strong, very much pointing in the direction of moving to the cloud. So that's really what is driving it. It's not \u2013 it's generally not going to be staying on-premise. Some of course, stays on-premise and some will stay on-premise indefinitely, but many companies will be either hybrid, or will be Cloud@Customer, or of course in the public cloud. And that's really what's going on here. And it's, it's really quite clear.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Very clear. Congrats again.\nSafra Catz: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company.\nDerrick Wood: Right, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the hardware side of the business. This is the first quarter seen without negative growth in a long time and to see you heading 70% gross margin, pretty impressive and far sooner than what we've thought. So, does this tell us you're mostly through bleeding off the commodity pieces, and that the majority of growth is driven by Exadata and Cloud@Customer and how should we generally think about the directional trends from here both in terms of growth and margins?\nSafra Catz: Yes. So, the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata. Revenue in Exadata was up 15%. Bookings in our strategic hardware, also up very, very high double digit. And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog really the largest. It's actually double what it was, more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strongly. It has now gotten large enough. And, you know, the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain. And, you know, that's taking a while to resolve itself, but we were able to make and shift a lot of Exadata\u2019s, but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating. And of course, what that points to is, a commitment by our customers to Oracle, you know, you don't find Exadata to run anything, but Oracle Database, application, you know, Database Systems. And that commitment to the Oracle Platform is really shown up in this area. Cloud@Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud@Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the Cloud line when they go online and they consume, and they consume credit. So, Cloud credit, so it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great start to the fiscal year. Just want to focus on applications. We haven't really talked about that a lot on this call. Obviously, you gave out some really strong numbers with Fusion Cloud, you know, Safra, you talked about some of the puts and takes in the overall business and I wonder if you could talk about those sort of applications specifically?\nSafra Catz: Sure. I mean, really, when you think of our application business, you really have to think about Fusion and especially Fusion ERP, HCM, our back office, you have to think about NetSuite those are the fastest growing segments. And you have to take into account that we have some other things in that business that are smaller, and some of them are from acquisitions. And that is the less, you know the less strategic part of our business. And as that gets smaller, sometimes replaced by Fusion, that's why that business is really doing very, very well. Because the ERP \u2013 everything is Fusion, but Fusion ERP HCM, this whole area really growing quickly. I mean, what you see is, many of our customers both E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft JD Edwards customers, but we also see a new phenomena, which is historically it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer to \u2013 but now we find that many of those doors are not only \u2013 can be basically are already open for us. So, as the only provider of ERP and the cloud for large, medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so, we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers, simply because they're really very frustrated with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So, this business for us is an enormous opportunity. And it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact.\nPhil Winslow: Great, thanks a lot. Keep up the good work.\nKen Bond : Thank you Safra, thank you Phil. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow up questions in this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks Ken and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask. So, now to Oracle's results, as you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. This quarter revenue was more than 150 million above the midpoint of guidance and EPS was [$0.70] above the mid. Currency helps a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side, and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in three years. As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our fusion fast momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of autonomous database, which will continue to get even better now that we have autonomous database available on Cloud@Customer. Our total Cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were 6.9 billion, up 2% from last year and accounted for 74% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues were 2.8 billion, up 4%, but our Fusion app were up 26% with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. On our Fusion retention rates, which are already high continue to go up. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were 4.1 billion, up to 1%, but with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous database consumption revenue was up 64% and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. Licensed revenues were 886 million, up 8%. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter were 9.4 billion, up 2%. As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was 4.2 billion and as I said, up 8% from last year and our best operating income growth in three years. Obviously, we're thrilled with this result, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 16% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%; also a result of some discrete items and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16%, and up 15% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.1 billion, with capital expenditures of 1.6 billion and free cash flow of 11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago, due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was in fact up in constant currency, and it was a 2%. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of 5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of 19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now, to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now, currency though is extremely volatile, as you can see in what happened in this quarter, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive income effects on EPS for Q2. So, with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars and this because we will have slightly under 1% tailwind, so, in constant currency that kind of rounds into 0% to 2%, probably at the higher side. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind. So, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 cents and $1.02 in U.S. dollars. Now, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it, sometimes it's a little above it. However, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect to [normalizing] for these things, it'll average to 20%. So that's what I targeted in this guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Sure. Thanks for the question. So, it's really following the path that we were on before COVID really hit in March. And so, we were \u2013 what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So, the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the Cloud. And that so does have implications on license because options grew not only, database options grew not only double digits, but actually 20% something. And analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our Cloud. But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle specific hardware that's very strategic, you know, continues to do well, but really the [big barn theatres] are, the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now OCI, and our database cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger.  And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over a 100% and this kind of \u2013 this is now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses, I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster. And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then of course, you have the cases that Larry's talked about, where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Gen 2 is just so good, and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the cover and it's a very easy extrapolation, as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow. Okay, let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves all custom things, they're on the Oracle database. They're going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen 2, which is powerful enough, secure enough, and capable enough for their crown jewels, and they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future because often they want to do what we call BYOL, Bring Your Own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads. Now, it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communication industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high performance applications that run on Oracle they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it in the public Cloud, many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others are doing Cloud@Customer. And this second generation of Cloud@Customers now with Autonomous Database is just so powerful for our customers. So, we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications, and then there are applications that otherwise just run as some of the competing Cloud services that when they do just like Zoom did, [but] 8X8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network a lot of compute. May use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, you know, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performance, and since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack. And it's really very, very, very broad based for us. I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about \u2013 add some more to that. Right. It's driven. In fact, it's driven by their plan to move to the Cloud. And that is very, very clear because they're buying the specific option, which as I said, the options number, very high percentage growth this quarter, because it's really in preparation for their move to the Cloud. But I will also tell you that is available also in analytics and in some of the other some of the other techniques, you know technology licenses. So, analytics is very strong. The database options is extremely strong, very much pointing in the direction of moving to the cloud. So that's really what is driving it. It's not \u2013 it's generally not going to be staying on-premise. Some of course, stays on-premise and some will stay on-premise indefinitely, but many companies will be either hybrid, or will be Cloud@Customer, or of course in the public cloud. And that's really what's going on here. And it's, it's really quite clear. Yeah, thank you. Yes. So, the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata. Revenue in Exadata was up 15%. Bookings in our strategic hardware, also up very, very high double digit. And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog really the largest. It's actually double what it was, more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strongly. It has now gotten large enough. And, you know, the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain. And, you know, that's taking a while to resolve itself, but we were able to make and shift a lot of Exadata's, but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating. And of course, what that points to is, a commitment by our customers to Oracle, you know, you don't find Exadata to run anything, but Oracle Database, application, you know, Database Systems. And that commitment to the Oracle Platform is really shown up in this area. Cloud@Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud@Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the Cloud line when they go online and they consume, and they consume credit. So, Cloud credit, so it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all. Sure. I mean, really, when you think of our application business, you really have to think about Fusion and especially Fusion ERP, HCM, our back office, you have to think about NetSuite those are the fastest growing segments. And you have to take into account that we have some other things in that business that are smaller, and some of them are from acquisitions. And that is the less, you know the less strategic part of our business. And as that gets smaller, sometimes replaced by Fusion, that's why that business is really doing very, very well. Because the ERP \u2013 everything is Fusion, but Fusion ERP HCM, this whole area really growing quickly. I mean, what you see is, many of our customers both E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft JD Edwards customers, but we also see a new phenomena, which is historically it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer to \u2013 but now we find that many of those doors are not only \u2013 can be basically are already open for us. So, as the only provider of ERP and the cloud for large, medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so, we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers, simply because they're really very frustrated with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So, this business for us is an enormous opportunity. And it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thanks, Safra. Let's say, Oracle occupies a unique position in the Cloud markets. Oracle is the only Cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market SaaS, and the infrastructure as a service market IS, our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these two markets. It's a very interesting dynamic. I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the Cloud. Well, analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications number one in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time. We're number one in customer satisfaction in HCM. We're number one in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's Cloud infrastructure as a service business. I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020, Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM, and Google. Oracle IaaS, OCI received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveyed said, they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you, and many of our competitors. Just as Zoom picking Oracle Infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past. I know the biggest question for investors has been, can Oracle preserve its huge market leading database franchise into this new Cloud era? Well, interesting question. Obviously an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle, but if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI is in fact as IDC describes the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction. And that same IaaS, OCI is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database. Where do you think the Oracle Database installed base is going to go? What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle public cloud the only place you could get the autonomous database and Oracle Cloud@Customer, excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reason; much better security, much better reliability, much better performance, and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are and I'll talk about the people like 8x8 are another video conferencing system are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle that moving to the Oracle Cloud. Zoom is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI and Zoom's results. Zoom's recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company named become a verb. At Oracle, we love the Zoom, as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom's usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple digit revenue growth in sequential quarters from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. OCI Cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions, and will be adding at least another 10 regions in the next nine months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle's Database Cloud@Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database in the public cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud@Customer, which is unique Oracle offering and they're going directly into our public cloud. So, the price is the same in both cases. The database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases. We're seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud@Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database, and the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. When in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today Oracle economists Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system. Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates [site downtime]. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure an Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do, you just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this economist reliability feature. Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region Gen 2 Cloud@Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen 2 public cloud behind their firewall, in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall. It's every service that's in our public cloud, compute storage fusion application, plus the economist database, the Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything, and we manage it, and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody, but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall. Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous Database revenue grew 64%, an annualized consumption. Our Gen 2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market. And we're taking market share in the process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken. Yeah. I think I can explain it very clearly. So, we've been working on Oracle Autonomous Database for several years. As I mentioned, in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018, but if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So, the Oracle Autonomous Database was available on our public cloud and has been for three years and it keeps getting better and better, but if you're an on a big on-premise customer, you know, you didn't have the late access to our latest and greatest database.  It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our late technology was not available for the vast majority of our customers. All of a sudden, with Cloud@Customer with our Database Cloud@Customer at very low prices you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database. And have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think that growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version one, and I'll just, you know, full disclosure, we had a version one of this, that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version two is kind of the extreme opposite we learned a lot. And version two is, you know really plug and play, goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use incredibly reliable and we're seeing \u2013 and we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth or, you know, Oracle Database Cloud@Customer, and the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's two ways; people are going to make the choice to upgrade or \u2013 and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once with Autonomous Database they're not going anywhere. Yeah, I'll add a little bit of color. When Safra says our customers waiting for us, let me add a little more information. A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle at AWS. That's right. It just didn't work very well. So, they've decided, maybe they should wait, and so they did. So, they did try. They looked around. They experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata Cloud Service, we have, you know, autonomous database is not available anyplace, but the Oracle Cloud Exadata database service isn't available anyplace to the Oracle Cloud. We're much better \u2013 you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle Applications than anybody else than we are, and a significant percentage of enterprise applications. You know, I don't know 40%, 30%, 40% are Oracle Applications. So, that's just a gigantic installed base that we think it's going to be moving to the Oracle. We're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. So that's one thing. So they tried, didn't work. So, they're coming to us. Next thing. A lot of our application customers, you know, we got well over 7,000 customers \u2013 Fusion application customer, 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data, everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle Infrastructure Services. As I said, the Oracle Analytic Cloud is an Oracle Infrastructure Service, is an OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So, our application customers pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become in the not too distant future, will become infrastructure customers, a lot again, and you've got to add them onto. So, these are people that our SAS customers are going to become infrastructure customers. On premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud@Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are surprises like Zoom, you know, and 8x8, but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performance, and economical. They pick \u2013 because it has nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them doing a SaaS customer that was just purely an evaluation of our Cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon. And another example of that is high performance computing. Car companies simulating crashes. Now, why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high performance computing when you can go to Google, or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore much of it \u2013 we're much, much faster and therefore they get the simulations on faster, but they got to be willing to pay less. Yeah, almost every car company, well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high performance computing or evaluating our high performance computing because we benchmarked so well, against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business. So, the OCI team did a spectacular job of building, you know, a second generation learning from what Microsoft did? What Google did? What Amazon did? And then building the next generation, and it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So, and again, and these are very early days. Gen 2 OCI is relatively new. And, Gen 2 Cloud@Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years. I'd like to comment on that, because I think our licensed business is really misunderstood. People think are license \u2013 they see licensed business, and they translate in their brain license means on-premise. That is not true for us. It may be true for everybody else, by the way, probably is true for everybody else, but it's not true for us. We have this thing called bring your own license to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses, buy more licenses and our pitch is, you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the Cloud and get big discounts running database in the Cloud. So, you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old \u2013 revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people we have, when we see [indiscernible] and these big these big contracts for database. The reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them not all of them, but a lot \u2013 majority of them is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our public Cloud to Cloud@Customer and getting big discounts. Getting, you know getting a benefit. Getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So, again, don't translate license to mean not Cloud. A lot of the license is in fact, Cloud, as well as [on premise]."

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter across the board with total revenue growing 10% in constant currency, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2011, and $240 million above the high end of my constant currency guidance. Earnings were equally strong as the EPS was $0.20 above the high end of guidance. What Q4 demonstrates is that our business is accelerating. A growing list of customers, many new to Oracle are choosing us for more products and services as they understand the benefits of Oracle technology. Our technology helps make our customers modern, efficient and more productive. And they got to see that during the pandemic, and now it's very clear. Those customers are then becoming larger Oracle customers. Fusion customers are buying OCI. OCI customers are buying Fusion and NetSuite. Database customers are moving to autonomous on OCI. Industry vertical customers are going all in on Fusion. We have real momentum all around. Going forward and despite the macro environment, we continue to expect the revenue growth in our cloud business will accelerate substantially in fiscal year '23. We are also excited about completing the Cerner acquisition. Larry spoke at our Oracle Health Strategy session last week, and he'll give you more details today, and I'll fill in with some numbers. As you can see in the financial statements, the currency headwind this past quarter was 5%, which was considerably higher than the 2% to 3%, it was during our last earnings call. Following my regular custom, I'll be reviewing our non-GAAP USD results using constant currency growth rates so you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now for Q4, total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, up 7% in constant currency again, driven by Fusion, NetSuite, autonomous database and, of course, Gen 2 OCI. Total cloud revenues, that's IaaS plus SaaS was USD 2.5 billion, up 22% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues were $3.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.4 billion and grew 24% in constant currency this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 23% and NetSuite ERP up 30%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% in constant currency. Infrastructure, cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $3.2 billion, and excluding our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 49%, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 83%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 108% and autonomous database, which was up 29%. License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency led by database sales for use in the cloud by major application cloud SaaS companies. As a result our database business had an exceptional quarter with total database revenue up double digits. So all in, total revenue for the quarter were $11.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 11% as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. For the quarter, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 82% and the gross profit dollars grew 4%. The full year growth of this gross profit was 4% higher than the 2% we saw last year, and I expect it will be significantly higher in FY '23. Though we will continue to invest in growth, we should benefit from economies of scale of running our cloud business as it gets larger. You should keep in mind that our fundamental principle going forward is to grow non-GAAP EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%, once again higher than all of our competitors. And even while we've been investing aggressively for growth, we've maintained our financial discipline. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.1 and below our base tax rate of 19% as we received a benefit from the resolution of some tax matters in Q4. EPS was $1.54 in U.S. dollars, up 7% in constant currency, unchanged in USD. GAAP EPS was $1.16, down 8% in constant currency, down 15% in USD. Now for the -- let me go through the full fiscal year, though I've given you some full year numbers so far every once in a while. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were $42.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency and our highest annual growth rate in more than 10 years. Total applications revenue grew 8% compared to 5% last year, and total infrastructure revenue grew 7% compared to 2% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth accelerated this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the year was $30.2 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services were up 22% to $10.8 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was 4.9 -- was USD 4.90, up 5% in USD, up 8% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 46%, up 2% from pre-pandemic levels and down a little bit -- down 1% from last year. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $9.5 billion, and free cash flow was $5 billion with capital expenditures of $4.5 billion during the year. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $4 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. At quarter end, we had nearly $22 billion in cash and marketable securities, but that's lower now that Cerner has closed. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.4 billion, up slightly in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $46.6 billion, up 17% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 57% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for a total of $600 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. With the completion of the Cerner acquisition, which happened after the end of Q4, actually, this last week, we've added about $15.8 billion of debt. And we anticipate retaining our investment-grade credit rating, meaning that for the time being, we're going to focus on reducing our debt balance while continuing our share repurchases at current levels. In addition, I don't believe the dividend will be impacted at all. Once the debt level has declined, we'll reexamine share repurchase levels. Now to the guidance. We feel very optimistic about our business momentum. And we also recognize that there is increasing macro uncertainty right now. In addition, since we ceased operations in Russia in March and made other adjustments in the region, we have factored out around $100 million per quarter from guidance that we used to receive from these customers. Taking all that into account, I do expect our cloud business, which grew 22% this year, will organically grow more than 30% in constant currency in FY '23. Cloud service and license support will also see growth acceleration and could well see double-digit organic growth. As I said earlier, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Given our increasing confidence in organic revenue growth, we will continue to prudently invest back in the business and you can already see the returns in our performance. Revenue growth accelerated from 2% in FY '21 to 7% this year. Clearly, there's strong demand for our cloud services, and we intend to capitalize it -- to capitalize on it. As such, I expect our CapEx spend will be higher in FY '23 to meet the demand. We expect to add another 6 regions in fiscal 2023 in addition to the 38 cloud regions across 20 countries that we have already serving our customers. I also want to share how we will be running Cerner since it will impact their contribution to Oracle going forward. We are already working actively to build and implement world-class health care cloud capabilities. Larry will go over that. This means that we are reviewing their entire product portfolio to identify areas where we can include Oracle technology rather than third-party products as well as moving them to OCI. These efforts will deliver a more stable, secure and innovative product portfolio for customers while using less third-party products. We remain confident in our ability to grow Cerner's top line and bottom line faster than they were able to do so on their own as these changes are implemented. Now let me turn to my guidance. I'll review Q1 on a non-GAAP basis and if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 3% to 4% negative impact on total revenue and maybe $0.05 to $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 20% to 22% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 17% to 19% in USD at today's exchange rate. As with past acquisitions, have added conservatism for the Cerner revenue contribution to account for the transition. For Q1, cloud -- total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 25% to 28% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 22% to 25% in USD. As I mentioned above, for fiscal year 2023, total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow over 30% in constant currency. Total cloud growth in Q1, including Cerner is expected to grow from 47% to 50% in constant currency, 44% to 47% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% to 10% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.04 and $1.08 in USD. And as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q1. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. As Safra said, our plan is to accelerate cloud revenue growth, while continuing to grow earnings per share. First, let me provide some detail on how we plan to accelerate cloud revenue growth. It all starts with our two most important verticals: health care and financial services. In health care, we\u2019re in the process of building a complete suite of applications for the entire health care ecosystem, starting with health care providers like hospitals and clinics. We\u2019re modernizing Cerner\u2019s clinical systems by adding capabilities like a voice user interface and applications like disease-specific AI models for cancer and other diseases. We\u2019re including an IoT device network to improve patient diagnostics and monitoring. We\u2019re adding administrative systems, including managing the incredibly complex contract workforce that hospitals have as doctors are not bolt-on employees nor are nurses. We are going to help recruiting, scheduling and paying those contract workers according to their contracts. Inventory at hospitals is enormously complicated. Inventories aren\u2019t in a central location. You find inventory in nurse\u2019s stations outside operating rooms, outside the intensive care unit. There\u2019s inventory everywhere. Managing that inventory is very complicated. We\u2019re adding RFID tags and maps on handheld phones to help people find what they\u2019re looking for quickly. For payers, including insurance companies and governments, we\u2019re automating payment authorization and billing systems. For pharmaceutical companies, we\u2019re integrating our clinical trial system directly into the hospital clinical system, making clinical trials easier to start and faster to complete. We can do all of this and more because we\u2019re building these health care applications using the latest most productive technologies in the cloud, namely, the Oracle Autonomous Database and the APEX low code programming language. Using these tools, security and reliability are built into the technology platform, not the application. In our financial services vertical, we\u2019re working with major money center banks and leading logistics companies to automate B2B commerce from directly within the Oracle ERP Cloud. For example, when a hospital wants to buy an X-ray machine, that hospital simply enters a purchase request for the X-ray machine into their Oracle ERP procurement system. That procurement system then sends that order directly to the selling company\u2019s Oracle ERP order management system and automatically originates a corresponding loan request from that hospital\u2019s preferred bank. The company selling the X-ray machine uses their Oracle ERP order management system to check product availability and submit a shipping request to their preferred logistics provider to automatically quote a delivery date to the buyer. The entire B2B commerce process is automated within the Oracle Cloud. Purchasing, selling, loan origination, shipping, billing and payments. Automating B2B commerce is yet another huge opportunity for Oracle. We already have over 30,000 Cloud ERP customers, including many of the world\u2019s most important banks and leading logistics companies. Let\u2019s take a moment to look at the progress we continue to make in our Oracle ERP Cloud, starting with health care. We\u2019ve got a very strong position in health care with the providers, including Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, Northwell Health, Tenet, HCM Health, Highmark Health, Humana, Cigna and many others. In Q4, we closed United Healthcare, a win over SAP. We won the NHS, the UK\u2019s second major move to the Cloud. We won New South Wales Ministry of Health in Australia for ERP and SCM. We won WellSpan, a regional provider in Pennsylvania with eight hospitals. We won Abcam, a UK life sciences company, increasing their footprint in ERP and SCM. Going live in Q4 were the Cleveland Clinic with ERP and SCM, UC Health for ERP and SCM, Pfizer on enterprise performance management, UK Health went live, Atrium Health went live, all in Q4. In financial services, our other really big vertical, we had, as I said earlier, we have a very strong position with the money center banks with ERP. Bank of America uses Fusion applications. JPMorgan Chase uses Fusion applications. So does Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Credit Agricole, SMFB, TD Bank, Societe Generale, Vanguard, State Street. I can go on and on, but let me go to the results in Q4. In Q4, we won at Citibank a big ERP win against SAP. We won at Chubb. We won at PNC, the sixth largest bank in the United States. We won at SMBC, the largest Japanese-owned bank in the United States. We won Oversea China Banking Corp. We won Mizuho, the third largest bank in Japan. TIAA, Desjardins, Mitsui Sumitomo also in Japan. GMP, one of Mexico\u2019s largest financial services company. We have a very, very strong position in financial services. That\u2019s one of the key groups of partners that we\u2019re working to automate B2B commerce, along with the logistics companies. In retail, we won, well, we already had Kohl\u2019s, Office Depot, Macy\u2019s, Kroger\u2019s, Albertson\u2019s, Petco, McDonald\u2019s, Chipotle, Tiffany, Sachs, Williams-Sonoma, Walmart, CVS, but in Q4, we added to that list. We added Lowe\u2019s and Albertson\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams and Abercrombie & Fitch. We had major go-lives at Macy\u2019s, Next Doors, and the Co-op Stores, all in retail. In communications, where we\u2019re already present at AT&T, Orange, MTN, Bharti Airtel, Rogers, Wind Tre, Telecom Italia, KPN and SEC, we won Virgin Media. We had a major expansion at AT&T, an ERP SCM expansion. We won a major expansion ERP and EPM at Verizon. Very, very strong quarter in telecommunications with a huge go-live at KPN, the Dutch telecom company, in ERP and SCM. Service wins, we already have PwC, KPMG, Booz Allen, True Blue, Securitas, Waste Management, Skanska, McDermott-Jacobs. We won in Q4 BDO, Verisk Analytics and the Mudafalo Group. Go-lives in Q4 in services included Pricewaterhouse, Manpower Group, TriNet and Republic Services. In the public sector, we had a major win at the State of Missouri, wall-to-wall at the State of Missouri, ERP, SCM, HCM. That was a win over Workday, SAP and everybody else. We won at the Scottish Government. We won at the UK Home Office. We won a State of Switzerland, Vaud. We won General Organization for Social Insurance in Saudi Arabia. We won a deal with the police department in the State of Victoria in Australia. We had major go-lives in public sector in the City of St. Louis and Norfolk County, UK. In hospitality, where we already have Marriott, Hilton, Caesar\u2019s, MGM, Lowes, Royal Caribbean and Park Hotels, we added Airbnb for ERP expansion, a win over Workday, and Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts. Logistics, again, this is our other big group of partners in our major effort to automate B2B commerce from within the Oracle ERP Cloud. We have a very strong position globally in logistics. Our customers include UPS, FedEx, DHL, Swift, Schneider, Union Pacific, Yellow. We added An Post, the postal service of Ireland. The go-lives included DHL, UPS and Deutsche Post. In higher ed, where we\u2019re already installed at Princeton, Cambridge, Julliard, Vanderbilt, UCLA, University of Chicago, Edenborough, Rutgers, Baylor, UCSD and lots and lots of others, we added the University of Maine, East Tennessee State, Villanova and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Other notable wins in the quarter, on high-tech, we won Teradata. We won a big win at Toyota Motor, an ERP win. At Denso, again, let\u2019s see, what else we got. Berry Global, let\u2019s see, AP Team was another ERP win in energies. Okay. So it was a very, very strong quarter. We\u2019re very excited about our momentum in ERP and how we can expand ERP from what it was when it was an on-premise system to what it can be in terms of B2B commerce automation now that it\u2019s a cloud system. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. David, if you please poll the audience for questions, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much and congratulations on the double-digit growth in the quarter. So Larry, your vision of a national health record database is very compelling. It would be a profound benefit to society. Just considering that several trillion dollars are spent on healthcare, what do you see as the size of the opportunity for Oracle and Cerner if you solve that particular problem?\nLawrence Ellison: Well, the national health records database solves 2 problems, and it allows patients in the case of an emergency to have their caregivers get immediate access to all of their health records, which will deliver way better outcomes for people. The other is public health officials will get much better information about the state of health in their country. So I mean, the amount of -- having this knowledge, it's -- we dramatically improved healthcare but we also save an enormous amount of money by doing that. I don't know if you remember when we sent that hospital [shipped] (ph) in New York City because the officials in New York thought they were about to run out of the hospital beds. It turns out they were wrong. We didn't run out of hospital beds, but they didn't know. They don't have -- public health officials don't have access to that kind of information. They're a bit flying -- it was very clear there are -- in a lot of cases, they were flying blind during the pandemic. By providing this information, we save a lot of lives and we save a lot of money. The scale of the opportunity is gigantic because it's not -- people think of it as a national opportunity. It's a global opportunity. Every country -- I mean, if you look at Western Europe, the Western Europe budgets are dominated by health care. If they can save lives and save money by putting in modern information systems, they'll do it and they'll do it quickly. It's clearly going to be our largest business.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Congratulations on a really solid quarter. So Safra, you mentioned on the conference call that you guys are putting up this type of result even on the backdrop, that's not the most stable kind of macro backdrop. And we're seeing a lot of other software companies seeing slipped deals, seeing issues with the consumer, Internet companies lowering their spend. You guys seem to be working through this very well. Can you give us some color into how you're doing it? Is it better execution? Is the Oracle value proposition going through more clearly? Can you help us understand where you're able to put up a bigger beat when a lot of guys are working with skinnier beat if at all during this period?\nSafra Catz : Okay. Well, first of all, you have to understand, we're a very big company. We have thousands -- hundreds of thousands of existing customers. Our products also are so compelling that often customers save money by moving to OCI. They -- also many of our customers realized during the pandemic that they absolutely had to have modern systems. Those companies that didn't have modern systems fairly survived through the pandemic. They have to have a digital connection with their customers, with their employees, with their suppliers. Those are the kinds of products we have. And when customers move, let's say, from Amazon to us, the moment they try us, they realize, whoa, this is better and more economical. And of course, for Oracle workloads, you can't get anywhere close to what we can do. So we have a lot of things working in our favor. Our products, of course, our Fusion products are superb. I mean we have so many customers. This call is not long enough to reach them. And of course, NetSuite is, again, industry-leading like Fusion for a different part of the market, incredible momentum. And now we -- by the way, as I mentioned, there's about $100 million a quarter that is just the Russia, Ukraine region, that we stopped charging our customers in Ukraine when they were invaded even though we continue to help them. And of course, we suspended everything in Russia. So we just are just trying to meet our customers' needs. The biggest issue is having enough to meet demand. And I'm actually very happy with the way we manage the supply chain this past quarter, and I'm hoping that it will be -- it will continue to get better because that will give us more capacity and more capability to deliver to our customers. So I mean, we just have so much momentum. We have so many happy customers. And they're just -- new customers are just buying more. You get into the cycle that's very virtuous and people really build confidence in our capability to execute and also the overall economic message and offering that we're giving, We've always tried to give a compelling financial offering. And I think that's really resonating in these times.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats on the great results. Larry, we picked up a meaningful uptick in the number of large enterprise agreements or ULAs that customers are doing with Oracle. And in particular, to satisfy their database needs, both on-premise and also in the cloud. Do you have any telemetry or other insights into customer behavior to see where they're deploying these licenses? And can you talk about why BYOL is so important to your strategy and the longevity of Oracle database? And maybe just for Safra as well, that license number was so strong. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned license growth was led by database use in the cloud by major app cloud SaaS companies. Just wondering if there's any more color you can provide there.\nLawrence Ellison : Yes. With the exception of Workday, most of the big application companies maybe conspicuously, salesforce.com is a very large Oracle user. And they license our database for use in their cloud. But they're not the only ones. There are a lot of SaaS companies that use our database in the cloud. And that keeps our license business very, very strong. Our database license business is very, very strong. We don't confuse a license for on-premise. Some licenses classically are used on-premise, but a lot of the new licenses that we're selling allow our customers to take those licenses and run them in the cloud, whether it's our cloud or other people's clouds or in the case of Salesforce in their own cloud. So it's -- the Oracle database is still the #1 database in the world by a significant margin. And it's the #1 database in the cloud when you start counting all of the SaaS companies that use the Oracle Database.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Congratulations on the strong quarter and the very positive commentary and guidance. I'd like to drill a little more on this question of people's concerns. With the increasing concerns of recession by many, can you tell me what you're seeing for the apps part of the business and more specifically for ERP? What I'm trying to understand is how will the shift in ERP to the cloud be impacted by any economic slowdown or won't it be? How should we think about that?\nLawrence Ellison : Well, I'm not sure I call it -- I'm sorry, Safra, Pease go ahead.\nSafra Catz : No. You go ahead, Larry. You go ahead.\nLawrence Ellison : Yes. Okay. I'm not sure I'd call it countercyclical, but the cloud systems cost a lot less than the on-premise systems to run. So -- and they give you much better information. They allow you to control expenses better. They don't cost that much to implement because you pay for them over time. So we -- what we're seeing is a -- let's take a look at NetSuite, which is the low end of the market, and you think those would be the companies to be most affected by the recession. It's not JPMorgan Chase. They'll keep building -- they'll keep putting in new systems. But some smaller entrepreneur-led companies, you think that the recession we got them. They had -- we got the most revenue we ever got from NetSuite this past quarter. and the highest growth rate that we've ever gotten from NetSuite this past quarter. They are accelerating into the recession because we think the benefits are enormous and it equips the companies to compete more effectively. And again, we don't see that business slowing down. Quite the contrary, we see our ERP business both Fusion and NetSuite accelerating. This in spite of the macroeconomic situation. Safra?\nSafra Catz : Yes. I think people don't realize how exorbitantly expensive it is to run those large SAP systems. They have data centers associated with them. They have hundreds, sometimes thousands of technicians to run them. They're old, they're clunky and moving to Fusion ERP. It's just a totally different world and costs So - the costs are tiny in comparison. I think people sort of forget that. And this applies really to all on-premise systems, but even more so to those old SAP systems. And our cloud offering in that area really is unrivaled. Frankly, unrivaled. And we -- our win rates just continue. And we're very optimistic about it, and we've sold a lot. A lot is still being implemented, and we expect that you'll see that in the numbers, while our customers end up spending less than what they use to spend with on-premise.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Last quarter, Safra, you expected organic revenue growth to reach double digits next fiscal year. And so congratulations on reaching that double-digit milestone this quarter. Now within today's results, 2 numbers really stood out to us. First was the upside to license revenue. And then second was your commentary about total database revenue growing in the double digits. So my question is, Safra, Larry, can you give us more color on what's driving that reacceleration in license revenue in particular? Even as cloud revenue inflected to its highest growth rate in more than 4 years, is this BYOL bringing the heat? Is this autonomous database getting big enough and growing fast enough to lift the overall number, et cetera. And is this the broad-based demand that you mentioned on the Q3 call? Or is this more big deal driven?\nSafra Catz : So it's a little of both. You see, first of all, large enterprises understand that having an unlimited agreement for some period of time, an unlimited agreement gives them unbelievable flexibility. Any large customer, large database user that does not have an unlimited agreement with us is really not optimizing for their spend because it gives them incredible flexibility. They can use on-premise for as long as they need it. They can move to the cloud and get a much lower price in the cloud with BYOL, and they can move back and forth. And it just gives us the kind of flexibility. Those agreements are the ultimate sort of the foundation of so much of what goes on. In addition, of course, in technology, we also have our leading Java business, which on-premise is an extensive use and in the cloud is at no charge. So customers can be motivated to bring their Java to the Oracle Cloud and to use it at no charge, their Java program and to use it at no charge. So we have a lot of things that incent bringing your Oracle databases to our cloud and, of course, all your Java work to our cloud. So both of those are absolutely critical for our license numbers to be as strong as they are. And the Oracle database, I've been following Oracle for, well, since the '80s. And I always -- we always hear about some new product that's about to overtake Oracle. And the reality is that the Oracle database is beyond the gold standard. If you really need work done and if you want to protect your most critical data and you want to use large amounts of it, it is going to be the Oracle database that is head and shoulders above every other product. And invariably, some folks try other things when they get bigger, they always come back to the Oracle database It is irreplaceable because of its technical capabilities that are so far superior. And that becomes very, very, very clear to customers and more and more of them license -- continue their license and extend those unlimited agreements, whether for on-premise and in the cloud. It's not either or it's both, and that is the best use of it.\nLawrence Ellison: I'll add 1 thing to that, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database is interesting because it's autonomous. In other words, it doesn't require human beings to run it like database administrators, things like that. Recently, inside of Oracle, inside of our cloud, virtually every database going up for -- to run our cloud, the autonomous database because people don't want to hire database administrators inside of Oracle Corporation. It's just much cheaper to run. And I think in that sense, the Autonomous database is countercyclical. You do save a huge amount of money just by moving from conventional Oracle database to the autonomous database. It's actually more secure, more reliable and cost Wales to run. You don't need a bunch of experts running it. You don't need anyone to run it. There is a programming language called APEX, which uses -- it's a low code programming environment where you use 10% the name amount of programmers that you would use if you were programming in our other programming language called Java. And APEX is also becoming very popular inside of Oracle to build applications. I see this as 2 interesting trends as people using more modern technology to dramatically reduce their labor costs, which I think will play very well in the next couple of years in this economy.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. Safra, can you just give any additional color on the CapEx outlook for fiscal '23 relative to what we saw this year? And then just to clarify on the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. Is the pace of buyback that we saw this last quarter still reasonable for the near term, even with the incremental debt from Cerner?\nSafra Catz : Yes. So let me hit the buyback first because I know I gave you quite a word sandwich there at the end. I was losing steam. We bought back $600 million this past quarter. I think we bought back about $600 million the previous quarter. I expect to do about the same this quarter. Usually, I don't give you the number in advance. But since previous quarter, to those 2, we did $7 billion and a couple of $8 billion. We're not going to be at that level. We'll be at the $600 million for a few quarters until I see where our debt levels are. And so $600 million a quarter is probably what I'm targeting. It could be a little bit more potentially but that's kind of where I'm at. And then on CapEx, okay. So you noticed how I mentioned how many regions we have, we have just put out -- put up so many regions over the past 1.5 years or 2. I think we now have more than Amazon or we're in -- I think we do already have more than Amazon already. We are going to build another 6, and we're going to expand the ones that we have because they are being used so extensively. In many cases, they are spoken for. And so I expect CapEx, which was where it was this year. I think it will be a little bit more than what it was this year, next year. I'll be giving a little bit more detailed guidance as I see it playing out over the year. But we have so much -- I mean we have so much cloud demand that I am going to continue to spend in capital expenditure. But I do believe that as a percentage of our revenue growth. I think I'll start really feeling those economies of scale and increasing my gross margins and my operating margin significantly.\nKen Bond: A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thanks for joining today. With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter across the board with total revenue growing 10% in constant currency, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2011, and $240 million above the high end of my constant currency guidance. Earnings were equally strong as the EPS was $0.20 above the high end of guidance. What Q4 demonstrates is that our business is accelerating. A growing list of customers, many new to Oracle are choosing us for more products and services as they understand the benefits of Oracle technology. Our technology helps make our customers modern, efficient and more productive. And they got to see that during the pandemic, and now it's very clear. Those customers are then becoming larger Oracle customers. Fusion customers are buying OCI. OCI customers are buying Fusion and NetSuite. Database customers are moving to autonomous on OCI. Industry vertical customers are going all in on Fusion. We have real momentum all around. Going forward and despite the macro environment, we continue to expect the revenue growth in our cloud business will accelerate substantially in fiscal year '23. We are also excited about completing the Cerner acquisition. Larry spoke at our Oracle Health Strategy session last week, and he'll give you more details today, and I'll fill in with some numbers. As you can see in the financial statements, the currency headwind this past quarter was 5%, which was considerably higher than the 2% to 3%, it was during our last earnings call. Following my regular custom, I'll be reviewing our non-GAAP USD results using constant currency growth rates so you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now for Q4, total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, up 7% in constant currency again, driven by Fusion, NetSuite, autonomous database and, of course, Gen 2 OCI. Total cloud revenues, that's IaaS plus SaaS was USD 2.5 billion, up 22% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues were $3.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.4 billion and grew 24% in constant currency this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 23% and NetSuite ERP up 30%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% in constant currency. Infrastructure, cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $3.2 billion, and excluding our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 49%, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 83%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 108% and autonomous database, which was up 29%. License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency led by database sales for use in the cloud by major application cloud SaaS companies. As a result our database business had an exceptional quarter with total database revenue up double digits. So all in, total revenue for the quarter were $11.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 11% as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. For the quarter, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 82% and the gross profit dollars grew 4%. The full year growth of this gross profit was 4% higher than the 2% we saw last year, and I expect it will be significantly higher in FY '23. Though we will continue to invest in growth, we should benefit from economies of scale of running our cloud business as it gets larger. You should keep in mind that our fundamental principle going forward is to grow non-GAAP EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%, once again higher than all of our competitors. And even while we've been investing aggressively for growth, we've maintained our financial discipline. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.1 and below our base tax rate of 19% as we received a benefit from the resolution of some tax matters in Q4. EPS was $1.54 in U.S. dollars, up 7% in constant currency, unchanged in USD. GAAP EPS was $1.16, down 8% in constant currency, down 15% in USD. Now for the -- let me go through the full fiscal year, though I've given you some full year numbers so far every once in a while. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were $42.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency and our highest annual growth rate in more than 10 years. Total applications revenue grew 8% compared to 5% last year, and total infrastructure revenue grew 7% compared to 2% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth accelerated this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the year was $30.2 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services were up 22% to $10.8 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was 4.9 -- was USD 4.90, up 5% in USD, up 8% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 46%, up 2% from pre-pandemic levels and down a little bit -- down 1% from last year. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $9.5 billion, and free cash flow was $5 billion with capital expenditures of $4.5 billion during the year. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $4 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. At quarter end, we had nearly $22 billion in cash and marketable securities, but that's lower now that Cerner has closed. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.4 billion, up slightly in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $46.6 billion, up 17% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 57% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for a total of $600 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. With the completion of the Cerner acquisition, which happened after the end of Q4, actually, this last week, we've added about $15.8 billion of debt. And we anticipate retaining our investment-grade credit rating, meaning that for the time being, we're going to focus on reducing our debt balance while continuing our share repurchases at current levels. In addition, I don't believe the dividend will be impacted at all. Once the debt level has declined, we'll reexamine share repurchase levels. Now to the guidance. We feel very optimistic about our business momentum. And we also recognize that there is increasing macro uncertainty right now. In addition, since we ceased operations in Russia in March and made other adjustments in the region, we have factored out around $100 million per quarter from guidance that we used to receive from these customers. Taking all that into account, I do expect our cloud business, which grew 22% this year, will organically grow more than 30% in constant currency in FY '23. Cloud service and license support will also see growth acceleration and could well see double-digit organic growth. As I said earlier, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Given our increasing confidence in organic revenue growth, we will continue to prudently invest back in the business and you can already see the returns in our performance. Revenue growth accelerated from 2% in FY '21 to 7% this year. Clearly, there's strong demand for our cloud services, and we intend to capitalize it -- to capitalize on it. As such, I expect our CapEx spend will be higher in FY '23 to meet the demand. We expect to add another 6 regions in fiscal 2023 in addition to the 38 cloud regions across 20 countries that we have already serving our customers. I also want to share how we will be running Cerner since it will impact their contribution to Oracle going forward. We are already working actively to build and implement world-class health care cloud capabilities. Larry will go over that. This means that we are reviewing their entire product portfolio to identify areas where we can include Oracle technology rather than third-party products as well as moving them to OCI. These efforts will deliver a more stable, secure and innovative product portfolio for customers while using less third-party products. We remain confident in our ability to grow Cerner's top line and bottom line faster than they were able to do so on their own as these changes are implemented. Now let me turn to my guidance. I'll review Q1 on a non-GAAP basis and if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 3% to 4% negative impact on total revenue and maybe $0.05 to $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 20% to 22% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 17% to 19% in USD at today's exchange rate. As with past acquisitions, have added conservatism for the Cerner revenue contribution to account for the transition. For Q1, cloud -- total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 25% to 28% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 22% to 25% in USD. As I mentioned above, for fiscal year 2023, total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow over 30% in constant currency. Total cloud growth in Q1, including Cerner is expected to grow from 47% to 50% in constant currency, 44% to 47% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% to 10% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.04 and $1.08 in USD. And as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q1. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Okay. Well, first of all, you have to understand, we're a very big company. We have thousands -- hundreds of thousands of existing customers. Our products also are so compelling that often customers save money by moving to OCI. They -- also many of our customers realized during the pandemic that they absolutely had to have modern systems. Those companies that didn't have modern systems fairly survived through the pandemic. They have to have a digital connection with their customers, with their employees, with their suppliers. Those are the kinds of products we have. And when customers move, let's say, from Amazon to us, the moment they try us, they realize, whoa, this is better and more economical. And of course, for Oracle workloads, you can't get anywhere close to what we can do. So we have a lot of things working in our favor. Our products, of course, our Fusion products are superb. I mean we have so many customers. This call is not long enough to reach them. And of course, NetSuite is, again, industry-leading like Fusion for a different part of the market, incredible momentum. And now we -- by the way, as I mentioned, there's about $100 million a quarter that is just the Russia, Ukraine region, that we stopped charging our customers in Ukraine when they were invaded even though we continue to help them. And of course, we suspended everything in Russia. So we just are just trying to meet our customers' needs. The biggest issue is having enough to meet demand. And I'm actually very happy with the way we manage the supply chain this past quarter, and I'm hoping that it will be -- it will continue to get better because that will give us more capacity and more capability to deliver to our customers. So I mean, we just have so much momentum. We have so many happy customers. And they're just -- new customers are just buying more. You get into the cycle that's very virtuous and people really build confidence in our capability to execute and also the overall economic message and offering that we're giving, We've always tried to give a compelling financial offering. And I think that's really resonating in these times. No. You go ahead, Larry. You go ahead. Yes. I think people don't realize how exorbitantly expensive it is to run those large SAP systems. They have data centers associated with them. They have hundreds, sometimes thousands of technicians to run them. They're old, they're clunky and moving to Fusion ERP. It's just a totally different world and costs So - the costs are tiny in comparison. I think people sort of forget that. And this applies really to all on-premise systems, but even more so to those old SAP systems. And our cloud offering in that area really is unrivaled. Frankly, unrivaled. And we -- our win rates just continue. And we're very optimistic about it, and we've sold a lot. A lot is still being implemented, and we expect that you'll see that in the numbers, while our customers end up spending less than what they use to spend with on-premise. So it's a little of both. You see, first of all, large enterprises understand that having an unlimited agreement for some period of time, an unlimited agreement gives them unbelievable flexibility. Any large customer, large database user that does not have an unlimited agreement with us is really not optimizing for their spend because it gives them incredible flexibility. They can use on-premise for as long as they need it. They can move to the cloud and get a much lower price in the cloud with BYOL, and they can move back and forth. And it just gives us the kind of flexibility. Those agreements are the ultimate sort of the foundation of so much of what goes on. In addition, of course, in technology, we also have our leading Java business, which on-premise is an extensive use and in the cloud is at no charge. So customers can be motivated to bring their Java to the Oracle Cloud and to use it at no charge, their Java program and to use it at no charge. So we have a lot of things that incent bringing your Oracle databases to our cloud and, of course, all your Java work to our cloud. So both of those are absolutely critical for our license numbers to be as strong as they are. And the Oracle database, I've been following Oracle for, well, since the '80s. And I always -- we always hear about some new product that's about to overtake Oracle. And the reality is that the Oracle database is beyond the gold standard. If you really need work done and if you want to protect your most critical data and you want to use large amounts of it, it is going to be the Oracle database that is head and shoulders above every other product. And invariably, some folks try other things when they get bigger, they always come back to the Oracle database It is irreplaceable because of its technical capabilities that are so far superior. And that becomes very, very, very clear to customers and more and more of them license -- continue their license and extend those unlimited agreements, whether for on-premise and in the cloud. It's not either or it's both, and that is the best use of it. Yes. So let me hit the buyback first because I know I gave you quite a word sandwich there at the end. I was losing steam. We bought back $600 million this past quarter. I think we bought back about $600 million the previous quarter. I expect to do about the same this quarter. Usually, I don't give you the number in advance. But since previous quarter, to those 2, we did $7 billion and a couple of $8 billion. We're not going to be at that level. We'll be at the $600 million for a few quarters until I see where our debt levels are. And so $600 million a quarter is probably what I'm targeting. It could be a little bit more potentially but that's kind of where I'm at. And then on CapEx, okay. So you noticed how I mentioned how many regions we have, we have just put out -- put up so many regions over the past 1.5 years or 2. I think we now have more than Amazon or we're in -- I think we do already have more than Amazon already. We are going to build another 6, and we're going to expand the ones that we have because they are being used so extensively. In many cases, they are spoken for. And so I expect CapEx, which was where it was this year. I think it will be a little bit more than what it was this year, next year. I'll be giving a little bit more detailed guidance as I see it playing out over the year. But we have so much -- I mean we have so much cloud demand that I am going to continue to spend in capital expenditure. But I do believe that as a percentage of our revenue growth. I think I'll start really feeling those economies of scale and increasing my gross margins and my operating margin significantly."

            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. As Safra said, our plan is to accelerate cloud revenue growth, while continuing to grow earnings per share. First, let me provide some detail on how we plan to accelerate cloud revenue growth. It all starts with our two most important verticals: health care and financial services. In health care, we're in the process of building a complete suite of applications for the entire health care ecosystem, starting with health care providers like hospitals and clinics. We're modernizing Cerner's clinical systems by adding capabilities like a voice user interface and applications like disease-specific AI models for cancer and other diseases. We're including an IoT device network to improve patient diagnostics and monitoring. We're adding administrative systems, including managing the incredibly complex contract workforce that hospitals have as doctors are not bolt-on employees nor are nurses. We are going to help recruiting, scheduling and paying those contract workers according to their contracts. Inventory at hospitals is enormously complicated. Inventories aren't in a central location. You find inventory in nurse's stations outside operating rooms, outside the intensive care unit. There's inventory everywhere. Managing that inventory is very complicated. We're adding RFID tags and maps on handheld phones to help people find what they're looking for quickly. For payers, including insurance companies and governments, we're automating payment authorization and billing systems. For pharmaceutical companies, we're integrating our clinical trial system directly into the hospital clinical system, making clinical trials easier to start and faster to complete. We can do all of this and more because we're building these health care applications using the latest most productive technologies in the cloud, namely, the Oracle Autonomous Database and the APEX low code programming language. Using these tools, security and reliability are built into the technology platform, not the application. In our financial services vertical, we're working with major money center banks and leading logistics companies to automate B2B commerce from directly within the Oracle ERP Cloud. For example, when a hospital wants to buy an X-ray machine, that hospital simply enters a purchase request for the X-ray machine into their Oracle ERP procurement system. That procurement system then sends that order directly to the selling company's Oracle ERP order management system and automatically originates a corresponding loan request from that hospital's preferred bank. The company selling the X-ray machine uses their Oracle ERP order management system to check product availability and submit a shipping request to their preferred logistics provider to automatically quote a delivery date to the buyer. The entire B2B commerce process is automated within the Oracle Cloud. Purchasing, selling, loan origination, shipping, billing and payments. Automating B2B commerce is yet another huge opportunity for Oracle. We already have over 30,000 Cloud ERP customers, including many of the world's most important banks and leading logistics companies. Let's take a moment to look at the progress we continue to make in our Oracle ERP Cloud, starting with health care. We've got a very strong position in health care with the providers, including Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, Northwell Health, Tenet, HCM Health, Highmark Health, Humana, Cigna and many others. In Q4, we closed United Healthcare, a win over SAP. We won the NHS, the UK's second major move to the Cloud. We won New South Wales Ministry of Health in Australia for ERP and SCM. We won WellSpan, a regional provider in Pennsylvania with eight hospitals. We won Abcam, a UK life sciences company, increasing their footprint in ERP and SCM. Going live in Q4 were the Cleveland Clinic with ERP and SCM, UC Health for ERP and SCM, Pfizer on enterprise performance management, UK Health went live, Atrium Health went live, all in Q4. In financial services, our other really big vertical, we had, as I said earlier, we have a very strong position with the money center banks with ERP. Bank of America uses Fusion applications. JPMorgan Chase uses Fusion applications. So does Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Credit Agricole, SMFB, TD Bank, Societe Generale, Vanguard, State Street. I can go on and on, but let me go to the results in Q4. In Q4, we won at Citibank a big ERP win against SAP. We won at Chubb. We won at PNC, the sixth largest bank in the United States. We won at SMBC, the largest Japanese-owned bank in the United States. We won Oversea China Banking Corp. We won Mizuho, the third largest bank in Japan. TIAA, Desjardins, Mitsui Sumitomo also in Japan. GMP, one of Mexico's largest financial services company. We have a very, very strong position in financial services. That's one of the key groups of partners that we're working to automate B2B commerce, along with the logistics companies. In retail, we won, well, we already had Kohl's, Office Depot, Macy's, Kroger's, Albertson's, Petco, McDonald's, Chipotle, Tiffany, Sachs, Williams-Sonoma, Walmart, CVS, but in Q4, we added to that list. We added Lowe's and Albertson's and Sherwin-Williams and Abercrombie & Fitch. We had major go-lives at Macy's, Next Doors, and the Co-op Stores, all in retail. In communications, where we're already present at AT&T, Orange, MTN, Bharti Airtel, Rogers, Wind Tre, Telecom Italia, KPN and SEC, we won Virgin Media. We had a major expansion at AT&T, an ERP SCM expansion. We won a major expansion ERP and EPM at Verizon. Very, very strong quarter in telecommunications with a huge go-live at KPN, the Dutch telecom company, in ERP and SCM. Service wins, we already have PwC, KPMG, Booz Allen, True Blue, Securitas, Waste Management, Skanska, McDermott-Jacobs. We won in Q4 BDO, Verisk Analytics and the Mudafalo Group. Go-lives in Q4 in services included Pricewaterhouse, Manpower Group, TriNet and Republic Services. In the public sector, we had a major win at the State of Missouri, wall-to-wall at the State of Missouri, ERP, SCM, HCM. That was a win over Workday, SAP and everybody else. We won at the Scottish Government. We won at the UK Home Office. We won a State of Switzerland, Vaud. We won General Organization for Social Insurance in Saudi Arabia. We won a deal with the police department in the State of Victoria in Australia. We had major go-lives in public sector in the City of St. Louis and Norfolk County, UK. In hospitality, where we already have Marriott, Hilton, Caesar's, MGM, Lowes, Royal Caribbean and Park Hotels, we added Airbnb for ERP expansion, a win over Workday, and Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts. Logistics, again, this is our other big group of partners in our major effort to automate B2B commerce from within the Oracle ERP Cloud. We have a very strong position globally in logistics. Our customers include UPS, FedEx, DHL, Swift, Schneider, Union Pacific, Yellow. We added An Post, the postal service of Ireland. The go-lives included DHL, UPS and Deutsche Post. In higher ed, where we're already installed at Princeton, Cambridge, Julliard, Vanderbilt, UCLA, University of Chicago, Edenborough, Rutgers, Baylor, UCSD and lots and lots of others, we added the University of Maine, East Tennessee State, Villanova and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Other notable wins in the quarter, on high-tech, we won Teradata. We won a big win at Toyota Motor, an ERP win. At Denso, again, let's see, what else we got. Berry Global, let's see, AP Team was another ERP win in energies. Okay. So it was a very, very strong quarter. We're very excited about our momentum in ERP and how we can expand ERP from what it was when it was an on-premise system to what it can be in terms of B2B commerce automation now that it's a cloud system. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Safra. Well, the national health records database solves 2 problems, and it allows patients in the case of an emergency to have their caregivers get immediate access to all of their health records, which will deliver way better outcomes for people. The other is public health officials will get much better information about the state of health in their country. So I mean, the amount of -- having this knowledge, it's -- we dramatically improved healthcare but we also save an enormous amount of money by doing that. I don't know if you remember when we sent that hospital [shipped] (ph) in New York City because the officials in New York thought they were about to run out of the hospital beds. It turns out they were wrong. We didn't run out of hospital beds, but they didn't know. They don't have -- public health officials don't have access to that kind of information. They're a bit flying -- it was very clear there are -- in a lot of cases, they were flying blind during the pandemic. By providing this information, we save a lot of lives and we save a lot of money. The scale of the opportunity is gigantic because it's not -- people think of it as a national opportunity. It's a global opportunity. Every country -- I mean, if you look at Western Europe, the Western Europe budgets are dominated by health care. If they can save lives and save money by putting in modern information systems, they'll do it and they'll do it quickly. It's clearly going to be our largest business. Yes. With the exception of Workday, most of the big application companies maybe conspicuously, salesforce.com is a very large Oracle user. And they license our database for use in their cloud. But they're not the only ones. There are a lot of SaaS companies that use our database in the cloud. And that keeps our license business very, very strong. Our database license business is very, very strong. We don't confuse a license for on-premise. Some licenses classically are used on-premise, but a lot of the new licenses that we're selling allow our customers to take those licenses and run them in the cloud, whether it's our cloud or other people's clouds or in the case of Salesforce in their own cloud. So it's -- the Oracle database is still the #1 database in the world by a significant margin. And it's the #1 database in the cloud when you start counting all of the SaaS companies that use the Oracle Database. Well, I'm not sure I call it -- I'm sorry, Safra, Pease go ahead. Yes. Okay. I'm not sure I'd call it countercyclical, but the cloud systems cost a lot less than the on-premise systems to run. So -- and they give you much better information. They allow you to control expenses better. They don't cost that much to implement because you pay for them over time. So we -- what we're seeing is a -- let's take a look at NetSuite, which is the low end of the market, and you think those would be the companies to be most affected by the recession. It's not JPMorgan Chase. They'll keep building -- they'll keep putting in new systems. But some smaller entrepreneur-led companies, you think that the recession we got them. They had -- we got the most revenue we ever got from NetSuite this past quarter. and the highest growth rate that we've ever gotten from NetSuite this past quarter. They are accelerating into the recession because we think the benefits are enormous and it equips the companies to compete more effectively. And again, we don't see that business slowing down. Quite the contrary, we see our ERP business both Fusion and NetSuite accelerating. This in spite of the macroeconomic situation. Safra? I'll add 1 thing to that, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database is interesting because it's autonomous. In other words, it doesn't require human beings to run it like database administrators, things like that. Recently, inside of Oracle, inside of our cloud, virtually every database going up for -- to run our cloud, the autonomous database because people don't want to hire database administrators inside of Oracle Corporation. It's just much cheaper to run. And I think in that sense, the Autonomous database is countercyclical. You do save a huge amount of money just by moving from conventional Oracle database to the autonomous database. It's actually more secure, more reliable and cost Wales to run. You don't need a bunch of experts running it. You don't need anyone to run it. There is a programming language called APEX, which uses -- it's a low code programming environment where you use 10% the name amount of programmers that you would use if you were programming in our other programming language called Java. And APEX is also becoming very popular inside of Oracle to build applications. I see this as 2 interesting trends as people using more modern technology to dramatically reduce their labor costs, which I think will play very well in the next couple of years in this economy."

It's now my pleasure to hand today's conference over to Oracle Senior Vice President, Ken Bond.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from the Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. However, we will be making no comments regarding Cerner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the tragic events unfolding in Eastern Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are working incredibly hard to help our Ukrainian employees and support our customers and partners. We have suspended all Oracle operations in Russia, and we did so well over a week ago. I'll now turn to Oracle's third quarter results. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. And clearly, we had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing over 7%. Not only was total revenue above the midpoint of my guidance, but it was also the highest organic growth rate since we began our transition to the cloud. We saw broad-based outperformance in all segments. And for the first time in more than 10 years, all segments of our business saw growth. Total cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $11.2 billion, and they grew 26%. I expect the cloud revenue will exit the fiscal year growing in the mid-20s. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 8% and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues saw record level organic growth of 10% and were $3.2 billion. Fusion apps were up 29%, with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $5.1 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP, up 35%, and Fusion HCM, up 22%, and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.5 billion, up 7% and higher than last quarter. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 60%. And I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will trend higher over time. OCI consumption, which includes autonomous database, was up 93%, also higher than last quarter. And total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 43%, with the backlog for Cloud at Customer machines growing to triple digits. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 4%, and again, higher than last quarter. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4%, with strong performance in our tech business. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.5 billion, up over 7%, and as I mentioned earlier, our highest organic growth rate in over 10 years. Operating expenses were up 10% this quarter as we invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. The gross margins for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 5%. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be higher than last year. Our plan is to continue to grow profits while we push our top line growth into double digits next year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, higher than all of our competitors. Earnings per share was adversely affected by around $0.05 per share, primarily due to share price declines of equity investments impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, in line with our base tax rate. And earnings per share was $1.13 in U.S. dollars, up 1% in constant currency and down 3% in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 18.4%, slightly below our base rate and the GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $10.4 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $6.6 billion. Both results were negatively affected by a one-time litigation charge in Q2. Capital expenditures for the last 4 quarters were $3.8 billion, and CapEx for Q3 was $1.1 billion. And we're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have more than $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.9 billion, up 1%, with gross deferred revenue growing 6%. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $38.5 billion, up 13% in constant currency due to very strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 7 million shares for a total of 600 million as we reduced the buybacks in advance of the purchase of Cerner. We've paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our business is strong as our fast-growing cloud business continues to become a larger proportion of the overall business. A few points. First, my guidance assumes that Cerner does not close in Q4, though it very well may close in the quarter. And again, Cerner should be accretive in the first year. Secondly, cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business to on-premise. And I expect that our full year non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2022, which we're finishing now, will be 1% to 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. And as you all know, it was a lot of fluctuations this quarter. But assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 2% to 3% on revenue and $0.05 negative for EPS in Q4. Of course, the dollar could easily strengthen from here. Total revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 4% to 6% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 is expected to be between 1.40 and 1.44 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.35 and 1.39 in USD. Now both non-GAAP and GAAP EPS are expected to decline year-over-year due to some large investment gains we saw last year as well as a very low tax rate last year. It was 10.7%. Both of these masked the strong earnings growth and momentum we continue to see out of our core cloud business. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As I always say, however, onetime tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. I have 2 parts to my comments. I'm going to start with, if you will, business as usual. And that is going from strength to strength in our ERP and HCM cloud businesses. I'm going to go over the wins and the go-lives for our SaaS -- strategic SaaS business. Second, I'm going to talk about our brand-new MySQL HeatWave product. I think it's fair to say, and I'm going to read the quotes -- what I'm going to do is speak a little bit about it, and then I'm going to read the quotes from analysts and customers. And I think you'll find that we've never had a product so well received by customers and analysts in our history. I'm not sure the industry has either. These are really -- it's a remarkable innovation, but I'm going to get to that in a second. First, how is our SaaS business doing right now? Overall, we have incredible progress, winning more and more in the ERP and HCM back office. Q3 was an exceptionally strong quarter for ERP cloud sales. We now have over 10,000 Fusion ERP, HCM customers. And for the first time, we're beginning to see -- we've been in this business long enough. We're beginning to see us roll up certain industries, starting with the largest industry on Earth, health care. Okay. So how are we doing in health care? We already have Tenet Health, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Northwell Health, Mount Sinai, Atrium Health. I can go a long list of ERP and HCM wins in the health care -- those are all health care providers. We've added some additional health care providers, mainly hospitals and clinics. We've added the CHS Community Health Services. That's a consortium, that's 83 hospitals, and it's an ERP, HCM, SCM win there. And we're replacing Kronos. I call that out because Kronos -- hospitals really are -- while they're not recognized having some similarities to Uber, they have a lot of people that work at hospitals that are not employees at the hospitals. Hospitals have a gig economy. Doctors work in multiple hospitals, multiple clinics, have their own offices. Nurses, same thing. Scheduling and paying the workforce in hospitals is one of the most complicated things ongoing in our changing economy. And we have adapted our HCM systems so that we do help the hospitals recruit, track, schedule and pay for their health professionals. The only other company that was doing that, someone not very well known is Kronos. And we're beginning to replace out Kronos in the hospital space, and we did it to community health systems. We won an HCM deal over Workday at TriHealth. Loma Linda University's health care, health centers, we won an HCM over there, and they already have our ERP. Health care is interesting. I started by talking about hospitals, provide -- people who provide health care. Health care industry is much bigger than that. There are medical device manufacturers. They are pharmaceutical companies. They are the payers, insurance companies and government agencies that are all part of this health care ecosystem.  So we're not just focused on providers like hospitals and clinics, but also we won a big ERP deal over SAP at Johnson & Johnson -- at J&J. We won a big ERP deal over SAP at the medical device company, Haemonetics. We won an ERP deal at Saskatchewan Health Authority, one of the government payer, and most of the payers in health care are governments. So it's this entire ecosystem that we're building specific features and functions for to automate health care across the board. No one has been able to roll up health care. It was pack a little bit. This portion of just the providers, just the ambulatory clinics, just the inpatient hospitals, just the payers, just the pharmaceutical company, just the medical device. We're going after the entire integrated ecosystem, and we're having some great results. Obviously, that influenced our decision to buy Cerner. We have great go-lives at Franciscan Missionaries health system. That's a consortium of over 20 hospitals. We wanted INTEGRIS Health. They went live on our ERP, HCM, FCM, 16 hospitals. Nemours Children's Health went live in HCM with 34,000 users. So health care has been a real strength for us. And obviously, we'll get stronger with Cerner as we provide additional capability to providers. Okay.  The other industry that we've always outlined as being a key strategic target of ours in addition to health care are -- is financial services. And we have a very strong position in financial services, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Bank New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and a lot more are our customers in ERP and HCM. We just won TD Bank, ERP win over SAP at TD Bank. We just won Silicon Valley Bank, another win over SAP. We won Societe Generale in France. We now have 2 of the 3 largest banks after winning Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in Q2, and we will get the other one. We will get Paribas very soon. JPMorgan Chase just did a huge expansion of our -- on our HCM product. Discover, the credit card, just went live on ERP. So again, strong in financial services, getting even stronger. In Communications, our big customers, AT&T, Orange, MTN, Birdie, [Ultra], all around the world -- we just added a big ERP win at Rogers Communications. Huge go-live at Windtree, and that was a replacement. The go-live at Windtree was a replacement of SAP, not a win over SAP, but replacing an existing SAP system. In logistics and transportation, we had -- where -- our big customers are UPS, FedEx, Knight Swift, Yellow, Schneider National and so on. We had a big ERP HCM win over SAP at U.S. Express. We had an HCM win at TD for its freight where we replaced Workday. Didn't beat Workday. We replaced an existing Workday system. Go-live at DHL. DHL is really interesting. It was a go-live in Germany and Austria right in SAP's backyard. And we have a number of wins in Germany. I think this is why we're pretty confident these days against the former winner -- the winner on the on-premise ERP wars, SAP. In Germany, in SAP's backyard, we won DHL. We won Deutsche Post. We won Deutsche Bahn. We won D\u00fcrr IT Services, and we just added a win at Daimler truck over SAP. In Japan, a country really not known for buying package application software very much, we've got a pretty good position in Panasonic. We're in Panasonic. We're in Toyota. We're at Mizuho Financial Services. This quarter, big wins at Canon -- a big ERP win over SAP at Canon. A big win at Taisei that's one of the 5 largest general contractors in Japan.  So doing well in Germany, doing well in Japan, doing well in these big economies where, historically, we have not done that well in applications, but we are now. In grocery, where we have Sainsbury, Kellogg, Tesco, Auchan, Kroger and Albertsons. We had a huge ERP expansion at Kroger and a big go-live at Albertson with 280,000 users. Albertsons is now live on both HCM and financials. So very strong in grocery. Hotels and resorts were our big logos are Marriott, Hilton, Caesars, MGM. We just won Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts replacing as an HCM win -- replacing -- we're not allowed to name who we replaced in HCM other than to say they're a very large cloud competitor of ours. Hilton, we went live with HCM, the biggest HCM expansion in the UK.  Higher ed. Higher ed where our big logos are UCLA, Princeton, Rutgers, Vanderbilt, Penn State, University of Texas. We added an HCM win at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. We added 3 more campuses of the University of California system for ERP. We now have 6 of their 9 -- of the 9 campuses for ERP. Tennessee, University of Tennessee, we won ERP and HCM. The University of Arizona, big ERP win, all higher ed. But some of the other industries, in consumer goods, we had a really important win in ERP HCM at a division of Unilever. And that was an SAP replacement, not a win over SAP. We replaced them. In aerospace and defense, we won ERP and SCM at BAE Systems, a win over SAP. We won HCM over SAP at Tata Steel. We won a big -- a full suite expansion at Cummins. Eni, in oil and gas, which has always been an SAP -- very, very strong industry for SAP. We beat them, Eni, at a gas company. In the public sector, we got, well, a very important agency these days. The IOM, the UN agency, International Organization from Migrants. This, again, was a replacement of SAP. We also won the U.K. Ministry of Defense. We went live with a big bang, ERP, HCM, SCM for over 50,000 user go-live. In high tech, Zoom went live on ERP and SCM. Iron Mountain went live on ERP, SCM. Bed, Bath and Beyond went live on ERP. Tiffany went live on an HCM expansion for 300 of their stores. In engineering and construction, Jacobs went live on ERP and SCM. Environmental services, waste management, big suite go-live on ERP and supply chain. And I'll finish it off in professional services where ABM went live. Okay. So very, very strong quarter for us in the back office in ERP and HCM. Now I'd like to switch from SaaS to infrastructure. And we had a major announcement and -- are making a major announcement about our other database. The 2 much popular databases in the world are Oracle and MySQL. MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. MySQL is very good at transaction processing, but historically, has not been good at query processing. So MySQL customers usually use the MySQL database for query -- for transaction processing. And then they'll move their data from the MySQL database into Redshift, at Amazon or into Snowflake to do the query processing. That's how it's typically used. MySQL for transaction processing, Redshift, Snowflake for query processing. By the way, the AWS has their own version of MySQL. They call it Aurora. And the AWS, my Redshift, MySQL Aurora, Redshift business is a multibillion-dollar business. Oracle -- now we're going after that business in 2 ways. We built a product, MySQL HeatWave, which is different than earlier versions of MySQL. MySQL HeatWave is good at both transaction processing and query processing. So MySQL HeatWave doesn't simply replace Aurora. It replaces both Aurora and Redshift or it replaces both Aurora and Snowflake because MySQL HeatWave does transaction processing very well, replacing Aurora. And it does query processing a lot better than Redshift or Snowflake. Because HeatWave runs -- and we decided for the first time to make this a multicloud product. So Oracle HeatWave will run already in the Oracle Cloud, but it is -- we also have it up and running in AWS. And Azure users will be able to use it as well. So it is a multicloud product. AWS users -- why did we do that? We did that because we're going after the Aurora user base and the Redshift and Snowflake user base. We want to make it really easy to convert from Aurora and Redshift or Aurora and Snowflake to Oracle HeatWave. And if we're running an AWS, for example, you press a button, a couple of buttons, and your data is moved immediately to Oracle, MySQL HeatWave. You do not have to change your application at all. You press a couple of buttons, and you move it. Okay. Why would you do that? Well, because the cost performance benefits. So moving to MySQL HeatWave are extraordinary. Now I'm going to stop talking, and I'm going to start reading. And I'm going to start reading analyst quotes, and I'm going to read them word for word. So when I say the benefits are extraordinary, I'm understating what they're saying. So let me bring up the slides. I'm going to just start reading a few quotes. Okay. One industry analyst, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, MySQL database service may very well be the single greatest innovation in open source cloud databases in the past 20 years. MySQL HeatWave and Autopilot represent a quantum leap with top light query performance and superb transaction support. Oracle wants to open up a second front in the battle for the database market leadership. They're attracting an entirely different user base with this product. Wikibon believes that the technology underlying MySQL HeatWave is an inflection point in database design and architecture. The MySQL HeatWave technology is by far the best in the market. Oracle have shown AWS and Snowflake how to design and architect a true MySQL cloud database. Customers can expect MySQL HeatWave to outperform about 7x faster than Amazon Redshift or Snowflake at 2.5 -- 2 to 5x lower cost. The benefits against Amazon and Aurora are even greater. New entrants such as Snowflake will need to improve their cloud technology fast to stay competitive with HeatWave. This is all word for word what analysts are saying. And these are the most distinguished database analysts in the business. The bottom line is we believe the competition just got outplayed in every measurable metric imaginable. This represents a wake-up call for the industry and a rude awakening to the database cloud competition as they all must respond now to the MySQL innovation juggernaut. HeatWave is the physical manifestation of nearly 10 years of deep database engineering techniques, over 5 dozen patents and demonstrates what real cloud database innovation looks like in 2021. Oracle introduced MySQL HeatWave, and they did send shock waves because they named and shamed basically every database company out there. And my favorite is what they talked about with Snowflake. You can spend $80,000 on HeatWave, and that would cost you $420,000 to run on Snowflake. It's a no-brainer. These new fully transparent benchmarks -- by the way, we put all of our benchmarks on GitHub. It's all public. The code, the data, the customers can reproduce all of these benchmarks that the analysts are talking about. That's what the analysts did. The analysts went out and ran their own benchmarks. And they were shocked. These new fully transparent benchmarks demonstrate HeatWave's performance, price and scale advantages over all other MySQL and cloud databases. Clearly, the cloud data warehouse market wasn't ready for this. And now the competition needs to scramble as they grapple for answers. For organizations using MySQL, Oracle has given them yet another reason to invest in its HeatWave offering by delivering 7x the performance at 1/5 the cost of solutions such as Snowflake. Together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize -- it sounds like I wrote it, but I didn't. These are -- and we'll provide you with all of these quotes, all in -- full context, names, quotes. These are all analyst quotes. Taken together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize Amazon Redshift with AQUA. MySQL HeatWave's TPC-H analytics testing literally blows away Amazon's Redshift with AQUA in both performance and cost performance. It's 6.8x faster and 47% less expensive. Amazon Redshift with AQUA is 18x slower, resulting in MySQL HeatWave coming in at an extraordinary 17x better, 17x better cost performance. MySQL HeatWave with Autopilot sets the bar orders of magnitude higher than AWS, Azure, Google and Snowflake. I think I'll stop right there and turn it back to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Holly, if you could please prepare the audience for Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question for the day will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Congrats on the continued momentum and especially all those great customer wins, Larry. I have one quick one for Safra and then a follow-up for you. Safra, just looking at my model, it looks like you had your strongest organic revenue growth in 10 years this quarter. And I just want to make sure I've got that right, and I'm not missing anything.\nSafra Catz: Yes. You've got that right. And it's basically because of what I've been telling you all for a while, which is our fastest-growing business, which is our cloud, is now getting to be very big. And when you're growing different parts of the business, 25%, 30%, 40%, 60%, and it's a big number. It causes these -- it's just math here. It increases the overall rate of growth of the business.\nBrad Zelnick: And Larry, you now have an increasing number of ISPs that are now supporting and embedding OCI as well as targeted programs where you have some of the largest global SIs in the world really leaning in. Can you talk to us about how you're winning the ecosystem with OCI? And as well, if you can update us on the mix of traditional versus nontraditional Oracle workloads. Just help us get a sense of how the use cases are evolving and where you see that mix going.\nLawrence Ellison: Well, I think it's broad based. I think one of -- the back office -- one of our partners -- we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet with -- on a payment system, a B2B payment system because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. So if you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in Cloud ERP, what does the B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. And we want to automate that B2B transaction. There's 2 Oracle ERP systems are talking to one another. To automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that. We have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, a range of logistics. So we're working with large -- a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. Some of it's never been -- you don't think of ERP doing that, but it's this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That's a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system. So the banks are joining in. Logistic companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications and all the ISVs with adjacent applications wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers. The integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where customers are going. The ISVs -- and these are kind of interesting ISVs. Giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP system is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really had ever thought about before.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: I'm trying my luck here, Safra, but like any comments on the TikTok rumors that came out today? And then in case you want to answer that. Larry, one for you on, on that success in the back office systems, like is that driven by post-pandemic people realizing, oh, shoot, I really need to update that. So that's kind of more temporary boom that you're seeing here? Or do you think there's more legs to that?\nSafra Catz: The one thing I can tell you is we have an excellent relationship with the folks at TikTok.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. I'll second that. It's excellent. Let me take the other part of your question, which is, do I think this is a kind of a year 2000 like pandemic boom, people rushing to get to the cloud, and it's going to slow down after? Now that the pandemic, thank God, it's beginning to recede. Just the opposite, we're really still in the early days. We're in the early days of either understanding how different Cloud ERP is from on-premise ERP. And I just mentioned this one interesting example in that in the modern world, as more and more people go to Cloud ERP and you buy -- you procure something, that it's really one Oracle ERP system talking to another Oracle ERP system, but it needs to be facilitated through -- with a financial -- a finance partner and probably multiple finance partners and multiple logistics partners and -- to automate and finance and move that product from A to B and finance that product and understand when it's going to be delivered, all of those things. And so no, I think we're really in the early -- really early days. Even though we now have 10,000 customers in Oracle ERP Fusion, another -- almost 30,000 customers in total, including NetSuite, I still think we're in the very early days of doing this. It's just getting faster. I mean the growth -- our growth is accelerating, accelerating, accelerating. You look at our growth rate, it's not going down. We're getting bigger and the growth rate, and we're sustaining that mid-30s -- high 20s, mid-30s growth rate with NetSuite and Fusion in spite of the fact we've more than doubled.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Congrats on another quarter of accelerating growth. One comment from your script today really stood out to me, and that was continued to grow profits while we push our top line growth into the double digits next year. Now obviously, this is continued reacceleration from the 6% to 8% the past 2 quarters and your guidance, obviously, on a constant currency basis for Q4. So my question to you, Safra and Larry is, can you help just unpack this for us in terms of the puts and takes between database and apps, cloud on-premise, et cetera, that give you confidence for continued acceleration in the double digits, but also, like you said, while growing profits?\nSafra Catz: Okay. So as you've seen, we've made a lot of investments. We basically -- our CapEx this year is double last year, and that's because we've been putting out a lot of capability around the world. Simultaneously, our revenues have been increasing. But over the past few years, we've had parts of the business that were significant parts of the business that were shrinking. And now, as you see in this quarter, for example, all lines of businesses are increasing. We have -- different lines of business have bookings growth, some of which are as high as well over 100%. And so what's happened is the -- most of the business is now growing. And so they're much less of the negatives. And the things that we're getting smaller like application license, for example, is a very small number now. And then, of course, our technology license is going very, very well, including, just this quarter, technology was up 9%. So the cloud business is on an absolute role. You can see it in the numbers already and ERP, HCM, but also, of course, OCI straight and autonomous database. And just all those parts of the business are now growing, and they're large. And the shrinking parts of the business -- first of all, there's a lot less shrinking. We grew and to the extent that we have some supply chain loosening where we are able to deliver all of our bookings, we just expect growth sort of all over the place. And so we're very upbeat about this next year.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Congratulations on a great quarter. It's great to see the momentum really showing through to the results now. Last quarter, you guys talked a lot about an increasing focus on verticals, particularly banking and health care. This quarter, you're talking about rolling up some of those verticals. Can you talk to us a little bit more about the approach on how you build up and create that roll up in the vertical? How much of that effort is building like vertical-specific products? How much of it is a new go-to-market strategy, if you will, or aligning the go-to-market strategy for those verticals? And how much work is left to be done on those 2 sides?\nLawrence Ellison: Well, let me just start with health care because you think of health care as a vertical, and Cerner is certainly in a vertical, which is an epic they compete for providers. And people think of that as, well, that's health care. But that's not health care. There's clinical trials for -- in pharmaceutical companies. You want to integrate -- the clinical trials the pharmaceutical companies pay for and run, but actually not really. The providers run those clinical trials. So the whole ecosystem -- no one's ever tried to do the entire ecosystem. But to answer your question, we had -- we are greatly enhancing our HCM system for hospitals so that they can have nurses that work 3 days a week or 4 days a week and doctors that work in a couple of different hospitals. And scheduling these independent contractors, if you will, is very complicated. You don't of think of hospitals as being a collection of independent contractors, but it's full-time workers and independent contractors, and scheduling that is complex. Paying them is complex. Some of them are unionized. The rules are complex. So we're doing a massive -- we're doing a lot of industry-specific features for hospitals to help them manage their workforce. In inventory -- hospital inventory isn't in a warehouse. Hospital inventory -- the drug, they're scattered all throughout the hospital. Nurses stations have drugs -- there's an interesting drug called tranexamic acid, which is used to stop bleeding. Where you can't go to the warehouse, someone's bleeding, you can't go to the warehouse and look for the drug. You've got to be able to find it immediately, and it's got to be close to the operating room. It's got to be close to -- where intensive -- the intensive care unit. So the inventory is distributed all throughout the hospital. So we are paying RFID tags in all the inventory so you can find things very, very quickly. So how we handle inventory is being enhanced specifically for hospitals. And I can go on and on. One thing a doctor does is before I can authorize a test, before I can authorize prescribing a drug for a patient, I have to check with the insurance company to make sure they'll pay for it. Now -- so the doctors and hospitals spend a lot of time negotiating with the payer, the insurance company. Well, okay, given these symptoms, can I get this test paid for? Yes, no? Given these symptoms, can I get this drug paid for? Yes, no? We're automating that interaction between the payers and the providers. So yes, we're adding a lot of industry-specific features to automate the interactions in the entire ecosystem. And that's why we think we're in a good position to roll up health care, which is a gigantic industry. No one's ever really tried this before, but we have all the pieces. We have the payment pieces. We automate a lot of the insurers. We have HCM, which allows us to help them manage their workforce. We have ERP, which helps them keep track of inventory. And soon, we will have Cerner, which will help them to deliver care to patients. So we'll be -- and we have clinical trial system for the pharmaceutical noise. We have the entire portfolio, and we're interconnecting all the pieces so we can make that ecosystem work efficiently for the first time. And actually, the pandemic has showed we're in desperate need of such an integrated system.\nKeith Weiss: Yes. It sounds like a massive value unlock if it gets all pulled together.\nLawrence Ellison: I think we can do it. We're on our way to do it. And the benefits to Oracle are great. But actually, it's -- this is -- at least for me, personally, this is a mission. I think the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our health care systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do.\nSafra Catz: Okay. Let me just say one other thing. So we have a number of vertical industries in which we have products, and our competitors don't have products. And this has been a core part of how we work. We work with retailers. We work in financial services. We work in utilities. We work in construction engineering. We don't just modify ERP systems slightly and say we're in the industry. We're actually in operational systems in the industry, and it brings incredible value to our customers to be able to use these products.\nOperator: Our last question for the day will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Safra, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the strength in Cloud at Customer. And just really 2 things about that. How should we think about Cloud at Customer being somewhat of a leading indicator for adoption of autonomous database? And then are any of the supply constraints starting to loosen up a bit on that front in terms of maybe helping to accelerate rev rec in that area over the next couple of quarters?\nSafra Catz: Well, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true. That backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want Cloud at Customer or they want hardware. And I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities. The reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally. We've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special or whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. And we are meeting everyone's needs. And I think that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling and a line of sight on how to deliver it. So now I read the newspapers -- actually, I don't read the newspaper. I read the computer that used to be a newspaper, and so we see everything that's going on. But I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute.\nOperator: And that will conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn it over to management for their closing comments.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Holly. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Holly to close the call.\nOperator: Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's Oracle Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the tragic events unfolding in Eastern Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are working incredibly hard to help our Ukrainian employees and support our customers and partners. We have suspended all Oracle operations in Russia, and we did so well over a week ago. I'll now turn to Oracle's third quarter results. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. And clearly, we had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing over 7%. Not only was total revenue above the midpoint of my guidance, but it was also the highest organic growth rate since we began our transition to the cloud. We saw broad-based outperformance in all segments. And for the first time in more than 10 years, all segments of our business saw growth. Total cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $11.2 billion, and they grew 26%. I expect the cloud revenue will exit the fiscal year growing in the mid-20s. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 8% and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues saw record level organic growth of 10% and were $3.2 billion. Fusion apps were up 29%, with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $5.1 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP, up 35%, and Fusion HCM, up 22%, and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.5 billion, up 7% and higher than last quarter. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 60%. And I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will trend higher over time. OCI consumption, which includes autonomous database, was up 93%, also higher than last quarter. And total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 43%, with the backlog for Cloud at Customer machines growing to triple digits. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 4%, and again, higher than last quarter. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4%, with strong performance in our tech business. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.5 billion, up over 7%, and as I mentioned earlier, our highest organic growth rate in over 10 years. Operating expenses were up 10% this quarter as we invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. The gross margins for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 5%. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be higher than last year. Our plan is to continue to grow profits while we push our top line growth into double digits next year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, higher than all of our competitors. Earnings per share was adversely affected by around $0.05 per share, primarily due to share price declines of equity investments impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, in line with our base tax rate. And earnings per share was $1.13 in U.S. dollars, up 1% in constant currency and down 3% in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 18.4%, slightly below our base rate and the GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $10.4 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $6.6 billion. Both results were negatively affected by a one-time litigation charge in Q2. Capital expenditures for the last 4 quarters were $3.8 billion, and CapEx for Q3 was $1.1 billion. And we're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have more than $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.9 billion, up 1%, with gross deferred revenue growing 6%. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $38.5 billion, up 13% in constant currency due to very strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 7 million shares for a total of 600 million as we reduced the buybacks in advance of the purchase of Cerner. We've paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our business is strong as our fast-growing cloud business continues to become a larger proportion of the overall business. A few points. First, my guidance assumes that Cerner does not close in Q4, though it very well may close in the quarter. And again, Cerner should be accretive in the first year. Secondly, cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business to on-premise. And I expect that our full year non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2022, which we're finishing now, will be 1% to 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. And as you all know, it was a lot of fluctuations this quarter. But assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 2% to 3% on revenue and $0.05 negative for EPS in Q4. Of course, the dollar could easily strengthen from here. Total revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 4% to 6% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 is expected to be between 1.40 and 1.44 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.35 and 1.39 in USD. Now both non-GAAP and GAAP EPS are expected to decline year-over-year due to some large investment gains we saw last year as well as a very low tax rate last year. It was 10.7%. Both of these masked the strong earnings growth and momentum we continue to see out of our core cloud business. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As I always say, however, onetime tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Yes. You've got that right. And it's basically because of what I've been telling you all for a while, which is our fastest-growing business, which is our cloud, is now getting to be very big. And when you're growing different parts of the business, 25%, 30%, 40%, 60%, and it's a big number. It causes these -- it's just math here. It increases the overall rate of growth of the business. The one thing I can tell you is we have an excellent relationship with the folks at TikTok. Okay. So as you've seen, we've made a lot of investments. We basically -- our CapEx this year is double last year, and that's because we've been putting out a lot of capability around the world. Simultaneously, our revenues have been increasing. But over the past few years, we've had parts of the business that were significant parts of the business that were shrinking. And now, as you see in this quarter, for example, all lines of businesses are increasing. We have -- different lines of business have bookings growth, some of which are as high as well over 100%. And so what's happened is the -- most of the business is now growing. And so they're much less of the negatives. And the things that we're getting smaller like application license, for example, is a very small number now. And then, of course, our technology license is going very, very well, including, just this quarter, technology was up 9%. So the cloud business is on an absolute role. You can see it in the numbers already and ERP, HCM, but also, of course, OCI straight and autonomous database. And just all those parts of the business are now growing, and they're large. And the shrinking parts of the business -- first of all, there's a lot less shrinking. We grew and to the extent that we have some supply chain loosening where we are able to deliver all of our bookings, we just expect growth sort of all over the place. And so we're very upbeat about this next year. Okay. Let me just say one other thing. So we have a number of vertical industries in which we have products, and our competitors don't have products. And this has been a core part of how we work. We work with retailers. We work in financial services. We work in utilities. We work in construction engineering. We don't just modify ERP systems slightly and say we're in the industry. We're actually in operational systems in the industry, and it brings incredible value to our customers to be able to use these products. Well, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true. That backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want Cloud at Customer or they want hardware. And I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities. The reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally. We've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special or whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. And we are meeting everyone's needs. And I think that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling and a line of sight on how to deliver it. So now I read the newspapers -- actually, I don't read the newspaper. I read the computer that used to be a newspaper, and so we see everything that's going on. But I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute."

            "content": "Thank you, Safra. I have 2 parts to my comments. I'm going to start with, if you will, business as usual. And that is going from strength to strength in our ERP and HCM cloud businesses. I'm going to go over the wins and the go-lives for our SaaS -- strategic SaaS business. Second, I'm going to talk about our brand-new MySQL HeatWave product. I think it's fair to say, and I'm going to read the quotes -- what I'm going to do is speak a little bit about it, and then I'm going to read the quotes from analysts and customers. And I think you'll find that we've never had a product so well received by customers and analysts in our history. I'm not sure the industry has either. These are really -- it's a remarkable innovation, but I'm going to get to that in a second. First, how is our SaaS business doing right now? Overall, we have incredible progress, winning more and more in the ERP and HCM back office. Q3 was an exceptionally strong quarter for ERP cloud sales. We now have over 10,000 Fusion ERP, HCM customers. And for the first time, we're beginning to see -- we've been in this business long enough. We're beginning to see us roll up certain industries, starting with the largest industry on Earth, health care. Okay. So how are we doing in health care? We already have Tenet Health, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Northwell Health, Mount Sinai, Atrium Health. I can go a long list of ERP and HCM wins in the health care -- those are all health care providers. We've added some additional health care providers, mainly hospitals and clinics. We've added the CHS Community Health Services. That's a consortium, that's 83 hospitals, and it's an ERP, HCM, SCM win there. And we're replacing Kronos. I call that out because Kronos -- hospitals really are -- while they're not recognized having some similarities to Uber, they have a lot of people that work at hospitals that are not employees at the hospitals. Hospitals have a gig economy. Doctors work in multiple hospitals, multiple clinics, have their own offices. Nurses, same thing. Scheduling and paying the workforce in hospitals is one of the most complicated things ongoing in our changing economy. And we have adapted our HCM systems so that we do help the hospitals recruit, track, schedule and pay for their health professionals. The only other company that was doing that, someone not very well known is Kronos. And we're beginning to replace out Kronos in the hospital space, and we did it to community health systems. We won an HCM deal over Workday at TriHealth. Loma Linda University's health care, health centers, we won an HCM over there, and they already have our ERP. Health care is interesting. I started by talking about hospitals, provide -- people who provide health care. Health care industry is much bigger than that. There are medical device manufacturers. They are pharmaceutical companies. They are the payers, insurance companies and government agencies that are all part of this health care ecosystem.  So we're not just focused on providers like hospitals and clinics, but also we won a big ERP deal over SAP at Johnson & Johnson -- at J&J. We won a big ERP deal over SAP at the medical device company, Haemonetics. We won an ERP deal at Saskatchewan Health Authority, one of the government payer, and most of the payers in health care are governments. So it's this entire ecosystem that we're building specific features and functions for to automate health care across the board. No one has been able to roll up health care. It was pack a little bit. This portion of just the providers, just the ambulatory clinics, just the inpatient hospitals, just the payers, just the pharmaceutical company, just the medical device. We're going after the entire integrated ecosystem, and we're having some great results. Obviously, that influenced our decision to buy Cerner. We have great go-lives at Franciscan Missionaries health system. That's a consortium of over 20 hospitals. We wanted INTEGRIS Health. They went live on our ERP, HCM, FCM, 16 hospitals. Nemours Children's Health went live in HCM with 34,000 users. So health care has been a real strength for us. And obviously, we'll get stronger with Cerner as we provide additional capability to providers. Okay.  The other industry that we've always outlined as being a key strategic target of ours in addition to health care are -- is financial services. And we have a very strong position in financial services, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Bank New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Cre\u0301dit Agricole and a lot more are our customers in ERP and HCM. We just won TD Bank, ERP win over SAP at TD Bank. We just won Silicon Valley Bank, another win over SAP. We won Societe Generale in France. We now have 2 of the 3 largest banks after winning Cre\u0301dit Agricole in Q2, and we will get the other one. We will get Paribas very soon. JPMorgan Chase just did a huge expansion of our -- on our HCM product. Discover, the credit card, just went live on ERP. So again, strong in financial services, getting even stronger. In Communications, our big customers, AT&T, Orange, MTN, Birdie, [Ultra], all around the world -- we just added a big ERP win at Rogers Communications. Huge go-live at Windtree, and that was a replacement. The go-live at Windtree was a replacement of SAP, not a win over SAP, but replacing an existing SAP system. In logistics and transportation, we had -- where -- our big customers are UPS, FedEx, Knight Swift, Yellow, Schneider National and so on. We had a big ERP HCM win over SAP at U.S. Express. We had an HCM win at TD for its freight where we replaced Workday. Didn't beat Workday. We replaced an existing Workday system. Go-live at DHL. DHL is really interesting. It was a go-live in Germany and Austria right in SAP's backyard. And we have a number of wins in Germany. I think this is why we're pretty confident these days against the former winner -- the winner on the on-premise ERP wars, SAP. In Germany, in SAP's backyard, we won DHL. We won Deutsche Post. We won Deutsche Bahn. We won Du\u0308rr IT Services, and we just added a win at Daimler truck over SAP. In Japan, a country really not known for buying package application software very much, we've got a pretty good position in Panasonic. We're in Panasonic. We're in Toyota. We're at Mizuho Financial Services. This quarter, big wins at Canon -- a big ERP win over SAP at Canon. A big win at Taisei that's one of the 5 largest general contractors in Japan.  So doing well in Germany, doing well in Japan, doing well in these big economies where, historically, we have not done that well in applications, but we are now. In grocery, where we have Sainsbury, Kellogg, Tesco, Auchan, Kroger and Albertsons. We had a huge ERP expansion at Kroger and a big go-live at Albertson with 280,000 users. Albertsons is now live on both HCM and financials. So very strong in grocery. Hotels and resorts were our big logos are Marriott, Hilton, Caesars, MGM. We just won Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts replacing as an HCM win -- replacing -- we're not allowed to name who we replaced in HCM other than to say they're a very large cloud competitor of ours. Hilton, we went live with HCM, the biggest HCM expansion in the UK.  Higher ed. Higher ed where our big logos are UCLA, Princeton, Rutgers, Vanderbilt, Penn State, University of Texas. We added an HCM win at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. We added 3 more campuses of the University of California system for ERP. We now have 6 of their 9 -- of the 9 campuses for ERP. Tennessee, University of Tennessee, we won ERP and HCM. The University of Arizona, big ERP win, all higher ed. But some of the other industries, in consumer goods, we had a really important win in ERP HCM at a division of Unilever. And that was an SAP replacement, not a win over SAP. We replaced them. In aerospace and defense, we won ERP and SCM at BAE Systems, a win over SAP. We won HCM over SAP at Tata Steel. We won a big -- a full suite expansion at Cummins. Eni, in oil and gas, which has always been an SAP -- very, very strong industry for SAP. We beat them, Eni, at a gas company. In the public sector, we got, well, a very important agency these days. The IOM, the UN agency, International Organization from Migrants. This, again, was a replacement of SAP. We also won the U.K. Ministry of Defense. We went live with a big bang, ERP, HCM, SCM for over 50,000 user go-live. In high tech, Zoom went live on ERP and SCM. Iron Mountain went live on ERP, SCM. Bed, Bath and Beyond went live on ERP. Tiffany went live on an HCM expansion for 300 of their stores. In engineering and construction, Jacobs went live on ERP and SCM. Environmental services, waste management, big suite go-live on ERP and supply chain. And I'll finish it off in professional services where ABM went live. Okay. So very, very strong quarter for us in the back office in ERP and HCM. Now I'd like to switch from SaaS to infrastructure. And we had a major announcement and -- are making a major announcement about our other database. The 2 much popular databases in the world are Oracle and MySQL. MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. MySQL is very good at transaction processing, but historically, has not been good at query processing. So MySQL customers usually use the MySQL database for query -- for transaction processing. And then they'll move their data from the MySQL database into Redshift, at Amazon or into Snowflake to do the query processing. That's how it's typically used. MySQL for transaction processing, Redshift, Snowflake for query processing. By the way, the AWS has their own version of MySQL. They call it Aurora. And the AWS, my Redshift, MySQL Aurora, Redshift business is a multibillion-dollar business. Oracle -- now we're going after that business in 2 ways. We built a product, MySQL HeatWave, which is different than earlier versions of MySQL. MySQL HeatWave is good at both transaction processing and query processing. So MySQL HeatWave doesn't simply replace Aurora. It replaces both Aurora and Redshift or it replaces both Aurora and Snowflake because MySQL HeatWave does transaction processing very well, replacing Aurora. And it does query processing a lot better than Redshift or Snowflake. Because HeatWave runs -- and we decided for the first time to make this a multicloud product. So Oracle HeatWave will run already in the Oracle Cloud, but it is -- we also have it up and running in AWS. And Azure users will be able to use it as well. So it is a multicloud product. AWS users -- why did we do that? We did that because we're going after the Aurora user base and the Redshift and Snowflake user base. We want to make it really easy to convert from Aurora and Redshift or Aurora and Snowflake to Oracle HeatWave. And if we're running an AWS, for example, you press a button, a couple of buttons, and your data is moved immediately to Oracle, MySQL HeatWave. You do not have to change your application at all. You press a couple of buttons, and you move it. Okay. Why would you do that? Well, because the cost performance benefits. So moving to MySQL HeatWave are extraordinary. Now I'm going to stop talking, and I'm going to start reading. And I'm going to start reading analyst quotes, and I'm going to read them word for word. So when I say the benefits are extraordinary, I'm understating what they're saying. So let me bring up the slides. I'm going to just start reading a few quotes. Okay. One industry analyst, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, MySQL database service may very well be the single greatest innovation in open source cloud databases in the past 20 years. MySQL HeatWave and Autopilot represent a quantum leap with top light query performance and superb transaction support. Oracle wants to open up a second front in the battle for the database market leadership. They're attracting an entirely different user base with this product. Wikibon believes that the technology underlying MySQL HeatWave is an inflection point in database design and architecture. The MySQL HeatWave technology is by far the best in the market. Oracle have shown AWS and Snowflake how to design and architect a true MySQL cloud database. Customers can expect MySQL HeatWave to outperform about 7x faster than Amazon Redshift or Snowflake at 2.5 -- 2 to 5x lower cost. The benefits against Amazon and Aurora are even greater. New entrants such as Snowflake will need to improve their cloud technology fast to stay competitive with HeatWave. This is all word for word what analysts are saying. And these are the most distinguished database analysts in the business. The bottom line is we believe the competition just got outplayed in every measurable metric imaginable. This represents a wake-up call for the industry and a rude awakening to the database cloud competition as they all must respond now to the MySQL innovation juggernaut. HeatWave is the physical manifestation of nearly 10 years of deep database engineering techniques, over 5 dozen patents and demonstrates what real cloud database innovation looks like in 2021. Oracle introduced MySQL HeatWave, and they did send shock waves because they named and shamed basically every database company out there. And my favorite is what they talked about with Snowflake. You can spend $80,000 on HeatWave, and that would cost you $420,000 to run on Snowflake. It's a no-brainer. These new fully transparent benchmarks -- by the way, we put all of our benchmarks on GitHub. It's all public. The code, the data, the customers can reproduce all of these benchmarks that the analysts are talking about. That's what the analysts did. The analysts went out and ran their own benchmarks. And they were shocked. These new fully transparent benchmarks demonstrate HeatWave's performance, price and scale advantages over all other MySQL and cloud databases. Clearly, the cloud data warehouse market wasn't ready for this. And now the competition needs to scramble as they grapple for answers. For organizations using MySQL, Oracle has given them yet another reason to invest in its HeatWave offering by delivering 7x the performance at 1/5 the cost of solutions such as Snowflake. Together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize -- it sounds like I wrote it, but I didn't. These are -- and we'll provide you with all of these quotes, all in -- full context, names, quotes. These are all analyst quotes. Taken together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize Amazon Redshift with AQUA. MySQL HeatWave's TPC-H analytics testing literally blows away Amazon's Redshift with AQUA in both performance and cost performance. It's 6.8x faster and 47% less expensive. Amazon Redshift with AQUA is 18x slower, resulting in MySQL HeatWave coming in at an extraordinary 17x better, 17x better cost performance. MySQL HeatWave with Autopilot sets the bar orders of magnitude higher than AWS, Azure, Google and Snowflake. I think I'll stop right there and turn it back to Safra. Well, I think it's broad based. I think one of -- the back office -- one of our partners -- we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet with -- on a payment system, a B2B payment system because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. So if you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in Cloud ERP, what does the B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. And we want to automate that B2B transaction. There's 2 Oracle ERP systems are talking to one another. To automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that. We have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, a range of logistics. So we're working with large -- a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. Some of it's never been -- you don't think of ERP doing that, but it's this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That's a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system. So the banks are joining in. Logistic companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications and all the ISVs with adjacent applications wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers. The integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where customers are going. The ISVs -- and these are kind of interesting ISVs. Giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP system is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really had ever thought about before. Yes. I'll second that. It's excellent. Let me take the other part of your question, which is, do I think this is a kind of a year 2000 like pandemic boom, people rushing to get to the cloud, and it's going to slow down after? Now that the pandemic, thank God, it's beginning to recede. Just the opposite, we're really still in the early days. We're in the early days of either understanding how different Cloud ERP is from on-premise ERP. And I just mentioned this one interesting example in that in the modern world, as more and more people go to Cloud ERP and you buy -- you procure something, that it's really one Oracle ERP system talking to another Oracle ERP system, but it needs to be facilitated through -- with a financial -- a finance partner and probably multiple finance partners and multiple logistics partners and -- to automate and finance and move that product from A to B and finance that product and understand when it's going to be delivered, all of those things. And so no, I think we're really in the early -- really early days. Even though we now have 10,000 customers in Oracle ERP Fusion, another -- almost 30,000 customers in total, including NetSuite, I still think we're in the very early days of doing this. It's just getting faster. I mean the growth -- our growth is accelerating, accelerating, accelerating. You look at our growth rate, it's not going down. We're getting bigger and the growth rate, and we're sustaining that mid-30s -- high 20s, mid-30s growth rate with NetSuite and Fusion in spite of the fact we've more than doubled. Well, let me just start with health care because you think of health care as a vertical, and Cerner is certainly in a vertical, which is an epic they compete for providers. And people think of that as, well, that's health care. But that's not health care. There's clinical trials for -- in pharmaceutical companies. You want to integrate -- the clinical trials the pharmaceutical companies pay for and run, but actually not really. The providers run those clinical trials. So the whole ecosystem -- no one's ever tried to do the entire ecosystem. But to answer your question, we had -- we are greatly enhancing our HCM system for hospitals so that they can have nurses that work 3 days a week or 4 days a week and doctors that work in a couple of different hospitals. And scheduling these independent contractors, if you will, is very complicated. You don't of think of hospitals as being a collection of independent contractors, but it's full-time workers and independent contractors, and scheduling that is complex. Paying them is complex. Some of them are unionized. The rules are complex. So we're doing a massive -- we're doing a lot of industry-specific features for hospitals to help them manage their workforce. In inventory -- hospital inventory isn't in a warehouse. Hospital inventory -- the drug, they're scattered all throughout the hospital. Nurses stations have drugs -- there's an interesting drug called tranexamic acid, which is used to stop bleeding. Where you can't go to the warehouse, someone's bleeding, you can't go to the warehouse and look for the drug. You've got to be able to find it immediately, and it's got to be close to the operating room. It's got to be close to -- where intensive -- the intensive care unit. So the inventory is distributed all throughout the hospital. So we are paying RFID tags in all the inventory so you can find things very, very quickly. So how we handle inventory is being enhanced specifically for hospitals. And I can go on and on. One thing a doctor does is before I can authorize a test, before I can authorize prescribing a drug for a patient, I have to check with the insurance company to make sure they'll pay for it. Now -- so the doctors and hospitals spend a lot of time negotiating with the payer, the insurance company. Well, okay, given these symptoms, can I get this test paid for? Yes, no? Given these symptoms, can I get this drug paid for? Yes, no? We're automating that interaction between the payers and the providers. So yes, we're adding a lot of industry-specific features to automate the interactions in the entire ecosystem. And that's why we think we're in a good position to roll up health care, which is a gigantic industry. No one's ever really tried this before, but we have all the pieces. We have the payment pieces. We automate a lot of the insurers. We have HCM, which allows us to help them manage their workforce. We have ERP, which helps them keep track of inventory. And soon, we will have Cerner, which will help them to deliver care to patients. So we'll be -- and we have clinical trial system for the pharmaceutical noise. We have the entire portfolio, and we're interconnecting all the pieces so we can make that ecosystem work efficiently for the first time. And actually, the pandemic has showed we're in desperate need of such an integrated system. I think we can do it. We're on our way to do it. And the benefits to Oracle are great. But actually, it's -- this is -- at least for me, personally, this is a mission. I think the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our health care systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we would caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest-growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue grew 6% in constant currency, above the high-end of my guidance, with broad-based outperformance across the company. Q3 revenue growth looks like it will continue even higher, but let me save that for the guidance discussion. Earnings were also strong, with non-GAAP EPS $0.09 above the high-end of my constant currency guidance. We achieved this outperformance despite the U.S. dollar strengthening since I gave guidance, as we saw a currency headwind of nearly $100 million to revenue and $0.01 to EPS, so the USD results, which are excellent and above guidance are even stronger than they appear. Before I go through the numbers, though, I wanted to comment on what we are seeing in the market that is driving our accelerating revenue growth. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we have a highly differentiated strategy from our competitors where we are the only company able to offer the combination of applications and infrastructure in the cloud. We have best-of-breed capabilities in both infrastructure and apps like HR and ERP, but also a highly differentiated set of industry-specific cloud SaaS applications and of course, our second-generation cloud with Autonomous Database are unique in their performance, security and dependability. And because we have decades of experience in mission-critical systems, our customers can depend on us being up and available when they need us. Our unique capabilities are attracting customers, especially as they consider how to conduct their own digital transformation in the complex industries in which they compete. They want us to know as much about their business as they do, whether it's telco, financial services, utilities, retail and many others and to partner with them to modernize. Once a company thinks beyond simple dev test and other rudimentary cloud workloads and move their technology focus to mission-critical projects, they invariably turn to Oracle. Our focus on customer success is driving more references and new opportunities with both existing customers and with entirely new accounts. And of course, we ourselves are an Oracle Fusion full suite user, and I'm sure it is not lost on any of you and it's not lost on our prospects and customers that we are announcing our results nine days after the quarter closed because of our systems and their embedded processes. Okay. Back to the numbers. And from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues, when annualized are now $10.7 billion and grew 22%, with cloud bookings growing faster than our cloud revenue growth rate. And as a result, we expect cloud revenue will accelerate further and exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s, potentially higher. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3.1 billion, up 8% organically in constant currency and our highest growth rate in four years. Fusion apps were up 30% with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $4.9 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP up 35%, Fusion HCM up 25%, and NetSuite ERP up 28%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% and excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 50%. I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will continue to ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 86% in constant currency and total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 45%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services were up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.2 billion, up 16% amongst our very best quarters over the last 10 years and license growth was not dependent on any mega deals. We saw excellent performance in technology, our vertical businesses as well as North America and Latin American regions. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up 6% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and gross profit dollars grew 5% in constant currency. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to or better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year and the operating margin was 47%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, slightly higher than our base rate of 19% and earnings per share was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in constant currency. During the quarter, we recognized GAAP acquisition-related and other expenses totaling $4.7 billion, which substantially consisted of litigation-related charges that will not recur. They relate to a dispute that arose when we hired my former co-CEO in 2010. As a result of this one-time charge, GAAP net income was a negative $1.2 billion. The GAAP tax rate was 16.6% due to some discrete items and the GAAP loss was $0.46 per share. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $10.3 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $7.1 billion. Both results were negatively affected by the litigation charges I mentioned. Capital expenditures for the last four quarters were $3.1 billion, and CapEx for Q2 alone was $925 million and we are on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have nearly $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is nearly $8 billion, up slightly in constant currency from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments with gross deferred revenue growing 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $37.2 billion, up 11% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said so many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 77 million shares for a total of $7 billion. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 47% at an average price that's about half the current share price. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion. We've paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now the guidance. I'm going to start by reiterating our expectation that full-year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate from 2021 for all the reasons we've already seen so far this year. Given the strong performance in the first half, I now expect that we will see full-year total revenue finish solidly in the mid-single digits, led by cloud revenue growth exiting the year in the mid-20s. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise, and I expect that our operating margins this year will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. I know you all saw that. And assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which we have no idea if they will or not, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 3% for revenue and $0.05 for EPS in Q3. Total revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Clearly, the midpoint of the range is 7%, and that is higher than the 6% we just reported in Q2 and higher than the 2% we reported in Q1. So everything is trending in the right direction. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in constant currency and be between $1.19 and $1.23 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to grow between negative 2 and positive 2 in USD and be between $1.14 and $1.18 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. All right, I'm going to discuss Oracle's Cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today? I mean a lot of the people \u2013 a lot of the companies like Microsoft did a great job of moving their entire Microsoft Office installed base into the cloud to dramatically increase the size of their cloud business. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same option or opportunity, so I think it's \u2013 to me, I think you are going to find this interesting. So how big is our on-premise business today? Well, we had 7,500 customers in Oracle on-premise, their ERP made up of E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Only 1,000 of those 7,500 have moved to Fusion Cloud ERP. Now we have not lost any of these customers to competitors. We expect all the remaining 6,500 to move to Fusion ERP, but it hasn't happened yet. That's all upside. That's all upside. And I think a lot of people don't really realize that how \u2013 so now let's migrate over and look at how big is our cloud ERP business today. Well, round number is $5 billion a year revenue, and we have 8,500 Fusion customers. But remember only 1,000 of those 8,500 came from our old on-premise business. 6,500, plenty to come. So 7,500 of these 8,500 were not running Oracle ERP before we came out with our cloud product. Those are all new customers. Add to that the 28,000 new NetSuite customers. So Oracle has a total of 35,500 cloud ERP customers that are new to Oracle. Only 1,000 of our on-premise installed base has migrated so far. Let me repeat that. 35,500 net new cloud ERP customers we got in the last few years. Only 1,000 from our installed base that's going to be coming to us later on. So how fast is cloud ERP revenue growing about? So growing about 30% a year. And so let's look out five years and ask the question, how big will we be in five years? And I think the number would be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating, our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base, they are coming from someone else's installed base. And again, yes \u2013 85% of our current \u2013 that we have are from someone else's installed base. So what are our margins in this five year? Let's say, we are estimating $20 billion cloud ERP business. Well, it's scale, at that scale, that's about an 85% margin in that business. And as Safra pointed out earlier in her comments, the cloud business is inherently much more profitable and much more predictable than our old on-premise business. So we expect five years from now \u2013 and again, these are just estimates. But based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000, five years now, 30,000 Fusion customers plus 100,000 NetSuite customers bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. All right. So what's happening? I mean how are we winning so many new customers? Where are they coming from? Who are we competing? Well, we have \u2013 really we only have two significant competitors. We have two significant competitors, SAP and Workday. I've said this before. SAP did not build a true cloud product, and I'm going to explain what a true cloud product is in just a minute. But SAP, because they didn't build the cloud product, they bought some edge products around the cloud, but they didn't actually rebuild their software for the cloud. That's the same old 35-year-old software they've been selling forever. Their goal is simply to hold on to their installed base, but they are losing customers to us. For example, this quarter Petronas, oil and gas \u2013 big oil and gas customer moved over. I gave a long presentation about a couple of us taking already a couple of hundred pretty good-sized SAP customers. So we are doing very well against SAP and continue to do it well SAP, winning Petronas and others this quarter. But Workday is very interesting because Workday does have a cloud product. And they've done quite well in HCM, but they have very few live. Try to go out and find live Workday ERP customers. Try to find any. So we're winning almost everything in cloud ERP. We are beating Workday 90 \u2013 I don't know, 98% of the time, we beat Workday and we are taking customers from SAP's installed base. They are still holding on to more of their base than we are taking, but we are making inroads. So again, what's going on? Why are we winning? Well, we are winning because we have a true cloud product that is very, very feature-rich and Burberry has a very low cost of ownership. So it's enormously capable, and it's not expensive compared with the old on-premise systems. Our implementations, I mean we've got implementations of medium, large companies that sometimes take six months. Now don't get me wrong. Someone like Bank of America took a few years. That was an SAP customer that we won. And that was just doing the Merrill Lynch division. It took a few years. And then hopefully, we are going to continue to make progress at Bank of America. So in general, it's much faster and lower cost to implement our cloud product than implement, let's say, SAP or even Workday, but a gigantic difference was SAP. Very easy to use. We have the user interface. There is two aspects. There's the computer interface that works on mobile phones and tablets and things like that. And then we have a voice digital assistant. You talk to our applications. You talk to all of our applications. You ask for reports. You ask questions. And I think it's like Alexa for the enterprise. All our apps run on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every app. Not a handful of apps are mobile, every single app runs on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every single app has a voice interface. And this is what I mean by a true cloud product. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers for Fusion every three months. That's right. They get a new version with sometime hundreds or sometimes even thousands of new features. Every three months, they get that. Now why is that important? Well, I mean because our customers want \u2013 specifically in different industry, they don't all want the same new feature depending on the industry you're in, depending on your size, depending on the country you're in, your three most important new features you must have are different among a lot of different customers. So in the old days with SAP, customers built this themselves. They went out and hired Accenture or somebody else, IBM Services when it was IBM Services to build these features for them. Now the new model is \u2013 it don't customize your product. You don't have to. Give us your list of new features that you need and we'll build them and put them in the next release, and we can build them faster than you can. And you might have to wait three months or four months or five months before you get a new version. But you get them quickly, and we are the ones that build them. And they are part of the standard product. They are not some customization you have to maintain forever. So they're not expensive. In fact, they're free. They come with the product. This is radically different than what SAP offers in their and what they call their cloud product, which I say is not a true cloud product because they don't have new versions every three months. They don't have new versions every three years in their so-called cloud product. You make all the same modifications you used to make by hiring people and customize. That's not the new model. That's not how it works in a real cloud system. That's a fundamental and every time they go in and modify the system, what if they make a mistake? What if they have a bug? That's going to make the system less reliable and more expensive, potentially slower. That doesn't happen with real cloud systems. We, the vendor, are responsible for enhancing it and testing it on a regular cadence and responding to their requirements and delivering things to them in months, not years. We are also on schedule to deliver some unprecedented new technology. We won't be long before when our customers upgrade every three months, they upgrade. And sometimes they are down for an hour or so, and we are on schedule to deliver zero downtime upgrades. So it won't be long now when our customers move to the new version, there will be no downtime. Nobody else has this. Nobody else is working on. And soon all of our applications will be on the autonomous self-tuning Maximum Security database. I've said this before, what's the most important thing about the Autonomous Database? The money you save because there's no human labor. No actually, the money is good \u2013 the money you have to save is no human labor is good. But no human labor, no human errors, no security risks, no stolen data. Almost all of the \u2013 not all, but almost all of the data that's been hacked out of other clouds has been hacked because some human being made a mistake, left a port open, created a vulnerability. You can't do that with the Autonomous Database because human beings don't touch it. It\u2019s just like a self-driving car is safer than a car driven by human being, a self-driving database is much safer and more secure than a database that is managed by human beings who make mistakes and cause problems. Okay. So I'll stop there and I\u2019m going to slightly turn a little bit and describe what's going on in the marketplace kind of on an, in from an industry perspective. Fusion ERP has been out for a while, and we are beginning to roll up entire industries. We are adding the features for banking. I think on an earlier quarterly call, I said our two largest and most \u2013 strategic industries going forward in ERP would be banking and healthcare. Maybe not just ERP, but for the company in total will be banking and healthcare, and we are doing extremely well in those industries. Some of our live banking and financial service customers include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, State Street, NatWest, Santander, Macquarie. I can go on and on and on with a long list of banks all over the world. But also we have insurance customers, USAA, Nationwide, AAA and again and a lot more. I'm not going to list everybody. In fact, we provide a printed list at the end of every quarter of our all the new wins we had in the quarter. And we had a lot of new logos in banking and financial services in Q2. We won Barclays. That was another big bank that we won. First Bank, in insurance. We won Ameritas, MoneyGram. And we had some major go-lives, huge go-lives at MetLife, Blackstone and Assurant. We are doing very well in financial services and specifically banking. Healthcare, the other industry I identified as being strategic and above the \u2013 and on par with banking in terms of the importance to our future. So large healthcare customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Providence Saint Joe. I would say that we have a lot of healthcare wins around the world, but I'd say our healthcare wins are concentrated more in North America as compared with banking. New healthcare wins this quarter: Mayo Clinic, the number one ranked hospital in the United States, [Tay Markel], Syneos Health and PPD. Again, I can go on and on, but again, we print those out for you, and you can read them at your leisure. Let me talk about one other industry before I give my closing remarks. That's logistics customers. We've become very, very strong with logistics customers. FedEx was a key win from us, takeaway from SAP. UPS, we have UPS, DHL, FedEx, DP World, SS, TTS. I can go on and on. We have most of the big logistics companies around the world. And FedEx, which is \u2013 a lot of our companies aren't through rolling out Oracle Fusion ERP. But FedEx, for example, is now live in 98 countries. We are winning in lots of other industries as well, but I wanted to highlight these three industries because they are essential to our plan to add major new capabilities to our cloud ERP system. Before I describe these capabilities, I have a confession to make. We are not \u2013 I don't believe it anyway. We are not on our way to building a $20 billion cloud ERP business in five years. I think it's going to be a lot bigger than that. Let me explain why. As more and more companies adopt and run Oracle Cloud ERP, I ask the question, what does a B2B procurement transaction look like? In other words, how does it work when one Oracle Cloud ERP system is talking to another Oracle Cloud ERP system and placing an order? We are working in concert with our banking and logistics partners to originate purchase financing, products shipped, delivery tracking, invoicing and payments right inside the two transacting Oracle Cloud ERP procurement systems. Oracle Cloud ERP will soon bring an entirely new level of automation to B2B commerce, one that very much resembles the ease of doing business and efficiency of B2C e-commerce. This new ERP automation system, all these new capabilities will dramatically simplify our customers' procurement and supply chain processes. And as such, it represents a huge new opportunity for Oracle to grow its cloud ERP ecosystems. Thank you. Back to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Larry. I think Ken is going to take questions. So...\nKen Bond: Yes. Erica, if you could queue the audience, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter with accelerating growth. Larry, you shared quite a bit with us, really, really helpful. But I wanted to ask you about OCI because we continue to hear great things from customers. And I think people understand Oracle's cloud is hypersecure, highly automated, and there's real price performance advantage. But as we think about your product road map and what it takes for Oracle to capture more than its fair share of the broader public cloud market, how much are you investing in breadth versus depth? Because we just see in this quarter alone, like the partnership with Airtel in India, Orange in West Africa, new regions in Singapore, UAE, France, and I'm probably missing some. But clearly there's demand. Otherwise, I know Safra wouldn't be making these investments. But when a new competitor posts \u2013 Larry, when your main competitor posts over 200 services up the stack, how far should we expect to see you build up the stack competing on functionality versus continuing to go broad with what you already have? Thanks.\nLawrence Ellison: Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So \u2013 but I know you want to talk about this. Yes, you want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as two separate businesses, but of course, they're not. I mean everyone who is running Oracle ERP is building data warehouses on top of their ERP data. They're mashing it up maybe with Salesforce data. They're doing all of these things. They're doing a combination of big application customers. Bank of America, for example, is doing a combination of running our apps and building bespoke apps around those. So this is a huge opportunity for us that are other infrastructure customers, other infrastructure providers don't have. We've often had the discussion, do we want to support 10 databases, or do we want to support 30 databases? And do we want to have every single service that let's say an Amazon has? And I think our view is we want to have some really good choices, but not every single choice on the menu. We want to have all of the popular databases, but not some of the obscure databases. So we are not going to try to feature match every single thing they do. We will, however, have development environments they don't have at all. So if you're building data warehouses on top of Fusion ERP or on top of Fusion HCM or on top of NetSuite, we have a whole set of tools that makes that easy for you over on the infrastructure side of our business. So we have some \u2013 we do \u2013 we have all the popular stuff around. I mean obviously, you have Kubernetes and the like. And we have Postgres and the popular databases. We have MySQL, but our version of MySQL is much better than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's much faster. I mean more than 10x faster because of HeatWave. We have this Query Optimizer, they don't have at all. So our idea is to look at the most popular products to have recommended development environments and recommended systems, and be able to do things they can't do at all. I think one other \u2013 let me mention one of these fundamental differences in our strategy versus their strategy. They are building a small number of very, very large data centers. Our strategy is to build a large number of smaller, less expensive data centers. We think that improves reliability dramatically. We don't have this giant data center going down. It reduces the blast radius of what happens when things go down. Less goes down. It allows us to go into sovereign nations in some smaller countries that they can't \u2013 never afford to put a data center in. And we could not put one, but two, a primary and a backup data center in sovereign countries that care about data sovereignty. We can put a complete cloud. I don't mean just database cloud. I mean a complete cloud at a customer like NRI in Japan. And we did that with that \u2013 we put in a primary and a backup. So we can \u2013 if people want to run a cloud, if a large financial institution wants to run our cloud inside their firewall, inside their data center, we can do that. And how will that cloud differ from the cloud that we run in the public? It won't differ at all. We can make that small enough, that we can fit it into their data center. Nobody else can do this. So we think \u2013 and then let me close with a note that I'm going to paraphrase from a very large telecommunications company who uses our cloud and all the other three North American clouds, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. And the note basically said, the one thing we've noticed about Oracle, Oracle\u2019s Cloud is that it never ever goes down. We can't say that about any of the other clouds. We think this is a critical differentiator availability. Another critical differentiator is security, where we have \u2013 where the only way you can achieve security, I promise you this is true, is through autonomy. If you have human beings deploying and tinkering with your systems, they can make mistakes that expose your data. The only way we've been able to solve that problem is to get human beings out of the equation. No human beings, no human error, no human malice. So we think we have a bunch of differentiators. And we'll be able to compete very, very effectively with security, reliability, combination of apps and infrastructure autonomy and a bunch of other things the other guys just will not be able to do.\nBrad Zelnick: Larry, that's super helpful. Thank you, again and congrats.\nLawrence Ellison: I will not have an answer that long again, ever.\nSafra Catz: Brad, you're not going to believe this, I've got more to add to that answer. So first of all, you missed a few data centers, not the least of which is Israel, France and another one in Italy. But the real answer is the fact that I'm sure you've seen Gartner's scorecard where we actually passed Google this year and are higher than where Microsoft, who's been in this longer than us, was a year ago. But in addition, that scorecard doesn't even measure the capabilities we have in handling very large databases which, of course, we do uniquely of all the other hyperscalers. So it's all very interesting, but we have things in addition to applications in the infrastructure world that they cannot handle. And that has just put us in an incredible position, and that's why customers are coming to us. All right, I will stop right there.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats from me as well. I wanted to go back to ERP, and I apologize for that. But I remember when I used to work in the industry, Larry, the changing an ERP system was like volunteering for root canal treatment. Kind of, you kind of try to avoid it as much as possible. But if I look at the numbers now, NetSuite had the strongest role I've seen for forever, I think. Fusion ERP is accelerating. So what's going on in the industry in terms of kind of like the pressure or the willingness to do it now? Thanks for that, and congrats again.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes, thank you very much. I think we spend a lot of time in automating our install. Installing the product, making it very easy to configure, having \u2013 I think our consulting infrastructure, the implementers around our products now are much more experienced. The products have gotten much better. The people have got more experienced. The customers themselves have gotten more experienced. So the cost of putting one of these things in has dropped precipitously. The time it takes to put it in, obviously related to the cost has also dropped precipitously. There's just no comparison to the way it used to be to the way it is now. Well, the way it used to be a customer bought his own unique computer configuration and added some modifications to the ERP system and installed it over a period of \u2013 I mean, it wasn't unusual back in the day for an SAP implementation to take five to seven years. I know it sounds crazy, but some of them cost billions, billions of dollars. Now for a medium-sized company, six months is not unreasonable to get you live on \u2013 maybe not your entire business, but financials and procurement and a big chunk of your business, we can get live very, very quickly at a very, very low cost. So it's just a totally different world. And then the other thing I'm going to mention one more time. Customers are not encouraged to go ahead and build their own extensions. If you need an extension, tell us what you need, and maybe we can schedule it in the next quarter or two in the upcoming releases. That's a fundamentally different model. It's so much less expensive to have us do it for nothing, than to try to do it yourself.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys, and really impressive quarter. I think Brad had a really good point earlier that investors are more and more looking at sort of your CapEx intentions and looking at data center count, frankly, as a leading indicator of growth for Oracle. So I was hoping you could update us on that. And maybe digging into that data center side, capacity expansion isn't just in data center expansion. You could expand within data centers as well. Can you help us think about how we should think about overall capacity to deliver through both data center expansion and expanding those existing data centers to really capture all of these investments that you're making?\nSafra Catz: I guess I'll take that. I'll get started with that. Well, first of all, the public database data centers are the ones that we announced that are up and running. Of course, we have many in the offing. We also have, as Larry talked about, a private region for certain customers. But in addition, we've made very significant investment in government, especially United States government-focused data centers. And I'm sure you've seen that we've been invited to submit for the JWCC. We also have data centers at different levels of security for different government requirements in other countries. And those, we don't generally announce, so you don't see those. What you do see is the fact that we have invested ahead of revenue and we invest when we see revenue potential. We have been rolling out on track. So we feel very good about it. We have just continued to make sure we have capacity for customers. And some customers start in one data center, and when we open in their countries, they move to those. And that's working out for us. We have a lot of demand worldwide where you're going to see us make these investments, as I've guided for the whole year.\nKeith Weiss: Okay. Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much. I'm going to follow-up on the discussion on OCI Gen 2. Oracle's dedicated regions seem to be reasonably unique offerings and a different spin on the hybrid cloud, which the largest hyperscale providers are not offering. Can you explain how you're able to deliver this successfully with good margins, and why others cannot? And can you give us any sense of how large do you see that opportunity? Thanks.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes, I'll take a crack at that one. Well, everyone says we\u2019re late to the party. So we saw what everyone else built. In fact, we built two versions of our cloud, right? We built Version 1, which we weren't very happy with and then we built our Gen 2 cloud. And one of the things that we decided, as we had a chance to re-architect it, we were sensitive to \u2013 we needed special super high security zones for government. We need to build a lot of data centers. And the magic to building a lot of data centers is twofold. One is compressing the software to a smallish number of servers. But that's really not it. It's really the art of being able to operate a lot of smaller data centers without people or with very few people. Think about what Elon Musk did with his satellite system. Why was he able to build a low earth orbiting satellite system, and nobody else? And a lot of other people have tried, but no one else could. Because he figured it out \u2013 he built the software to manage thousands of satellites. No one else could do it. NASA couldn't do it. Other people couldn't do it. That's why they kind of failed in the past. Our automation software for rolling out and managing a large number of data centers is very different software that you would build for managing a small number of super large data center where you had a lot of people. So we've relied much more heavily on automation to do this. And Safra knows all about it because it wasn't easy. It took us a while. And we were worried a bit and we've made a bunch of commitments. And the only way we can meet all those commitments was to have fully automated lights-out data center, cloud data centers. And we \u2013 the team did a fantastic job prioritizing that automation. And that automation software is what allows us to have a large number of data centers rather than a small number of large data centers. It's just a different \u2013 it's a different suite of software to do it, to manage it.\nMark Moerdler: That makes a lot of sense.\nSafra Catz: Larry, I want to comment also on the private data centers that are truly a full cloud, but at customers. So that's just...\nLawrence Ellison: Yes, a lot of people talk about \u2013 they talk about \u2013 I think its hilarious. I hear people talk about hybrid cloud. So a hybrid cloud means there's someone's public cloud. And then whatever you have in your data center is the hybrid. This is ridiculous. That's not a cloud. People say, well, that's the most common cloud there is, whatever you got plus some link to a public cloud. That is not a hybrid cloud. We offer identical hardware, the identical automation software. We'll put a region. It runs all of our apps, it runs all of our services, 100% of them. And we'll put it in your data center. We can do that now because we can run that \u2013 we have the automation software to run that on your floor behind your firewall. We can build that. So it's true. So our notion of a hybrid cloud is basically the same thing, but it's located on your data center floor behind your firewall with high-speed network interconnects where you're comfortable and feel safe, safer than if you were in the public cloud. That's the only hybridy thing about it. Otherwise, it's exactly the same thing. You can move a workload from a public cloud into your private region and then back out of your private region back in the public cloud. They are identical in every way except for the security protection and some firewalls in your private data center. That's a real hybrid cloud. The other guys don't have it.\nMark Moerdler: That makes a lot of sense. I really do appreciate it and congratulations on the strong quarter.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. In a quarter where a lot of numbers jumped out, I mean, the one that jumped out to me the most was the license growth year-over-year. I had to go back nine years to my model to find a quarter that was actually higher than this. And obviously, when I think about license for Oracle, I was assuming its being driven by the database business. And then when you think about that\u2026\nLawrence Ellison: By the way, I'm really glad you said that. That's what it is. I mean think about it. I mean Marc Benioff over at Salesforce.com, they run their business, their cloud business entirely on Oracle. Now people say, well, that's not cloud revenue. You just license that revenue. Well, it's the Oracle database running all of Salesforce's cloud. And we don't count \u2013 and you're right, we don't count that as cloud revenue. We count that as license revenue. But is that a modern cloud application? I think so. But again, the license stuff is being driven by the use of our database in some very large clouds.\nPhilip Winslow: That's great. That partially answers one of my questions. But when you think about that license and your example of the \u2013 for example, like Salesforce together with just the cloud services and the acceleration you see there, I mean just that overall business seem to accelerate during Q2 here and even versus Q1. And if we think about some of the other smaller competitors in the space, they've seen acceleration as well. So I guess what my question is there's seems to be something going on in the data world and the data infrastructure stack. And obviously when Oracle moves at your scale at these percentages, there definitely seems to be something going on. So what is that? And how do you think about the sustainability of those drivers?\nSafra Catz: Larry, it's either you or me. We're going to talk about data. I mean listen, this is not new news in that what is going on is getting insights from data, being able to capture large amounts of data, and analyzing it. And of course, that's coming and so much of it is in Oracle. We're the ones who can handle high performance, high reliability requirements. And the Oracle database continues to grow. But in addition, we have the other technologies that are also doing very well. Java continues to be incredibly strong, and it's leading application development environment. But remember, when people buy the Oracle database licenses, they can bring those to our cloud, and that's a very economical way to operate. And really, what's going on is huge amounts of data growing exponentially. And when it's important data, especially data you want to use for analysis, for data warehousing, for transactions, you're going to pick Oracle in nine times out of 10. And so this is great for us. And of course, as more businesses just digitize, this just draws more of our technology.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes. And I would say that as SAP moves their applications to S/4HANA in the cloud and they do what I call hosting and they call cloud. The vast majority of those SAP databases do not run HANA. Way over 95% of them still run Oracle. It's a big business for us, even when it migrates to the cloud. I mean Amazon has customers who have taken their Oracle database licenses, and they're running those Oracle database licenses in the cloud. So license does not mean on-premise, and license does not mean the cloud. It's a bit of a \u2013 it's a mixed bag, right? Some of that license revenue and most of the new license revenue is on its way to the cloud.\nPhilip Winslow: Great. Thank you, Larry.\nKen Bond: A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest-growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue grew 6% in constant currency, above the high-end of my guidance, with broad-based outperformance across the company. Q3 revenue growth looks like it will continue even higher, but let me save that for the guidance discussion. Earnings were also strong, with non-GAAP EPS $0.09 above the high-end of my constant currency guidance. We achieved this outperformance despite the U.S. dollar strengthening since I gave guidance, as we saw a currency headwind of nearly $100 million to revenue and $0.01 to EPS, so the USD results, which are excellent and above guidance are even stronger than they appear. Before I go through the numbers, though, I wanted to comment on what we are seeing in the market that is driving our accelerating revenue growth. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we have a highly differentiated strategy from our competitors where we are the only company able to offer the combination of applications and infrastructure in the cloud. We have best-of-breed capabilities in both infrastructure and apps like HR and ERP, but also a highly differentiated set of industry-specific cloud SaaS applications and of course, our second-generation cloud with Autonomous Database are unique in their performance, security and dependability. And because we have decades of experience in mission-critical systems, our customers can depend on us being up and available when they need us. Our unique capabilities are attracting customers, especially as they consider how to conduct their own digital transformation in the complex industries in which they compete. They want us to know as much about their business as they do, whether it's telco, financial services, utilities, retail and many others and to partner with them to modernize. Once a company thinks beyond simple dev test and other rudimentary cloud workloads and move their technology focus to mission-critical projects, they invariably turn to Oracle. Our focus on customer success is driving more references and new opportunities with both existing customers and with entirely new accounts. And of course, we ourselves are an Oracle Fusion full suite user, and I'm sure it is not lost on any of you and it's not lost on our prospects and customers that we are announcing our results nine days after the quarter closed because of our systems and their embedded processes. Okay. Back to the numbers. And from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues, when annualized are now $10.7 billion and grew 22%, with cloud bookings growing faster than our cloud revenue growth rate. And as a result, we expect cloud revenue will accelerate further and exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s, potentially higher. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3.1 billion, up 8% organically in constant currency and our highest growth rate in four years. Fusion apps were up 30% with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $4.9 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP up 35%, Fusion HCM up 25%, and NetSuite ERP up 28%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% and excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 50%. I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will continue to ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 86% in constant currency and total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 45%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services were up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.2 billion, up 16% amongst our very best quarters over the last 10 years and license growth was not dependent on any mega deals. We saw excellent performance in technology, our vertical businesses as well as North America and Latin American regions. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up 6% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and gross profit dollars grew 5% in constant currency. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to or better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year and the operating margin was 47%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, slightly higher than our base rate of 19% and earnings per share was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in constant currency. During the quarter, we recognized GAAP acquisition-related and other expenses totaling $4.7 billion, which substantially consisted of litigation-related charges that will not recur. They relate to a dispute that arose when we hired my former co-CEO in 2010. As a result of this one-time charge, GAAP net income was a negative $1.2 billion. The GAAP tax rate was 16.6% due to some discrete items and the GAAP loss was $0.46 per share. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $10.3 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $7.1 billion. Both results were negatively affected by the litigation charges I mentioned. Capital expenditures for the last four quarters were $3.1 billion, and CapEx for Q2 alone was $925 million and we are on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have nearly $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is nearly $8 billion, up slightly in constant currency from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments with gross deferred revenue growing 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $37.2 billion, up 11% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said so many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 77 million shares for a total of $7 billion. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 47% at an average price that's about half the current share price. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion. We've paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now the guidance. I'm going to start by reiterating our expectation that full-year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate from 2021 for all the reasons we've already seen so far this year. Given the strong performance in the first half, I now expect that we will see full-year total revenue finish solidly in the mid-single digits, led by cloud revenue growth exiting the year in the mid-20s. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise, and I expect that our operating margins this year will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. I know you all saw that. And assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which we have no idea if they will or not, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 3% for revenue and $0.05 for EPS in Q3. Total revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Clearly, the midpoint of the range is 7%, and that is higher than the 6% we just reported in Q2 and higher than the 2% we reported in Q1. So everything is trending in the right direction. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in constant currency and be between $1.19 and $1.23 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to grow between negative 2 and positive 2 in USD and be between $1.14 and $1.18 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Thanks, Larry. I think Ken is going to take questions. So... Brad, you're not going to believe this, I've got more to add to that answer. So first of all, you missed a few data centers, not the least of which is Israel, France and another one in Italy. But the real answer is the fact that I'm sure you've seen Gartner's scorecard where we actually passed Google this year and are higher than where Microsoft, who's been in this longer than us, was a year ago. But in addition, that scorecard doesn't even measure the capabilities we have in handling very large databases which, of course, we do uniquely of all the other hyperscalers. So it's all very interesting, but we have things in addition to applications in the infrastructure world that they cannot handle. And that has just put us in an incredible position, and that's why customers are coming to us. All right, I will stop right there. I guess I'll take that. I'll get started with that. Well, first of all, the public database data centers are the ones that we announced that are up and running. Of course, we have many in the offing. We also have, as Larry talked about, a private region for certain customers. But in addition, we've made very significant investment in government, especially United States government-focused data centers. And I'm sure you've seen that we've been invited to submit for the JWCC. We also have data centers at different levels of security for different government requirements in other countries. And those, we don't generally announce, so you don't see those. What you do see is the fact that we have invested ahead of revenue and we invest when we see revenue potential. We have been rolling out on track. So we feel very good about it. We have just continued to make sure we have capacity for customers. And some customers start in one data center, and when we open in their countries, they move to those. And that's working out for us. We have a lot of demand worldwide where you're going to see us make these investments, as I've guided for the whole year. Larry, I want to comment also on the private data centers that are truly a full cloud, but at customers. So that's just... Larry, it's either you or me. We're going to talk about data. I mean listen, this is not new news in that what is going on is getting insights from data, being able to capture large amounts of data, and analyzing it. And of course, that's coming and so much of it is in Oracle. We're the ones who can handle high performance, high reliability requirements. And the Oracle database continues to grow. But in addition, we have the other technologies that are also doing very well. Java continues to be incredibly strong, and it's leading application development environment. But remember, when people buy the Oracle database licenses, they can bring those to our cloud, and that's a very economical way to operate. And really, what's going on is huge amounts of data growing exponentially. And when it's important data, especially data you want to use for analysis, for data warehousing, for transactions, you're going to pick Oracle in nine times out of 10. And so this is great for us. And of course, as more businesses just digitize, this just draws more of our technology."

            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. All right, I'm going to discuss Oracle's Cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today? I mean a lot of the people \u2013 a lot of the companies like Microsoft did a great job of moving their entire Microsoft Office installed base into the cloud to dramatically increase the size of their cloud business. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same option or opportunity, so I think it's \u2013 to me, I think you are going to find this interesting. So how big is our on-premise business today? Well, we had 7,500 customers in Oracle on-premise, their ERP made up of E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Only 1,000 of those 7,500 have moved to Fusion Cloud ERP. Now we have not lost any of these customers to competitors. We expect all the remaining 6,500 to move to Fusion ERP, but it hasn't happened yet. That's all upside. That's all upside. And I think a lot of people don't really realize that how \u2013 so now let's migrate over and look at how big is our cloud ERP business today. Well, round number is $5 billion a year revenue, and we have 8,500 Fusion customers. But remember only 1,000 of those 8,500 came from our old on-premise business. 6,500, plenty to come. So 7,500 of these 8,500 were not running Oracle ERP before we came out with our cloud product. Those are all new customers. Add to that the 28,000 new NetSuite customers. So Oracle has a total of 35,500 cloud ERP customers that are new to Oracle. Only 1,000 of our on-premise installed base has migrated so far. Let me repeat that. 35,500 net new cloud ERP customers we got in the last few years. Only 1,000 from our installed base that's going to be coming to us later on. So how fast is cloud ERP revenue growing about? So growing about 30% a year. And so let's look out five years and ask the question, how big will we be in five years? And I think the number would be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating, our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base, they are coming from someone else's installed base. And again, yes \u2013 85% of our current \u2013 that we have are from someone else's installed base. So what are our margins in this five year? Let's say, we are estimating $20 billion cloud ERP business. Well, it's scale, at that scale, that's about an 85% margin in that business. And as Safra pointed out earlier in her comments, the cloud business is inherently much more profitable and much more predictable than our old on-premise business. So we expect five years from now \u2013 and again, these are just estimates. But based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000, five years now, 30,000 Fusion customers plus 100,000 NetSuite customers bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. All right. So what's happening? I mean how are we winning so many new customers? Where are they coming from? Who are we competing? Well, we have \u2013 really we only have two significant competitors. We have two significant competitors, SAP and Workday. I've said this before. SAP did not build a true cloud product, and I'm going to explain what a true cloud product is in just a minute. But SAP, because they didn't build the cloud product, they bought some edge products around the cloud, but they didn't actually rebuild their software for the cloud. That's the same old 35-year-old software they've been selling forever. Their goal is simply to hold on to their installed base, but they are losing customers to us. For example, this quarter Petronas, oil and gas \u2013 big oil and gas customer moved over. I gave a long presentation about a couple of us taking already a couple of hundred pretty good-sized SAP customers. So we are doing very well against SAP and continue to do it well SAP, winning Petronas and others this quarter. But Workday is very interesting because Workday does have a cloud product. And they've done quite well in HCM, but they have very few live. Try to go out and find live Workday ERP customers. Try to find any. So we're winning almost everything in cloud ERP. We are beating Workday 90 \u2013 I don't know, 98% of the time, we beat Workday and we are taking customers from SAP's installed base. They are still holding on to more of their base than we are taking, but we are making inroads. So again, what's going on? Why are we winning? Well, we are winning because we have a true cloud product that is very, very feature-rich and Burberry has a very low cost of ownership. So it's enormously capable, and it's not expensive compared with the old on-premise systems. Our implementations, I mean we've got implementations of medium, large companies that sometimes take six months. Now don't get me wrong. Someone like Bank of America took a few years. That was an SAP customer that we won. And that was just doing the Merrill Lynch division. It took a few years. And then hopefully, we are going to continue to make progress at Bank of America. So in general, it's much faster and lower cost to implement our cloud product than implement, let's say, SAP or even Workday, but a gigantic difference was SAP. Very easy to use. We have the user interface. There is two aspects. There's the computer interface that works on mobile phones and tablets and things like that. And then we have a voice digital assistant. You talk to our applications. You talk to all of our applications. You ask for reports. You ask questions. And I think it's like Alexa for the enterprise. All our apps run on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every app. Not a handful of apps are mobile, every single app runs on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every single app has a voice interface. And this is what I mean by a true cloud product. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers for Fusion every three months. That's right. They get a new version with sometime hundreds or sometimes even thousands of new features. Every three months, they get that. Now why is that important? Well, I mean because our customers want \u2013 specifically in different industry, they don't all want the same new feature depending on the industry you're in, depending on your size, depending on the country you're in, your three most important new features you must have are different among a lot of different customers. So in the old days with SAP, customers built this themselves. They went out and hired Accenture or somebody else, IBM Services when it was IBM Services to build these features for them. Now the new model is \u2013 it don't customize your product. You don't have to. Give us your list of new features that you need and we'll build them and put them in the next release, and we can build them faster than you can. And you might have to wait three months or four months or five months before you get a new version. But you get them quickly, and we are the ones that build them. And they are part of the standard product. They are not some customization you have to maintain forever. So they're not expensive. In fact, they're free. They come with the product. This is radically different than what SAP offers in their and what they call their cloud product, which I say is not a true cloud product because they don't have new versions every three months. They don't have new versions every three years in their so-called cloud product. You make all the same modifications you used to make by hiring people and customize. That's not the new model. That's not how it works in a real cloud system. That's a fundamental and every time they go in and modify the system, what if they make a mistake? What if they have a bug? That's going to make the system less reliable and more expensive, potentially slower. That doesn't happen with real cloud systems. We, the vendor, are responsible for enhancing it and testing it on a regular cadence and responding to their requirements and delivering things to them in months, not years. We are also on schedule to deliver some unprecedented new technology. We won't be long before when our customers upgrade every three months, they upgrade. And sometimes they are down for an hour or so, and we are on schedule to deliver zero downtime upgrades. So it won't be long now when our customers move to the new version, there will be no downtime. Nobody else has this. Nobody else is working on. And soon all of our applications will be on the autonomous self-tuning Maximum Security database. I've said this before, what's the most important thing about the Autonomous Database? The money you save because there's no human labor. No actually, the money is good \u2013 the money you have to save is no human labor is good. But no human labor, no human errors, no security risks, no stolen data. Almost all of the \u2013 not all, but almost all of the data that's been hacked out of other clouds has been hacked because some human being made a mistake, left a port open, created a vulnerability. You can't do that with the Autonomous Database because human beings don't touch it. It's just like a self-driving car is safer than a car driven by human being, a self-driving database is much safer and more secure than a database that is managed by human beings who make mistakes and cause problems. Okay. So I'll stop there and I'm going to slightly turn a little bit and describe what's going on in the marketplace kind of on an, in from an industry perspective. Fusion ERP has been out for a while, and we are beginning to roll up entire industries. We are adding the features for banking. I think on an earlier quarterly call, I said our two largest and most \u2013 strategic industries going forward in ERP would be banking and healthcare. Maybe not just ERP, but for the company in total will be banking and healthcare, and we are doing extremely well in those industries. Some of our live banking and financial service customers include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, State Street, NatWest, Santander, Macquarie. I can go on and on and on with a long list of banks all over the world. But also we have insurance customers, USAA, Nationwide, AAA and again and a lot more. I'm not going to list everybody. In fact, we provide a printed list at the end of every quarter of our all the new wins we had in the quarter. And we had a lot of new logos in banking and financial services in Q2. We won Barclays. That was another big bank that we won. First Bank, in insurance. We won Ameritas, MoneyGram. And we had some major go-lives, huge go-lives at MetLife, Blackstone and Assurant. We are doing very well in financial services and specifically banking. Healthcare, the other industry I identified as being strategic and above the \u2013 and on par with banking in terms of the importance to our future. So large healthcare customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Providence Saint Joe. I would say that we have a lot of healthcare wins around the world, but I'd say our healthcare wins are concentrated more in North America as compared with banking. New healthcare wins this quarter: Mayo Clinic, the number one ranked hospital in the United States, [Tay Markel], Syneos Health and PPD. Again, I can go on and on, but again, we print those out for you, and you can read them at your leisure. Let me talk about one other industry before I give my closing remarks. That's logistics customers. We've become very, very strong with logistics customers. FedEx was a key win from us, takeaway from SAP. UPS, we have UPS, DHL, FedEx, DP World, SS, TTS. I can go on and on. We have most of the big logistics companies around the world. And FedEx, which is \u2013 a lot of our companies aren't through rolling out Oracle Fusion ERP. But FedEx, for example, is now live in 98 countries. We are winning in lots of other industries as well, but I wanted to highlight these three industries because they are essential to our plan to add major new capabilities to our cloud ERP system. Before I describe these capabilities, I have a confession to make. We are not \u2013 I don't believe it anyway. We are not on our way to building a $20 billion cloud ERP business in five years. I think it's going to be a lot bigger than that. Let me explain why. As more and more companies adopt and run Oracle Cloud ERP, I ask the question, what does a B2B procurement transaction look like? In other words, how does it work when one Oracle Cloud ERP system is talking to another Oracle Cloud ERP system and placing an order? We are working in concert with our banking and logistics partners to originate purchase financing, products shipped, delivery tracking, invoicing and payments right inside the two transacting Oracle Cloud ERP procurement systems. Oracle Cloud ERP will soon bring an entirely new level of automation to B2B commerce, one that very much resembles the ease of doing business and efficiency of B2C e-commerce. This new ERP automation system, all these new capabilities will dramatically simplify our customers' procurement and supply chain processes. And as such, it represents a huge new opportunity for Oracle to grow its cloud ERP ecosystems. Thank you. Back to Safra. Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So \u2013 but I know you want to talk about this. Yes, you want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as two separate businesses, but of course, they're not. I mean everyone who is running Oracle ERP is building data warehouses on top of their ERP data. They're mashing it up maybe with Salesforce data. They're doing all of these things. They're doing a combination of big application customers. Bank of America, for example, is doing a combination of running our apps and building bespoke apps around those. So this is a huge opportunity for us that are other infrastructure customers, other infrastructure providers don't have. We've often had the discussion, do we want to support 10 databases, or do we want to support 30 databases? And do we want to have every single service that let's say an Amazon has? And I think our view is we want to have some really good choices, but not every single choice on the menu. We want to have all of the popular databases, but not some of the obscure databases. So we are not going to try to feature match every single thing they do. We will, however, have development environments they don't have at all. So if you're building data warehouses on top of Fusion ERP or on top of Fusion HCM or on top of NetSuite, we have a whole set of tools that makes that easy for you over on the infrastructure side of our business. So we have some \u2013 we do \u2013 we have all the popular stuff around. I mean obviously, you have Kubernetes and the like. And we have Postgres and the popular databases. We have MySQL, but our version of MySQL is much better than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's much faster. I mean more than 10x faster because of HeatWave. We have this Query Optimizer, they don't have at all. So our idea is to look at the most popular products to have recommended development environments and recommended systems, and be able to do things they can't do at all. I think one other \u2013 let me mention one of these fundamental differences in our strategy versus their strategy. They are building a small number of very, very large data centers. Our strategy is to build a large number of smaller, less expensive data centers. We think that improves reliability dramatically. We don't have this giant data center going down. It reduces the blast radius of what happens when things go down. Less goes down. It allows us to go into sovereign nations in some smaller countries that they can't \u2013 never afford to put a data center in. And we could not put one, but two, a primary and a backup data center in sovereign countries that care about data sovereignty. We can put a complete cloud. I don't mean just database cloud. I mean a complete cloud at a customer like NRI in Japan. And we did that with that \u2013 we put in a primary and a backup. So we can \u2013 if people want to run a cloud, if a large financial institution wants to run our cloud inside their firewall, inside their data center, we can do that. And how will that cloud differ from the cloud that we run in the public? It won't differ at all. We can make that small enough, that we can fit it into their data center. Nobody else can do this. So we think \u2013 and then let me close with a note that I'm going to paraphrase from a very large telecommunications company who uses our cloud and all the other three North American clouds, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. And the note basically said, the one thing we've noticed about Oracle, Oracle's Cloud is that it never ever goes down. We can't say that about any of the other clouds. We think this is a critical differentiator availability. Another critical differentiator is security, where we have \u2013 where the only way you can achieve security, I promise you this is true, is through autonomy. If you have human beings deploying and tinkering with your systems, they can make mistakes that expose your data. The only way we've been able to solve that problem is to get human beings out of the equation. No human beings, no human error, no human malice. So we think we have a bunch of differentiators. And we'll be able to compete very, very effectively with security, reliability, combination of apps and infrastructure autonomy and a bunch of other things the other guys just will not be able to do. I will not have an answer that long again, ever. Yes, thank you very much. I think we spend a lot of time in automating our install. Installing the product, making it very easy to configure, having \u2013 I think our consulting infrastructure, the implementers around our products now are much more experienced. The products have gotten much better. The people have got more experienced. The customers themselves have gotten more experienced. So the cost of putting one of these things in has dropped precipitously. The time it takes to put it in, obviously related to the cost has also dropped precipitously. There's just no comparison to the way it used to be to the way it is now. Well, the way it used to be a customer bought his own unique computer configuration and added some modifications to the ERP system and installed it over a period of \u2013 I mean, it wasn't unusual back in the day for an SAP implementation to take five to seven years. I know it sounds crazy, but some of them cost billions, billions of dollars. Now for a medium-sized company, six months is not unreasonable to get you live on \u2013 maybe not your entire business, but financials and procurement and a big chunk of your business, we can get live very, very quickly at a very, very low cost. So it's just a totally different world. And then the other thing I'm going to mention one more time. Customers are not encouraged to go ahead and build their own extensions. If you need an extension, tell us what you need, and maybe we can schedule it in the next quarter or two in the upcoming releases. That's a fundamentally different model. It's so much less expensive to have us do it for nothing, than to try to do it yourself. Yes, I'll take a crack at that one. Well, everyone says we're late to the party. So we saw what everyone else built. In fact, we built two versions of our cloud, right? We built Version 1, which we weren't very happy with and then we built our Gen 2 cloud. And one of the things that we decided, as we had a chance to re-architect it, we were sensitive to \u2013 we needed special super high security zones for government. We need to build a lot of data centers. And the magic to building a lot of data centers is twofold. One is compressing the software to a smallish number of servers. But that's really not it. It's really the art of being able to operate a lot of smaller data centers without people or with very few people. Think about what Elon Musk did with his satellite system. Why was he able to build a low earth orbiting satellite system, and nobody else? And a lot of other people have tried, but no one else could. Because he figured it out \u2013 he built the software to manage thousands of satellites. No one else could do it. NASA couldn't do it. Other people couldn't do it. That's why they kind of failed in the past. Our automation software for rolling out and managing a large number of data centers is very different software that you would build for managing a small number of super large data center where you had a lot of people. So we've relied much more heavily on automation to do this. And Safra knows all about it because it wasn't easy. It took us a while. And we were worried a bit and we've made a bunch of commitments. And the only way we can meet all those commitments was to have fully automated lights-out data center, cloud data centers. And we \u2013 the team did a fantastic job prioritizing that automation. And that automation software is what allows us to have a large number of data centers rather than a small number of large data centers. It's just a different \u2013 it's a different suite of software to do it, to manage it. Yes, a lot of people talk about \u2013 they talk about \u2013 I think its hilarious. I hear people talk about hybrid cloud. So a hybrid cloud means there's someone's public cloud. And then whatever you have in your data center is the hybrid. This is ridiculous. That's not a cloud. People say, well, that's the most common cloud there is, whatever you got plus some link to a public cloud. That is not a hybrid cloud. We offer identical hardware, the identical automation software. We'll put a region. It runs all of our apps, it runs all of our services, 100% of them. And we'll put it in your data center. We can do that now because we can run that \u2013 we have the automation software to run that on your floor behind your firewall. We can build that. So it's true. So our notion of a hybrid cloud is basically the same thing, but it's located on your data center floor behind your firewall with high-speed network interconnects where you're comfortable and feel safe, safer than if you were in the public cloud. That's the only hybridy thing about it. Otherwise, it's exactly the same thing. You can move a workload from a public cloud into your private region and then back out of your private region back in the public cloud. They are identical in every way except for the security protection and some firewalls in your private data center. That's a real hybrid cloud. The other guys don't have it. Thank you. By the way, I'm really glad you said that. That's what it is. I mean think about it. I mean Marc Benioff over at Salesforce.com, they run their business, their cloud business entirely on Oracle. Now people say, well, that's not cloud revenue. You just license that revenue. Well, it's the Oracle database running all of Salesforce's cloud. And we don't count \u2013 and you're right, we don't count that as cloud revenue. We count that as license revenue. But is that a modern cloud application? I think so. But again, the license stuff is being driven by the use of our database in some very large clouds. Yes. And I would say that as SAP moves their applications to S/4HANA in the cloud and they do what I call hosting and they call cloud. The vast majority of those SAP databases do not run HANA. Way over 95% of them still run Oracle. It's a big business for us, even when it migrates to the cloud. I mean Amazon has customers who have taken their Oracle database licenses, and they're running those Oracle database licenses in the cloud. So license does not mean on-premise, and license does not mean the cloud. It's a bit of a \u2013 it's a mixed bag, right? Some of that license revenue and most of the new license revenue is on its way to the cloud."

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was $100 million above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance. As the dollar strengthened from when I gave guidance and it strengthened significantly, we didn't get the benefit we would have gotten had it stayed at the same level throughout the quarter. Now from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and accounted for 76% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues are now at an annualized revenue of $10 billion with an accelerating growth rate that we expect will exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 7% with Fusion apps up 26% in USD and 24% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office applications grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 30% and NetSuite ERP, up 26%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 3%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew in the mid-30s, and we saw triple-digit booking growth this quarter. So I expect the infrastructure revenue growth will ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 80% in constant currency and Cloud at Customer revenue was up 44%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and that's up from 4% last quarter. License revenues were $813 million, down 8% after a tough compare from last year's Q1. So all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.7 billion, up 4% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 2%. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 2% from last year, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, slightly below our base tax rate of 19%, and earnings per share was US$1.03, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. As a result of some discrete items, the GAAP tax rate was 8.4%, and GAAP EPS was US$0.86, which was up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $15.3 billion, up 17% in USD, and our free cash flow over the same period was $12.6 billion, up 9% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, also over the same period. CapEx for Q1 alone was $1.1 billion. We now have more than $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10 billion, up 1% from a year-ago due to timing differences in customer payments, but with gross deferred revenue up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO, our balance is $38.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency, due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares for a total of $8 billion. And over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 46% and in average price, that's about half the current share price. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to guidance what you are all waiting for. I remain highly confident that fiscal year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate because our fast-growing cloud businesses are becoming a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue growth for fiscal year 2022, which is the one we\u2019re in, somewhere in the mid-single digits in constant currency and accelerating. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect company operating margins will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2. And I will review this on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a very minor positive effect on total revenue and EPS in Q2. Total revenue for Q2 are expected to grow between 3% to 5% in both USD and constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenue for Q2 are expected to grow more than 5% in both USD and constant currency and then climb higher through the second half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in both USD and constant currency and be between $1.09 and $1.13. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary both up and down, but I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our non-GAAP tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLawrence Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Oracle Cloud business, infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year. Oracle and NetSuite were pioneers in cloud application. Oracle and NetSuite being the very first cloud company of any kind. Several years later, Amazon launched the very first cloud infrastructure company. Oracle Fusion ERP has over 8,000 cloud customers. NetSuite ERP has over 28,000 cloud applications customers. Oracle is the overwhelming market leader in the global cloud ERP market. Oracle Cloud ERP is currently used by many of the largest, most complex companies on Earth. This past quarter, in Q1, a company I couldn't name until now, major portion of Bank of America went live on Oracle Fusion ERP consolidating ledgers in 33 separate countries into one global cloud ledger. Also in Q1, another huge bank, Macquarie, the largest investment bank in Australia went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Also in Q1, Vanguard, the largest global mutual fund provider went live with Oracle Fusion ERP, not just in Q1. Oracle Fusion is building a very strong position in the world's largest financial services company. HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, they are all live on Oracle's Fusion applications. We have started working with our strategic partners and banking to develop a new generation of cloud B2B financing and payment systems. There are things you can do on the cloud you could never do on-premise. There are opportunities in the cloud. If you are the largest ERP supplier, there are opportunities to go into new businesses like financing and payments with banking partners that would have been impossible with the old on-premise systems, and those are opportunities we are aggressively pursuing with the world's money center banks. Banking and healthcare will be Oracle's two largest verticals going forward. Speaking of healthcare, Humana was an important Fusion ERP win in Q1. In the infrastructure part of our cloud business, we continue to innovate in several technical areas. We have made great progress and we are now on our way into the big four global hyperscalers, and I'll give you a list of those in case you don't know. They are Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Google, note the order. I was not the one who sorted that list. Oracle has come a long way in the cloud infrastructure business. Our technology is getting really good and very competitive. And of course, we continue to deliver breakthrough innovations in areas where we have long been strongest like database. The Oracle Database remains unrivaled and running the world's biggest and most critical systems. And our other database, the open-source system, MySQL, is now on a new generation, and it now includes an ultra-high performance in-memory query processor called HeatWave, plus a new set of management tools called the AutoPilot. Amazon's version of MySQL, again MySQL is an open-source database, anyone can have it. Amazon took the version of MySQL renamed it Aurora and put it up in AWS. Now, the open-source version of MySQL, the old version of MySQL pre-HeatWave is very, very slow with query processing. In fact, the way you use Aurora typically in Amazon over the years is you do your transaction processing in Aurora, also known as MySQL. And then when you do your query processing, you moved your data out of Amazon's MySQL on to Aurora and put into a thing called RedShift, a data warehouse system from Amazon. Recently, SnowFlake has come up with a data warehouse that runs at AWS and SnowFlake competing quite effectively against RedShift because SnowFlake runs on multiple clouds, and SnowFlake like RedShift is way faster at queries than the old MySQL or Aurora. Okay. So Oracle introduces this new version of MySQL, this new generation of MySQL with HeatWave. And the customer reaction has been stupendous simply for the reason that over and over again, they measure Oracle's MySQL to be 100x faster than Amazon's Aurora for query processing. Now, this was actually not unexpected. The old MySQL, which is Aurora, that's what Aurora is, the old MySQL, it's terrible for query processing. What was unexpected is that Oracle MySQL proved to be more than 10x faster than Amazon RedShift or SnowFlake for query processing. So suddenly, there is one database, you can do transaction \u2013 one open-source database, you can do transaction processing on, MySQL with HeatWave. And that same database, MySQL with HeatWave is the fastest place to run your queries. So you don't need to move your data into RedShift or SnowFlake anymore just to do query. This is excited so many customers that they asked us over and over again. We made it available this quarter Oracle's MySQL with HeatWave is available at the Oracle Public Cloud, but they asked if we would make it available on other public clouds. And we thought that's what our customers want, that's what we are going to do. So we plan to make Oracle MySQL with HeatWave available on other public clouds in addition to the Oracle Public Cloud and compete aggressively where we have huge technical advantages over Amazon Aurora, Amazon RedShift and perhaps most interestingly, huge technical advantages, performance and cost over SnowFlake. I'll turn it back to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Larry. Ken, I think we're ready to take questions.\nKen Bond: Yes, absolutely. Erica, if you could please prepare the audience for questions, please.\nOperator:  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you, and congrats from me as well, and especially on the RPO disclosure and growth there. My question is around Fusion and NetSuite. We obviously are in a somewhat recovery scenario. And I'm looking at your professional services as well, which is kind of very strong there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in terms of people wanting to do now that they're coming out of the pandemic, more around digital transformation and hence you had actually an extra boost on demand despite what you saw already beforehand? Or how do we have to think about the dynamic there? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Raimo, maybe I'll start and then Larry can add in. I think that one of the things has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data, that capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented, your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud, and also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID. And there is no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked and I think it's our third year in a row in the top right-hand quadrant on Gartner really with no one even close to us, we are the number one choice for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there is just incredible momentum and commitment from our \u2013 from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise either with our products or historically with SAP where they just can't continue like they did.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes, I'll add. Your question about services, we have pretty much made the migration away from on-premise implementations where all of our staff is focused on cloud implementations. And during that transition, every time we go through one of these transitions, it looks like something isn't growing or worse yet something is shrinking. Well, in this case, the on-premise stuff went down until it almost went away. And basically all of the implementation services you see for applications are cloud implementations. We've now made the migration and that should just grow steadily as demand for those systems increases. We really don't have a lot of competition. That's the understatement of the year in cloud ERP. I'd love to know who the competitors are. SAP doesn't have a product. When we \u2013 we're in a competition with the SAP right now and we've just gotten \u2013 we just found out, we're vendor of choice and their big thing was SAP doesn't have a cloud product. They have hosting. They're willing to put a custom computer in Amazon and just build a specialized version for the customer. That's not the cloud. We update our applications every three months, the entire fleet of 8,000 Fusion customers are updated every three months. The entire fleet of 28,000 NetSuite customers are updated every six months. You get SAP, they install it and then they probably will update it again five years now. It's an on-premise system. They don't have a cloud system. We're winning every deal against them, everyone, and we're taking a lot of their customers away.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my questions, and congratulations on the size and strength of the IaaS plus SaaS cloud. OCI Gen 2 passed Google GCP in the Gartner IaaS/PaaS feature functionality ranking this month. Let me ask, is the functionality checkbox enough to capture market or do you believe that customers fundamentally view OCI different than AWS, Azure and GCP and why? Thanks.\nLawrence Ellison: Well, I think the big question was, I think, the big issue that remains open about Oracle \u2013 I would say, it probably still remains open about Oracle is can Oracle compete with database against Amazon? It's interesting question because Amazon doesn't really have it. Well, Amazon has like 13 separate databases where the Oracle data, we do everything in a single database. We don't think an application should talk to five or six separate databases. We think it's a very risky security architecture. But the question is Amazon is the big leader in cloud. We're the big leader in databases. Well, if forced to choose, will they pick the Amazon Cloud and a database other than the Oracle Database? And - or are they willing to move to migrate their Oracle applications to the Oracle Cloud to get the Oracle \u2013 all the security and performance advantages of the Oracle Database? That\u2019s been the big question out there. And with our cloud good enough to compete with Amazon and Google and Microsoft, and I think we have answered those questions. It's not only good enough to compete. It\u2019s - in many cases, it's much better for security, for performance, for reliability, for cost, we're cheaper. And that's one of the reasons we have such a big ISV business. And so many people have left Amazon and come to the Oracle Cloud was because we cost less. So we have significant cost advantages. And I think this is another big step to proving that the Oracle Cloud is part of the big four. It's not a big three. It's a big four. I'm not including the Chinese players because they're regional or not global. I'm counting the Gartner sequence and the Gartner sequence is Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, Google. And if we're in the big four and virtually every important database application on Earth runs \u2013 I mean, not everyone, but the vast majority run on the Oracle Database. If those migrate to the Oracle Cloud, we have a very, very large business, and we're seeing people moving more and more things to the Oracle Cloud. Now in this Gartner report, we will just help \u2013 we'll move that along quite nicely.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nLawrence Ellison: By the way, it's not just the Gartner report. If they come and look and they run, if they do a comparison, a straighter comparison us, Google, us, Amazon, they test the application in both places. We win all of those. It's when they don't come and look that we have a problem.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Erica, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Safra, nice job at accelerating recurring revenue growth, while still growing operating income in Q1. Last quarter, you had alluded to the fiscal 2022 being more of an investment year for you guys. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about balancing topline growth versus operating income growth or operating margins for the fiscal year and maybe touch on where you want to be adding more investments to help with accelerating growth either from a geo perspective or a product go-to-market standpoint?\nSafra Catz: Well, you and your colleagues have been following Oracle for a long time and you know that when we talk about investing, we still focus on increasing profitability, okay. We're not like many of these other companies that when they invest, they lose money or they don't make more money. We will make more money this year, while investing and accelerating than we did before. So that's our expectation is we don't have to pick. We've never believed we have to pick because we have differentiated products that are very high value. You know how we run the company. We don't waste money. We spend it on things that bring returns, and we're very careful about that, but we have so much demand worldwide right now for really our cloud product lines pretty much across the Board, whether it's our Database Services, our Cloud at Customer, our OCI Gen 2, our Fusion products, it's just such a great time that even though we're going to invest more, we will make more. And so we just don't think you have to pick one or the other. It's just a matter of \u2013 this is an important time for us to invest, but we're going to make more money.\nLawrence Ellison: Yes, I'd like to just second that with an example in the past, recent history where when we bought NetSuite, we considered NetSuite strategic. We thought this is a company that it should be growing even faster than it was independently as a part of Oracle. And so we made a number of investments in NetSuite, and we've seen their growth \u2013 NetSuite has gotten bigger obviously, but their growth rate has increased and we've invested, but we've made more money and we're growing faster in NetSuite. So I think that's the model that Safra likes to implement. And it seems to be working pretty well at NetSuite. We don't see why it would be any different in a larger business like the Oracle Public Cloud.\nDerrick Wood: Understood. Thanks for the color.\nKen Bond: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much, and thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess Larry, can you sort of double click on OCI and specifically, I was curious what you're seeing with some of your early OCI customers in terms of net expansion, meaning how are those customers growing with you in terms of either net workloads or new infrastructure services? And within those customers, do you feel like you're taking wallet share versus some of the other public vendors? Just to give us a sense on how those might act as a proxy for others? Thanks.\nLawrence Ellison: Absolutely. We have corporate customers. They've been with us for a while that are expanding. Maybe the most interesting thing about this is, are the ISVs because the ISVs, I mean they are in the cloud business. I mean, that's their whole business. They run \u2013 their primary expense is running their cloud operations. And when a number of those companies move from Amazon to Oracle, I mean, I'll give you a bunch of examples, then they really take a close look at the economics of what they're doing the reliability of the system. Zoom is a famous example, but there are a bunch of other ISV examples of companies that have moved from Amazon to Oracle. So that is really very encouraging. But we're seeing it now in our corporate customers as well. They move a workload. That works, they wait. They move in two or three more workloads. That\u2019s continuing. So we think again, as Gartner report is one more step in the right direction in terms of encouraging our corporate customers to move even more workloads and accelerate the rate. But have we seen a pattern? Yes. We move a workload for a customer, and move a second workload to third workload. Once they understand, it works smoothly and the economics are advantageous. They just move more workloads on a continuous basis and that's what we are experiencing.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nKen Bond: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Turits with KeyBanc.\nMichael Turits: Hey, Larry and Safra. I wanted to ask about Cloud at Customer. I think you mentioned, Safra, it's growing 40%. So what tailwinds and if there are any headwinds is this Cloud at Customer seeing. And is that now able to start driving sustainable database acceleration beyond the acceleration that you saw this quarter?\nSafra Catz: Yes, I mean, one of the things I didn't mention was that consumption at Cloud at Customer is up over 150%. So you need to understand that once Cloud at Customer, they take a while to set up and then once they start getting set up because it's a little bit more complicated. We follow a very, very special security model and what we do is, it's really a land-and-expand model. The customer brings in some workloads and then they realize how incredible it is. And it runs their database workloads, it runs their other workloads so quickly, so cost effectively that it just builds in momentum. The thing that, as I said, it takes a while to actually land and get it all set up, but now it's gotten to be a good size and then it's just accelerating for us. And so that's really where we're at. It is a global product. It is completely differentiated, and it is very profitable for us. And it fits the need of our customers because remember their Oracle workloads in particular really, really run amazingly, but also those are their most important workloads often and those have to be perfect. And that's really \u2013 they have to be secure, they have to be performing, they have to be always up, and they have to be economical for them, and it's just a \u2013 it's a perfect match for what they need.\nMichael Turits: Great. Thanks, Safra.\nKen Bond: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Yes. Thank you very much. So you seem to have pivoted your CapEx approach a bit from just-in-time purchases to carrying a bit of a capacity buffer, so that you can deploy all these OCI wins. I'm just curious Safra, does it take a quarter or two and then, you have enough of a buffer there or do you see such a pipeline for OCI demand that this CapEx rise perhaps could last a while longer, which might be a good news for future revenue growth?\nSafra Catz: Well, I don't like to be cut short. That's for sure. And so I want to make sure I have enough, but we do have enormous demand frankly. So this is what I always call a high-class problem, but we try to make sure that we manage it very, very carefully. I thought it was worth it to take on quite a bit more inventory, but it is getting used up very quickly all the time. And we stay very, very focused on being able to deliver to our customers, the demand, but we have such accelerating demand that we have to stay vigilant to make sure we've got what we need, where we need it and in the quantities that we need it.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nSafra Catz: Thank you. Ken, we can't hear you.\nKen Bond: Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's Oracle first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was $100 million above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance. As the dollar strengthened from when I gave guidance and it strengthened significantly, we didn't get the benefit we would have gotten had it stayed at the same level throughout the quarter. Now from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and accounted for 76% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues are now at an annualized revenue of $10 billion with an accelerating growth rate that we expect will exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 7% with Fusion apps up 26% in USD and 24% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office applications grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 30% and NetSuite ERP, up 26%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 3%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew in the mid-30s, and we saw triple-digit booking growth this quarter. So I expect the infrastructure revenue growth will ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 80% in constant currency and Cloud at Customer revenue was up 44%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and that's up from 4% last quarter. License revenues were $813 million, down 8% after a tough compare from last year's Q1. So all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.7 billion, up 4% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 2%. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 2% from last year, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, slightly below our base tax rate of 19%, and earnings per share was US$1.03, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. As a result of some discrete items, the GAAP tax rate was 8.4%, and GAAP EPS was US$0.86, which was up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $15.3 billion, up 17% in USD, and our free cash flow over the same period was $12.6 billion, up 9% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, also over the same period. CapEx for Q1 alone was $1.1 billion. We now have more than $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10 billion, up 1% from a year-ago due to timing differences in customer payments, but with gross deferred revenue up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO, our balance is $38.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency, due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares for a total of $8 billion. And over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 46% and in average price, that's about half the current share price. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to guidance what you are all waiting for. I remain highly confident that fiscal year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate because our fast-growing cloud businesses are becoming a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue growth for fiscal year 2022, which is the one we're in, somewhere in the mid-single digits in constant currency and accelerating. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect company operating margins will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2. And I will review this on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a very minor positive effect on total revenue and EPS in Q2. Total revenue for Q2 are expected to grow between 3% to 5% in both USD and constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenue for Q2 are expected to grow more than 5% in both USD and constant currency and then climb higher through the second half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in both USD and constant currency and be between $1.09 and $1.13. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary both up and down, but I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our non-GAAP tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Thanks, Larry. Ken, I think we're ready to take questions. Raimo, maybe I'll start and then Larry can add in. I think that one of the things has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data, that capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented, your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud, and also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID. And there is no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked and I think it's our third year in a row in the top right-hand quadrant on Gartner really with no one even close to us, we are the number one choice for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there is just incredible momentum and commitment from our \u2013 from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise either with our products or historically with SAP where they just can't continue like they did. Well, you and your colleagues have been following Oracle for a long time and you know that when we talk about investing, we still focus on increasing profitability, okay. We're not like many of these other companies that when they invest, they lose money or they don't make more money. We will make more money this year, while investing and accelerating than we did before. So that's our expectation is we don't have to pick. We've never believed we have to pick because we have differentiated products that are very high value. You know how we run the company. We don't waste money. We spend it on things that bring returns, and we're very careful about that, but we have so much demand worldwide right now for really our cloud product lines pretty much across the Board, whether it's our Database Services, our Cloud at Customer, our OCI Gen 2, our Fusion products, it's just such a great time that even though we're going to invest more, we will make more. And so we just don't think you have to pick one or the other. It's just a matter of \u2013 this is an important time for us to invest, but we're going to make more money. Yes, I mean, one of the things I didn't mention was that consumption at Cloud at Customer is up over 150%. So you need to understand that once Cloud at Customer, they take a while to set up and then once they start getting set up because it's a little bit more complicated. We follow a very, very special security model and what we do is, it's really a land-and-expand model. The customer brings in some workloads and then they realize how incredible it is.

            "name": "Lawrence Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Oracle Cloud business, infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year. Oracle and NetSuite were pioneers in cloud application. Oracle and NetSuite being the very first cloud company of any kind. Several years later, Amazon launched the very first cloud infrastructure company. Oracle Fusion ERP has over 8,000 cloud customers. NetSuite ERP has over 28,000 cloud applications customers. Oracle is the overwhelming market leader in the global cloud ERP market. Oracle Cloud ERP is currently used by many of the largest, most complex companies on Earth. This past quarter, in Q1, a company I couldn't name until now, major portion of Bank of America went live on Oracle Fusion ERP consolidating ledgers in 33 separate countries into one global cloud ledger. Also in Q1, another huge bank, Macquarie, the largest investment bank in Australia went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Also in Q1, Vanguard, the largest global mutual fund provider went live with Oracle Fusion ERP, not just in Q1. Oracle Fusion is building a very strong position in the world's largest financial services company. HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, they are all live on Oracle's Fusion applications. We have started working with our strategic partners and banking to develop a new generation of cloud B2B financing and payment systems. There are things you can do on the cloud you could never do on-premise. There are opportunities in the cloud. If you are the largest ERP supplier, there are opportunities to go into new businesses like financing and payments with banking partners that would have been impossible with the old on-premise systems, and those are opportunities we are aggressively pursuing with the world's money center banks. Banking and healthcare will be Oracle's two largest verticals going forward. Speaking of healthcare, Humana was an important Fusion ERP win in Q1. In the infrastructure part of our cloud business, we continue to innovate in several technical areas. We have made great progress and we are now on our way into the big four global hyperscalers, and I'll give you a list of those in case you don't know. They are Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Google, note the order. I was not the one who sorted that list. Oracle has come a long way in the cloud infrastructure business. Our technology is getting really good and very competitive. And of course, we continue to deliver breakthrough innovations in areas where we have long been strongest like database. The Oracle Database remains unrivaled and running the world's biggest and most critical systems. And our other database, the open-source system, MySQL, is now on a new generation, and it now includes an ultra-high performance in-memory query processor called HeatWave, plus a new set of management tools called the AutoPilot. Amazon's version of MySQL, again MySQL is an open-source database, anyone can have it. Amazon took the version of MySQL renamed it Aurora and put it up in AWS. Now, the open-source version of MySQL, the old version of MySQL pre-HeatWave is very, very slow with query processing. In fact, the way you use Aurora typically in Amazon over the years is you do your transaction processing in Aurora, also known as MySQL. And then when you do your query processing, you moved your data out of Amazon's MySQL on to Aurora and put into a thing called RedShift, a data warehouse system from Amazon. Recently, SnowFlake has come up with a data warehouse that runs at AWS and SnowFlake competing quite effectively against RedShift because SnowFlake runs on multiple clouds, and SnowFlake like RedShift is way faster at queries than the old MySQL or Aurora. Okay. So Oracle introduces this new version of MySQL, this new generation of MySQL with HeatWave. And the customer reaction has been stupendous simply for the reason that over and over again, they measure Oracle's MySQL to be 100x faster than Amazon's Aurora for query processing. Now, this was actually not unexpected. The old MySQL, which is Aurora, that's what Aurora is, the old MySQL, it's terrible for query processing. What was unexpected is that Oracle MySQL proved to be more than 10x faster than Amazon RedShift or SnowFlake for query processing. So suddenly, there is one database, you can do transaction \u2013 one open-source database, you can do transaction processing on, MySQL with HeatWave. And that same database, MySQL with HeatWave is the fastest place to run your queries. So you don't need to move your data into RedShift or SnowFlake anymore just to do query. This is excited so many customers that they asked us over and over again. We made it available this quarter Oracle's MySQL with HeatWave is available at the Oracle Public Cloud, but they asked if we would make it available on other public clouds. And we thought that's what our customers want, that's what we are going to do. So we plan to make Oracle MySQL with HeatWave available on other public clouds in addition to the Oracle Public Cloud and compete aggressively where we have huge technical advantages over Amazon Aurora, Amazon RedShift and perhaps most interestingly, huge technical advantages, performance and cost over SnowFlake. I'll turn it back to Safra. Yes, I'll add. Your question about services, we have pretty much made the migration away from on-premise implementations where all of our staff is focused on cloud implementations. And during that transition, every time we go through one of these transitions, it looks like something isn't growing or worse yet something is shrinking. Well, in this case, the on-premise stuff went down until it almost went away. And basically all of the implementation services you see for applications are cloud implementations. We've now made the migration and that should just grow steadily as demand for those systems increases. We really don't have a lot of competition. That's the understatement of the year in cloud ERP. I'd love to know who the competitors are. SAP doesn't have a product. When we \u2013 we're in a competition with the SAP right now and we've just gotten \u2013 we just found out, we're vendor of choice and their big thing was SAP doesn't have a cloud product. They have hosting. They're willing to put a custom computer in Amazon and just build a specialized version for the customer. That's not the cloud. We update our applications every three months, the entire fleet of 8,000 Fusion customers are updated every three months. The entire fleet of 28,000 NetSuite customers are updated every six months. You get SAP, they install it and then they probably will update it again five years now. It's an on-premise system. They don't have a cloud system. We're winning every deal against them, everyone, and we're taking a lot of their customers away. Well, I think the big question was, I think, the big issue that remains open about Oracle \u2013 I would say, it probably still remains open about Oracle is can Oracle compete with database against Amazon? It's interesting question because Amazon doesn't really have it. Well, Amazon has like 13 separate databases where the Oracle data, we do everything in a single database. We don't think an application should talk to five or six separate databases. We think it's a very risky security architecture. But the question is Amazon is the big leader in cloud. We're the big leader in databases. Well, if forced to choose, will they pick the Amazon Cloud and a database other than the Oracle Database? And - or are they willing to move to migrate their Oracle applications to the Oracle Cloud to get the Oracle \u2013 all the security and performance advantages of the Oracle Database? That's been the big question out there. And with our cloud good enough to compete with Amazon and Google and Microsoft, and I think we have answered those questions. It's not only good enough to compete. It's - in many cases, it's much better for security, for performance, for reliability, for cost, we're cheaper. And that's one of the reasons we have such a big ISV business. And so many people have left Amazon and come to the Oracle Cloud was because we cost less. So we have significant cost advantages. And I think this is another big step to proving that the Oracle Cloud is part of the big four. It's not a big three. It's a big four. I'm not including the Chinese players because they're regional or not global. I'm counting the Gartner sequence and the Gartner sequence is Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, Google. And if we're in the big four and virtually every important database application on Earth runs \u2013 I mean, not everyone, but the vast majority run on the Oracle Database. If those migrate to the Oracle Cloud, we have a very, very large business, and we're seeing people moving more and more things to the Oracle Cloud. Now in this Gartner report, we will just help \u2013 we'll move that along quite nicely. By the way, it's not just the Gartner report. If they come and look and they run, if they do a comparison, a straighter comparison us, Google, us, Amazon, they test the application in both places. We win all of those. It's when they don't come and look that we have a problem. Yes, I'd like to just second that with an example in the past, recent history where when we bought NetSuite, we considered NetSuite strategic. We thought this is a company that it should be growing even faster than it was independently as a part of Oracle. And so we made a number of investments in NetSuite, and we've seen their growth \u2013 NetSuite has gotten bigger obviously, but their growth rate has increased and we've invested, but we've made more money and we're growing faster in NetSuite. So I think that's the model that Safra likes to implement. And it seems to be working pretty well at NetSuite. We don't see why it would be any different in a larger business like the Oracle Public Cloud. Absolutely. We have corporate customers. They've been with us for a while that are expanding. Maybe the most interesting thing about this is, are the ISVs because the ISVs, I mean they are in the cloud business. I mean, that's their whole business. They run \u2013 their primary expense is running their cloud operations. And when a number of those companies move from Amazon to Oracle, I mean, I'll give you a bunch of examples, then they really take a close look at the economics of what they're doing the reliability of the system. Zoom is a famous example, but there are a bunch of other ISV examples of companies that have moved from Amazon to Oracle. So that is really very encouraging. But we're seeing it now in our corporate customers as well. They move a workload. That works, they wait. They move in two or three more workloads. That's continuing. So we think again, as Gartner report is one more step in the right direction in terms of encouraging our corporate customers to move even more workloads and accelerate the rate. But have we seen a pattern? Yes. We move a workload for a customer, and move a second workload to third workload. Once they understand, it works smoothly and the economics are advantageous. They just move more workloads on a continuous basis and that's what we are experiencing."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be cause actual results to differ from what we are talking about today. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. But before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses. And as a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now, I don't blame you for not believing me at the time. Fiscal year 2020 growth was zero. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly. And that's despite the closure of our nearly half a billion dollar Russia business. Since fiscal year 2020, our strategic back office SaaS business has more than doubled in size. And consumption of our Gen 2 cloud infrastructure service is now seven times larger. And while competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter and with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. And we're far from done. In fact, I just told my team, I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 targets that we shared with you last fall at our financial analyst meeting. And our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside. Our momentum has been driven by two fundamental differences from our competition. One, highly differentiated technology. And two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive, and innovative set of apps across back office, CX, and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it. And it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries. Having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins. On the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment. But the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle infrastructure for all their requirements, be they new services like AI training or services we're known for, like database and Java. To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customers' success. That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand-in-hand with companies as they try out our technology and continues all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success. As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS. This group ensures that customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases, from planning to activation to implementation to support to anything else they need to succeed. We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love, ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates, and referencing. Now, I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates, and also provide a full picture. I'm going to share with you results, including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS, was $4.4 billion, up 55%, with IaaS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77%, and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up more than 33%, at $3.8 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support, were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 11%. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.4 billion, was up 17%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion, and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 24%. Together, our strategic back office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for four straight years. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%, excluding legacy hosting services. Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 89%, with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%. Cloud at customer consumption revenue was up 60%, and autonomous database was up 47%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and cloud at customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration, alongside back office SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14%, following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, were $13.8 billion, up 18%. Shifting to margins, the gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78%, as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue, and now it's down to 53%. But this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support, even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10% excluding Cerner in Q4. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continued to integrate Cerner. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%. And excluding revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions were 35%, and 10%, excluding Cerner, compared to 8% last year. And total infrastructure grew 10%, compared with 5% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21%. Total cloud services by itself were up 50%, to $15.9 billion. And excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29%, to $13.6 billion. And with revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year, and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.12 in USD, up 4% in USD, and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 42%, at $5.6 billion. While free cash flow was up 46%, at $3.7 billion. Now over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year, as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year. And I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal 24 free cash flow. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency, due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO was 15% in constant currency, as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate. I expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud regions. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot. And this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection and I now expect the fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx. I also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world with another 7 being built. 12 of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many, many clouded customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and 9 more planned. And lastly, we have 9 national security regions live with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This year, this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months as the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now to guidance. And as I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis like everything else. If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0 to 1% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.01 positive effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency and 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% to 13% and be between $1.12 and $1.16 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5. However, as you see nearly every quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Now, before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth, we are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023, even though our base is much bigger and may be higher. As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024. And of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well. Okay. Before I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023 such an enormous success. You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. And I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' missions so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades. And I think you all see that our best days are, in fact, ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty and for your incredibly hard work. And thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman, and our founder for leading with brilliance, determination, and vision, and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. So thanks, Larry. And with that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. The hardware and software in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers' clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud-controlled computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enable our Gen2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. And in the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast, and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network that is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large-language models. NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen2 Cloud. And we are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs. The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen2 Cloud has made Oracle the number one choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, Fouhear [Ph], Modal Labs, Character, HyperReal, SliceX, Vector Space Bio, Falconry, Respeacher, Altair, InfoWorld, 12 Labs, Layton Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud. One last thing. In partnership with Cohere Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models. Oracle's application development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in two new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals and one for first responders. Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data. Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner, Cohere, is also using the Oracle Gen2 Cloud for training their own large language models. In health care alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new life-saving drugs, improve the quality of patient care, and increase access to health care by lowering costs. A technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra.\nSafra Catz: I think we're going to take some questions. Ken?\nKen Bond: Yes, thank you, Safra. Thank you, Larry. Lisa, if we could please prepare the audience for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. My question's for, I think, mainly for Safra, but maybe Larry has some thoughts, too. It's somewhat surprising to see the acceleration across all your cloud businesses when others, whether it's the other hyperscalers or even other cloud-based vendors, are seeing just the opposite effects in this environment today, in today's environment. And that's important. We get the better performance at a lower price. That makes a lot of sense, at least in, I've been around quite a while, I guess. And usually, in tough environments, we see people just freeze. But that's not what's happening here. So the question, in addition to what I just said, better performance at lower price, why? Is there anything else, outside of like Oracle, even, that would show your cloud business accelerating when other pretty good companies are doing just the opposite?\nSafra Catz: Let me take a start at it. And Larry, you add in here. First of all, the fact that OCI is just growing and accelerating is because customers want to spend less. And they also need to do more. They need to stay competitive. They need to stay agile. And so our technology, whether it's our applications, which allow them to spend a lot less and make better decisions running their business, so that's very, very natural. So our Fusion, and there's just so many things about Fusion that are so compelling. It costs less, it just helps them run their business. But then you go to OCI, where some of these customers are coming from our competitors. And as Larry said, imagine, Larry talked about the workload being twice as fast on OCI. But imagine it's 10 times as fast, or 100 times faster, or as is common in some cases, 1,000 times faster. So imagine what that bill looks like. So we have compelling technology at a much lower price. And that's without a doubt causing our customers to move to us more quickly. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add into that.\nLarry Ellison: Well, I'm just going to be a little more specific, because Safra says, I said, if we run twice as fast, we cost twice as much. No, we cost half as much, half as much. We run twice as fast, we cost half as much. But sometimes we do run a lot more than twice as fast. And we cost a lot less than half as much. We announced a new database, a new version of MySQL with a fast query processor called HeatWave. And we have customers moving from Amazon Aurora, where they're experiencing 1,000 times speedup, versus Aurora, we're 1,000 times faster in query processing than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's an open source database that we added a fast query processor to. We're much, much cheaper. And that's one example. In a lot of cases, it's much more than two to one. We can build GPUs that other people can't build because we have a fast network. We use this very fast RDMA network, and we started with that. In our Gen2 cloud, we had nothing but our entire network was a super-fast network, which means most of the applications, most of the things you run in the Oracle cloud are going to be much faster than our competitors' clouds because they don't use that kind of network. So we have huge cost advantages, huge cost advantages across a broad portfolio of applications. Let me throw in one thing. It cost one-tenth, one-tenth to implement Fusion ERP versus SAP's new ERP system with HANA. So the cost of implementing our applications are dramatically lower than our competitors. So we have a lot of people moving from AWS to our cloud for infrastructure services, a lot of people continuing to move from SAP to Fusion. We're seeing that migration, and we're taking a lot of market share from our competitors. That's why we're doing better, and they're not doing quite as well.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. Well, thank you, and really nice job. Thanks.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Larry, Oracle is somewhat unique in being a leader in both infrastructure and applications. And when we look back, I don't know, maybe five years from now, how much of the generative AI opportunity will have been captured on the infrastructure side of your business versus within apps? And I'm not just thinking strategic back office apps. I'm thinking front office, Cerner, and all the other verticals as well.\nLarry Ellison: Yes, absolutely. It's very hard to answer that question. A long time ago, I said the biggest difference between - the biggest strategic difference between Oracle's cloud and everyone else's cloud is actually not the RDMA network. That's a technical difference. The biggest strategic difference is that we do both that we use our infrastructure and build applications with it. So we learn a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure by building lots of applications, enterprise-scale applications, on top of our infrastructure. So we have this continuous feedback loop. We're building applications, obtaining insights, making improvements in our productivity. We have a new programming language. We have Java, and we love Java. We use it a lot for building applications. But we have this other low-code application development tool called APEX. And we're now building a lot of our applications in APEX. And our productivity gains are, again, a factor of 10. And we build the applications in one tenth the time, or one tenth the amount of people, or at one tenth the cost. But these are not typical low-code applications. These are applications that can scale to millions of users and all over the world. So most low-code applications are for small projects. We use them for applications we've rolled out globally. And we've made our underlying infrastructure, the APEX development environment, the underlying APEX database, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database, has made our application developers dramatically more productive. It's one of the reasons why we bought into the idea that we could rewrite a whole suite of medical applications in a very, very short period of time, that we could redo Cerner very, very quickly because of these underlying tools. Let me close with one last thing. Again, we use AI technology to make our database better. And it's an autonomous database. You don't need DBAs. It recovers itself. It updates itself. It adds more space. It really is a self-driving database. We've used AI technology to do that. We've used AI technology throughout our cloud, where our cloud is self-healing. We repair bugs while the cloud is running. We have an autonomous Linux operating system that's different than all of the other Linuxes. You can patch it online. It patches itself online. It repairs itself online. So again, by being in those two businesses, applications and underlying infrastructure, we again, use our infrastructure and make it better to make our applications better and we gain insights as what we need to do with our, what we need to add to our infrastructure to make the applications better. So, infrastructures make the applications better, applications make the infrastructure better. We're the only company with that continuous feedback loop and I think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in technology. It's why we have technologies that other people don't have.\nBrad Zelnick: Very helpful, color. Thank you, Larry.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I want to dig into the application part of the business. Very impressive SaaS growth, especially in Fusion Apps and Cloud ERP in this macro environment. So, what are you hearing from your customer in terms of migrating to the SaaS application and what's driving that? And also, the CloudWorld last year, you talked about the opportunity in combining horizontal application with vertical offering. So, how is that helping SaaS growth?\nSafra Catz: Okay. Well, I will tell you that there's no question. Our secret weapon is the fact that we have vertical applications also. Many of our customers end up wanting to buy a vertical application and Fusion together and it's industry by industry. We will be posting online probably some of our wins for the quarter, but what you'll see is when we have existing customers in a segment and a vertical application in that, we truly are, without a doubt, the most popular. Whether it's healthcare with all of our existing customers, whether they be Cerner customers, the fact that we have ERP and HCM, SCM, all of our horizontal applications, CX, as well as the vertical applications, it makes us very tough to beat. New healthcare wins are going to be listed many, many, many go-lives, the same in financial services, retail, hospitality, these whole segments end up wanting to buy their entire solution from us. And that really makes us also very sensitive to their needs and we can fill them much better. So, that's been a big winner for us. And I will tell you that our customers also, when they move from on-premise, they realize that they're moving into the 21st century with a much better system, but also a much lower cost system that also is kept current every 90 days. New capabilities become available. They'll never have to do that big implementation every five years like some of the older companies who say they're cloud, but aren't actually cloud. They're just hosted. So, our products are just so differentiated all around that we're just building momentum around the world. Go ahead.\nLarry Ellison: Let me just add one example to Safra's comments, which I think are right on. But there's an interesting example. Everyone knows we compete with Workday in HCM or HR, whatever. When we bought Cerner, we decided that we were going to take our HCM system, our HR system, and specialize it, add features specifically for the healthcare industry. Now, it turns out managing a workforce in a hospital is very complex because the nurses might have private patients at home that they're seeing. They might work for two or three different hospitals. They might do some work in clinics as well. So, scheduling these people who have multiple jobs, doctors may have teaching assignments in universities. Obviously, they travel and they also have their own office hours. They may have a private practice in addition to working at the hospital. Scheduling these professionals is very, very tricky. Recruiting the professionals is very, very tricky. Paying them when you're working three days a week, one week, two days the next week, six days the following week, paying them can be very complex. So we have had a major effort in our HCM system, the Oracle Fusion HCM system, and adding all the features that hospitals need to manage their professional staff. Now, there's no way, there's no way we would have done that unless we had a focus in the healthcare industry. So we not only have all the Cerner healthcare apps for hospitals, we've specialized our ERP system for hospitals, we've specialized our HCM for managing the hospital workforce. We've done a bunch of things around the healthcare industry. One of the things we want to do is, we're the largest provider of clinical trial software. But the clinical, the results of the clinical trial goes to a government regulator. And we're now working with the government regulators to develop the software that allows them to take the clinical trial output in digital form and get it through the regulatory process much faster at a much lower cost. So we're looking at the entire healthcare ecosystem and trying to automate both sides of the transaction. The pharmaceutical company that's designing the drug, the hospitals that are testing the drug, and the regulators that are approving the drug should all be digitized. And we are well on our way to doing that because of our investment in Cerner. And now what has blossomed into an investment across the entire healthcare ecosystem.\nSiti Panigrahi: That's a perfect example, Larry. Thank you both for the color.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you. Could I switch gear a little bit? A question for Safra. Safra, we now have Cerner in as part of Oracle. Where are we on the cost, on the synergy capture and cost takeout? And so are we, do you see we are done there or are we kind of still at the beginning of a journey? Thank you. And congrats for me as well.\nSafra Catz: Thank you. I actually feel like we're still at the beginning if you want to know the truth. We wanted to stabilize the operation. We definitely didn't want to risk breaking anything. You will be seeing some more significant changes and we have legal entity combination imminently and that actually gives us a lot more flexibility regarding the way we operate the business. We are just at the very beginning of it. Their margins are nowhere close to the way we run our company and we are right at the, I'd say we're at the beginning-ish, sort of at the beginning of the middle at most. We've got a long way to go on just operationally and we've got a lot of work going on on the development side as we bring our technical capabilities into the product and move them into the Oracle Cloud. There are a lot of savings as we do that also.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter and frankly on the guidance. I'd like to get a better understanding about the underpinning of the OCI Gen 2 business. Specifically, can you give us some color on the customer concentration, industry concentration, both in the existing customer base as well as the pipeline and how you think that's going to change over time? Thanks.\nSafra Catz: I don't know, Larry, if you want to take a stab at it. The reality is that our customers run from very small to very large. As a general matter, we're a small percentage of their IT costs when they get started and sometimes a small percentage of their cloud spending. As they try us out, they move larger percentages of their business off of other clouds or from on-premise. We're at the very beginning of this movement, especially on the database side as more and more of our customers, our big customers often have cloud a customer or dedicated regions is sort of their ultimate goal for their most critical database workloads. We're at the absolute beginning of that with most of our customers. It's basically what we find is if you give us a chance, it is so much better, so much more cost effective, of course, so much more secure that customers very quickly realize how advantageous it is to move. It's all industries. As some of you know, auto companies are doing their simulations with us. It's really across industries, across sizes. It's very, very diversified. Larry, I don't know if you have additional comments.\nLarry Ellison: Yes, maybe the most interesting industry that's adopting the Oracle Cloud are people who are in the technology business. So a lot of our customers are, I mean, their business, I mean, Zoom, in the early days of Oracle, it wasn't long ago we were talking about Zoom and still very excited about Zoom. And they came to us, one of our earliest, very, very large customers. And a lot of their business is just running an app, if you will, an application on the cloud. And a huge amount of their expense is running that application in the cloud and doing it efficiently. And where we're most obvious, I mean, NVIDIA is an extraordinary company, but Cohere is a great company. But a lot of their expense is running AI training in the cloud. And when it's that much of your expense, if we're a lot faster, they do a lot of due diligence about the technology. And it became very apparent, a lot of the early adopters, if you will, and we're still in the early stages, a lot of the early adopters at scale of the Oracle Cloud were highly technical companies like a Zoom or an NVIDIA, I can name a bunch of others, or a highly technical industry like phone companies, telecommunication companies, where they see the advantages, not only, by the way, the performance and cost advantages. Another thing that we're very proud of is because of our network, we're highly reliable. And because of the autonomy, we're highly reliable. If, for example, the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't lose your data, because you can't make a pilot. Usually a lot of the data loss is caused by pilot error. Well, with the Oracle Autonomous Database, the driver is the system. It's a self-driving database. So you can't make a human error that causes you to lose data. So it's very, where a phone company has to be up 24 hours a day, where a bank really is not supposed to lose your data, where a huge percentage of your expenses are your own cloud expenses, and your technology company delivering technology services from somebody else's cloud. In those areas is where we've seen adoption of Oracle at scale. And the less technical companies are now beginning their journey of looking more closely at the Oracle cloud. And when they do look closely, we compare very favorably with the other clouds.\nMark Moerdler: That's very helpful. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll take the last question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Hi, thanks very much. Just a quick one for Safra, if I could. Safra, obviously, a very strong free cash flow quarter. We've gotten some questions from investors wondering about the CapEx this quarter, where you saw some efficiencies, how you're able to keep CapEx flat going into next year, given the fact that you're going to seeing this great demand for OCI. So could you double click on that a little bit for us? Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Yes. I mean, this past year was a big CapEx number as compared to usual. And we put out a lot of capacity. It is getting filled up, and getting used up. And I think we're getting real economies. In addition, one of the things you don't realize is that our underlying infrastructure, for example, I'll give you one example, our underlying infrastructure becomes more and more efficient, even under the best example actually is under Fusion. As we move, as we've moved to OCI, we are also moving to Autonomous Database Serverless, which again gives us added capacity. So we're constantly, constantly becoming more efficient. Our original landing was 12 racks. We're moving to 10 racks to have all the services. We're just continuing to sort of miniaturize our capabilities and it's giving us enormous efficiencies and cost savings. So staying the same as this year, again, if it just becomes overwhelming, it may go up higher, but I think we've got it very much in hand. We've laid out a lot this past year and I think if we stay where we're at, we're going to be able to fit a lot more workloads within that envelope, straightforwardly.\nKirk Materne: Great, thanks and congrats on the order.\nSafra Catz: Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Safra. Thank you, Kirk. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today and with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. But before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses. And as a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now, I don't blame you for not believing me at the time. Fiscal year 2020 growth was zero. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly. And that's despite the closure of our nearly half a billion dollar Russia business. Since fiscal year 2020, our strategic back office SaaS business has more than doubled in size. And consumption of our Gen 2 cloud infrastructure service is now seven times larger. And while competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter and with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. And we're far from done. In fact, I just told my team, I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 targets that we shared with you last fall at our financial analyst meeting. And our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside. Our momentum has been driven by two fundamental differences from our competition. One, highly differentiated technology. And two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive, and innovative set of apps across back office, CX, and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it. And it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries. Having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins. On the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment. But the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle infrastructure for all their requirements, be they new services like AI training or services we're known for, like database and Java. To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customers' success. That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand-in-hand with companies as they try out our technology and continues all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success. As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS. This group ensures that customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases, from planning to activation to implementation to support to anything else they need to succeed. We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love, ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates, and referencing. Now, I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates, and also provide a full picture. I'm going to share with you results, including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS, was $4.4 billion, up 55%, with IaaS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77%, and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up more than 33%, at $3.8 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support, were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 11%. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.4 billion, was up 17%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion, and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 24%. Together, our strategic back office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for four straight years. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%, excluding legacy hosting services. Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 89%, with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%. Cloud at customer consumption revenue was up 60%, and autonomous database was up 47%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and cloud at customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration, alongside back office SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14%, following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, were $13.8 billion, up 18%. Shifting to margins, the gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78%, as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue, and now it's down to 53%. But this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support, even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10% excluding Cerner in Q4. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continued to integrate Cerner. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%. And excluding revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions were 35%, and 10%, excluding Cerner, compared to 8% last year. And total infrastructure grew 10%, compared with 5% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21%. Total cloud services by itself were up 50%, to $15.9 billion. And excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29%, to $13.6 billion. And with revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year, and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.12 in USD, up 4% in USD, and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 42%, at $5.6 billion. While free cash flow was up 46%, at $3.7 billion. Now over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year, as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year. And I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal 24 free cash flow. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency, due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO was 15% in constant currency, as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate. I expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud regions. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot. And this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection and I now expect the fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx. I also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world with another 7 being built. 12 of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many, many clouded customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and 9 more planned. And lastly, we have 9 national security regions live with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This year, this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months as the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now to guidance. And as I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis like everything else. If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0 to 1% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.01 positive effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency and 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% to 13% and be between $1.12 and $1.16 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5. However, as you see nearly every quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Now, before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth, we are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023, even though our base is much bigger and may be higher. As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024. And of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well. Okay. Before I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023 such an enormous success. You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. And I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' missions so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades. And I think you all see that our best days are, in fact, ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty and for your incredibly hard work. And thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman, and our founder for leading with brilliance, determination, and vision, and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. So thanks, Larry. And with that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments. I think we're going to take some questions. Ken? Let me take a start at it. And Larry, you add in here. First of all, the fact that OCI is just growing and accelerating is because customers want to spend less. And they also need to do more. They need to stay competitive. They need to stay agile. And so our technology, whether it's our applications, which allow them to spend a lot less and make better decisions running their business, so that's very, very natural. So our Fusion, and there's just so many things about Fusion that are so compelling. It costs less, it just helps them run their business. But then you go to OCI, where some of these customers are coming from our competitors. And as Larry said, imagine, Larry talked about the workload being twice as fast on OCI. But imagine it's 10 times as fast, or 100 times faster, or as is common in some cases, 1,000 times faster. So imagine what that bill looks like. So we have compelling technology at a much lower price. And that's without a doubt causing our customers to move to us more quickly. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add into that. Okay. Well, I will tell you that there's no question. Our secret weapon is the fact that we have vertical applications also. Many of our customers end up wanting to buy a vertical application and Fusion together and it's industry by industry. We will be posting online probably some of our wins for the quarter, but what you'll see is when we have existing customers in a segment and a vertical application in that, we truly are, without a doubt, the most popular. Whether it's healthcare with all of our existing customers, whether they be Cerner customers, the fact that we have ERP and HCM, SCM, all of our horizontal applications, CX, as well as the vertical applications, it makes us very tough to beat. New healthcare wins are going to be listed many, many, many go-lives, the same in financial services, retail, hospitality, these whole segments end up wanting to buy their entire solution from us. And that really makes us also very sensitive to their needs and we can fill them much better. So, that's been a big winner for us. And I will tell you that our customers also, when they move from on-premise, they realize that they're moving into the 21st century with a much better system, but also a much lower cost system that also is kept current every 90 days. New capabilities become available. They'll never have to do that big implementation every five years like some of the older companies who say they're cloud, but aren't actually cloud. They're just hosted. So, our products are just so differentiated all around that we're just building momentum around the world. Go ahead. Thank you. I actually feel like we're still at the beginning if you want to know the truth. We wanted to stabilize the operation. We definitely didn't want to risk breaking anything. You will be seeing some more significant changes and we have legal entity combination imminently and that actually gives us a lot more flexibility regarding the way we operate the business. We are just at the very beginning of it. Their margins are nowhere close to the way we run our company and we are right at the, I'd say we're at the beginning-ish, sort of at the beginning of the middle at most. We've got a long way to go on just operationally and we've got a lot of work going on on the development side as we bring our technical capabilities into the product and move them into the Oracle Cloud. There are a lot of savings as we do that also. Thank you. I don't know, Larry, if you want to take a stab at it. The reality is that our customers run from very small to very large. As a general matter, we're a small percentage of their IT costs when they get started and sometimes a small percentage of their cloud spending. As they try us out, they move larger percentages of their business off of other clouds or from on-premise. We're at the very beginning of this movement, especially on the database side as more and more of our customers, our big customers often have cloud a customer or dedicated regions is sort of their ultimate goal for their most critical database workloads. We're at the absolute beginning of that with most of our customers. It's basically what we find is if you give us a chance, it is so much better, so much more cost effective, of course, so much more secure that customers very quickly realize how advantageous it is to move. It's all industries. As some of you know, auto companies are doing their simulations with us. It's really across industries, across sizes. It's very, very diversified. Larry, I don't know if you have additional comments. Yes. I mean, this past year was a big CapEx number as compared to usual. And we put out a lot of capacity. It is getting filled up, and getting used up. And I think we're getting real economies. In addition, one of the things you don't realize is that our underlying infrastructure, for example, I'll give you one example, our underlying infrastructure becomes more and more efficient, even under the best example actually is under Fusion. As we move, as we've moved to OCI, we are also moving to Autonomous Database Serverless, which again gives us added capacity. So we're constantly, constantly becoming more efficient. Our original landing was 12 racks. We're moving to 10 racks to have all the services. We're just continuing to sort of miniaturize our capabilities and it's giving us enormous efficiencies and cost savings. So staying the same as this year, again, if it just becomes overwhelming, it may go up higher, but I think we've got it very much in hand. We've laid out a lot this past year and I think if we stay where we're at, we're going to be able to fit a lot more workloads within that envelope, straightforwardly. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Safra. The hardware and software in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers' clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud-controlled computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enable our Gen2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. And in the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast, and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network that is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large-language models. NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen2 Cloud. And we are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs. The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen2 Cloud has made Oracle the number one choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, Fouhear [Ph], Modal Labs, Character, HyperReal, SliceX, Vector Space Bio, Falconry, Respeacher, Altair, InfoWorld, 12 Labs, Layton Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud. One last thing. In partnership with Cohere Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models. Oracle's application development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in two new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals and one for first responders. Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data. Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner, Cohere, is also using the Oracle Gen2 Cloud for training their own large language models. In health care alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new life-saving drugs, improve the quality of patient care, and increase access to health care by lowering costs. A technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra. Well, I'm just going to be a little more specific, because Safra says, I said, if we run twice as fast, we cost twice as much. No, we cost half as much, half as much. We run twice as fast, we cost half as much. But sometimes we do run a lot more than twice as fast. And we cost a lot less than half as much. We announced a new database, a new version of MySQL with a fast query processor called HeatWave. And we have customers moving from Amazon Aurora, where they're experiencing 1,000 times speedup, versus Aurora, we're 1,000 times faster in query processing than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's an open source database that we added a fast query processor to. We're much, much cheaper. And that's one example. In a lot of cases, it's much more than two to one. We can build GPUs that other people can't build because we have a fast network. We use this very fast RDMA network, and we started with that. In our Gen2 cloud, we had nothing but our entire network was a super-fast network, which means most of the applications, most of the things you run in the Oracle cloud are going to be much faster than our competitors' clouds because they don't use that kind of network. So we have huge cost advantages, huge cost advantages across a broad portfolio of applications. Let me throw in one thing. It cost one-tenth, one-tenth to implement Fusion ERP versus SAP's new ERP system with HANA. So the cost of implementing our applications are dramatically lower than our competitors. So we have a lot of people moving from AWS to our cloud for infrastructure services, a lot of people continuing to move from SAP to Fusion. We're seeing that migration, and we're taking a lot of market share from our competitors. That's why we're doing better, and they're not doing quite as well. Thank you. Yes, absolutely. It's very hard to answer that question. A long time ago, I said the biggest difference between - the biggest strategic difference between Oracle's cloud and everyone else's cloud is actually not the RDMA network. That's a technical difference. The biggest strategic difference is that we do both that we use our infrastructure and build applications with it. So we learn a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure by building lots of applications, enterprise-scale applications, on top of our infrastructure. So we have this continuous feedback loop. We're building applications, obtaining insights, making improvements in our productivity. We have a new programming language. We have Java, and we love Java. We use it a lot for building applications. But we have this other low-code application development tool called APEX. And we're now building a lot of our applications in APEX. And our productivity gains are, again, a factor of 10. And we build the applications in one tenth the time, or one tenth the amount of people, or at one tenth the cost. But these are not typical low-code applications. These are applications that can scale to millions of users and all over the world. So most low-code applications are for small projects. We use them for applications we've rolled out globally. And we've made our underlying infrastructure, the APEX development environment, the underlying APEX database, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database, has made our application developers dramatically more productive. It's one of the reasons why we bought into the idea that we could rewrite a whole suite of medical applications in a very, very short period of time, that we could redo Cerner very, very quickly because of these underlying tools. Let me close with one last thing. Again, we use AI technology to make our database better. And it's an autonomous database. You don't need DBAs. It recovers itself. It updates itself. It adds more space. It really is a self-driving database. We've used AI technology to do that. We've used AI technology throughout our cloud, where our cloud is self-healing. We repair bugs while the cloud is running. We have an autonomous Linux operating system that's different than all of the other Linuxes. You can patch it online. It patches itself online. It repairs itself online. So again, by being in those two businesses, applications and underlying infrastructure, we again, use our infrastructure and make it better to make our applications better and we gain insights as what we need to do with our, what we need to add to our infrastructure to make the applications better. So, infrastructures make the applications better, applications make the infrastructure better. We're the only company with that continuous feedback loop and I think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in technology. It's why we have technologies that other people don't have. Let me just add one example to Safra's comments, which I think are right on. But there's an interesting example. Everyone knows we compete with Workday in HCM or HR, whatever. When we bought Cerner, we decided that we were going to take our HCM system, our HR system, and specialize it, add features specifically for the healthcare industry. Now, it turns out managing a workforce in a hospital is very complex because the nurses might have private patients at home that they're seeing. They might work for two or three different hospitals. They might do some work in clinics as well. So, scheduling these people who have multiple jobs, doctors may have teaching assignments in universities. Obviously, they travel and they also have their own office hours. They may have a private practice in addition to working at the hospital. Scheduling these professionals is very, very tricky. Recruiting the professionals is very, very tricky. Paying them when you're working three days a week, one week, two days the next week, six days the following week, paying them can be very complex. So we have had a major effort in our HCM system, the Oracle Fusion HCM system, and adding all the features that hospitals need to manage their professional staff. Now, there's no way, there's no way we would have done that unless we had a focus in the healthcare industry. So we not only have all the Cerner healthcare apps for hospitals, we've specialized our ERP system for hospitals, we've specialized our HCM for managing the hospital workforce. We've done a bunch of things around the healthcare industry. One of the things we want to do is, we're the largest provider of clinical trial software. But the clinical, the results of the clinical trial goes to a government regulator. And we're now working with the government regulators to develop the software that allows them to take the clinical trial output in digital form and get it through the regulatory process much faster at a much lower cost. So we're looking at the entire healthcare ecosystem and trying to automate both sides of the transaction. The pharmaceutical company that's designing the drug, the hospitals that are testing the drug, and the regulators that are approving the drug should all be digitized. And we are well on our way to doing that because of our investment in Cerner. And now what has blossomed into an investment across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Yes, maybe the most interesting industry that's adopting the Oracle Cloud are people who are in the technology business. So a lot of our customers are, I mean, their business, I mean, Zoom, in the early days of Oracle, it wasn't long ago we were talking about Zoom and still very excited about Zoom. And they came to us, one of our earliest, very, very large customers. And a lot of their business is just running an app, if you will, an application on the cloud. And a huge amount of their expense is running that application in the cloud and doing it efficiently. And where we're most obvious, I mean, NVIDIA is an extraordinary company, but Cohere is a great company. But a lot of their expense is running AI training in the cloud. And when it's that much of your expense, if we're a lot faster, they do a lot of due diligence about the technology. And it became very apparent, a lot of the early adopters, if you will, and we're still in the early stages, a lot of the early adopters at scale of the Oracle Cloud were highly technical companies like a Zoom or an NVIDIA, I can name a bunch of others, or a highly technical industry like phone companies, telecommunication companies, where they see the advantages, not only, by the way, the performance and cost advantages. Another thing that we're very proud of is because of our network, we're highly reliable. And because of the autonomy, we're highly reliable. If, for example, the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't lose your data, because you can't make a pilot. Usually a lot of the data loss is caused by pilot error. Well, with the Oracle Autonomous Database, the driver is the system. It's a self-driving database. So you can't make a human error that causes you to lose data. So it's very, where a phone company has to be up 24 hours a day, where a bank really is not supposed to lose your data, where a huge percentage of your expenses are your own cloud expenses, and your technology company delivering technology services from somebody else's cloud. In those areas is where we've seen adoption of Oracle at scale. And the less technical companies are now beginning their journey of looking more closely at the Oracle cloud. And when they do look closely, we compare very favorably with the other clouds."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]  Ken Bond, Senior VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks.  And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 represented another great quarter with continued momentum on the top and bottom line. But before I get to the numbers, I want to share with you a few thoughts that explain what's behind our continued financial success. First, our cloud offerings drive operational efficiency. In fact, one of our competitors recently coined the term, the Oracle playbook, which I absolutely love, because the Oracle playbook is all about doing more while spending less. As you all know, we started this ourselves over 20 years ago and have kept it up over all these years, resulting in the highest margins in the software business for decades. Using our own products and services enables us to increase our investments for growth, while also growing profitability, including through acquisitions as well as during our move to the cloud. We are constantly talking with our customers about leveraging Oracle technology to accelerate their speed to market and reduce cost, all the while improving the experience they deliver to their customers. The combination of Oracle's infrastructure and apps, which is unique in the cloud market, increases the intensity of business transformation. Cloud is no longer about just renting commodity white boxes. It's about velocity and value. We have become the enterprise technology vendor of choice because we have products and services that help our customers drive cost efficiencies and modernize their businesses. Second, while AI has been dominating the recent news cycle, the truth is that our Fusion and Infrastructure customers have been using AI as an integral part of their business for some time. Oracle Fusion, with embedded AI, enables customers to close their books in days, not weeks. Oracle AI provides more relevant sales leads. Oracle AI increases infrastructure performance and security with no human intervention. And customers using OCI get AI as a service to help drive their own business transformation. Given our scale and our information advantage across industries and technologies, we are constantly training our applications to do more for our customers, whether it's further what our customers get when they use our platform. And on our Gen 2 OCI platform, the architecture and unique network capability has fast become the platform of choice for many AI companies because OCI runs workloads faster. And time is money in the cloud. So coming to us saves our customers money. Third, customers are putting Oracle's comprehensive and powerful ways to accelerate their businesses. The Uber win was notable because we have yet another example of an industry-transforming company concluding that Oracle's cloud, performance and security exceeds that of our competitors and at a price point that represents a sustainable long-term partnership. Uber will use more of our technology to drive value in their own business. And you're going to see a rising list of these types of strategic wins pile up in the quarters to come. Finally, before I move to the numbers, and hopefully, no one missed this fact, that we're announcing our earnings nine days after the close of the quarter, and we expect to file the Q right away. We continue to set the standard in operating efficiency which helps customers see what's possible when they are working with us.  Okay. Now to the Q3 results. As always, I'll discuss them using constant currency growth rate to provide a full picture both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some revenue results excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, including Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 48% in constant currency, with IaaS revenue of $1.2 billion, up 57% and SaaS revenue of $2.9 billion, up 44%. Now excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 28% in constant currency at $3.5 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.9 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.2 billion and up 33% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, also including support, were $4.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.3 billion and was up 16%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.2 billion and grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up against 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 26% this quarter. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 57% in constant currency. And when you exclude our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 65%, with an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 86%, cloud customer consumption revenue, up 73%, and autonomous database, up 50%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 3% in constant currency, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 40%. Database's subscription revenue is largely made up of on-premise database support. But as these databases migrate from on-premise to the cloud and cloud customer, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside back-office SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenue, including Cerner, were $1.3 billion, up 4% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 21% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing organic revenue growth to be negatively affected by 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 63% of cloud services and license support revenue. Now because our cloud services are growing so fast, it's down to 55%. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6% excluding Cerner. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.2 billion, up 11% from last year. The operating margin, including Cerner, was 42% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. For example, while we have only owned Cerner for three quarters, we have already improved its operating margin by over 5 percentage points compared to before the acquisition. And by the way, I actually expect this year, FY 2023, the one we are closing out in one more quarter, will be the trough year for operating margins and percentages as our margin improvement initiatives play out. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.4% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.22 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, up 13% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars. At quarter end, we had nearly $8.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.6 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.5 billion, and free cash flow was $7.3 billion with capital expenditures of $8.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 11% at $4.3 billion. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $62.3 billion, up 66% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner, which Larry will discuss in a moment. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate was 26% in constant currency. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx this quarter was $2.6 billion as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand you see reflected in the RPO as well as what we see in our pipeline, I expect that our CapEx investments will be about where it is right now for the foreseeable future. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. We now have 41 public cloud regions around the world with another 8 being built. In addition, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many cloud customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions and another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more.  As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% from $0.32 to $0.40 per share. Our financial strategy remains focused on growing non-GAAP operating and pre-tax income while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given increasing customer interest in our cloud technologies, we will continue to prudently invest to meet this demand. As a reminder, because now we're going to talk about Q4, last Q4, we had a spectacular double-digit revenue growth rate, highlighted by 25% constant currency growth in software license. With our continued migration to the cloud, we expect that we will continue to win big deals that are more subscription driven than license driven. These big subscription wins add to the backlog and are recognized over time rather than upfront. That is exactly what we want to see as our cloud business continues to see excellent growth. So now let me turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency would have a 2% negative effect on total revenue and at least 3% plus negative effect on EPS in Q4. But as I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be very different by quarter end. Okay. Here we go. Total revenues for Q4, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in constant currency, and thus are expected to grow 15 to 17 in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% in constant currency, 49 to 51 in USD. I expect total cloud growth for Q4, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. I expect growth in operating profit to be double digits. As you all know, my non-GAAP tax rate guidance is typically 20.5. However, our tax rates over the last two years and Q4 have averaged around 11%, and I anticipate that in Q4, the most likely outcome is a non-GAAP tax rate of around 14.5%. And we've used this rate in determining our EPS guidance for Q4. Now mind you, that's comparing it to 11 or 10.5, I think, last year. Regardless, like past quarters, the actual tax rate for Q4 could be higher or lower and affect our actual EPS. With that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% and 5% and between $1.59 and $1.63 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% and 3% and be between $1.56 and $1.60 in USD.  What have I got here? Anyway, as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q4. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Since June of last year, when we acquired Cerner, that business has increased its health care contract base by approximately $5 billion. We have signed a diverse set of new and expanding domestic and international customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, hospital groups in a dozen U.S. states, multiple hospitals in the United Kingdom, multiple provinces in Canada, the Australian Defence Forces, multiple hospitals in Puerto Rico and multiple countries in the Middle East. While we are pleased with this early success of the Cerner business, we expect the signing of new health care contracts to accelerate over the next few quarters. Well, the Cerner business has been booking billions of dollars in Millennium Clinical and electronic health record systems for hundreds of hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The overall Oracle Healthcare application portfolio is actually much broader, covering virtually the entire health care ecosystem. Hospitals are also buying the Oracle Fusion ERP system to manage their revenue cycle and from reimbursements -- from insurance companies to patient billing, plus their medical supply chain from ordering to inventory. Hospitals are buying Fusion HCM to manage their complex high-value workforce of doctors, nurses and technicians. Pharmaceutical companies are buying Oracle Clinical One to manage clinical trials. Government health organizations, public health organizations are using aggregated EHR data to monitor infectious disease and respond to outbreaks quickly and efficiently. Now I'd like to take a couple of minutes and go over a little more specifically some of the Cerner wins since we bought the company. One was a huge win at Labcorp and Ascension Health to deploy a single lab information system domain for 96 separate hospital-based labs across 10 states. Another one in Puerto Rico, Auxilio Mutuo, is an all-new electronic health record footprint to deploy in a 600-plus bed academic private hospital, replacing Altera, Paragon with Cerner Millennium. Vandalia Health, formerly Charleston Area Medical Center, consolidated all their EMRs into a single unified domain and added four new hospitals. UHS modernized their revenue cycle, migrated to CareAware with the CareAware Cloud and -- for their hospitals and ambulatory clinics. Banner Health implemented a complete revenue cycle management for their health business. The VA deployed our unified electronic health record system to 19 additional sites. The Department of Defense deployed Oracle Cerner EHR to all the OCONUS locations in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense. In the UK, at the National Health Service, Sheffield Teaching Hospital deployed the full suite of Cerner applications across three additional sites and the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The Princess Alexandra Hospital, also in the NHS, is a 430-bed hospital that added the full Cerner suite. Mubadala Health was the first Cerner Millennium client to move from the Cerner data center directly now to the OCI Cloud. As we move our Cerner patients from the Cerner data centers into the Oracle OCI Cloud, we expect to get much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower our costs of providing that cloud service. OCI is just much more efficient than the Cerner data centers that we acquired. We've deployed the full EHR footprint, Cerner footprint to four Sheikh Khalifa Hospitals in the U.A.E. with a capacity of 1,200 beds, serving a population of 1.4 million citizens, again, in the U.A.E. The Australian Department of Defense, we delivered acute care capabilities and deployed an environment for all of the Australian Defence hospitals and field hospitals. In Canada, starting in Nova Scotia, we deployed a one-patient, one-record EHR system across the province for the citizens of Nova Scotia. One-patient, one-record, as you know, I've discussed a long time the fact that patient electronic health records are scattered across every provider they visit. That problem is now being solved in Nova Scotia by having a single unified patient record for every patient regardless of which provider they visit. Their records are still all in one place. Same thing in Niagara Health, a new HR footprint to support delivery of care for 450,000 citizens, again, in Canada. Okay. I'm going to stop with that. I mean those are direct Cerner wins since we acquired Cerner. But on top of that, we have all of the -- all of -- if you will, the rest of the health care suite, which is made up of Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM, Oracle Clinical One for clinical trials. Oracle ERP for managing everything from procurement and inventory, the entire supply chain or HCM from managing the enormously complicated scheduling and paying of their professional workforce and doctors, nurses, technicians, et cetera. We're very strong in this part of the business. Our customers include the Cleveland Clinic, who use our ERP system in their hospitals and our supply chain systems; the Mayo Clinic, also ERP, supply chain and HCM to manage the workforce; Mount Sinai Hospital, ERP, SCM and HCM; then Providence St. Joseph Health, ERP, SCM, HCM and actually -- and CX customer engagement; Adventist Health, Adventist Health uses Oracle ERP, SCM, HCM and CX; Kaiser Permanente, a huge Oracle HCM user, to manage their workforce; the NHS in the UK, ERP and SCM; UnitedHealthcare, ERP and HCM; BlueCross BlueShield, ERP, HCM, HCM and CX; Humana, ERP and SCM; Highmark Health, ERP, SCM, all Fusion products or HCM; Health Care Service Corporation, you see a pattern here, ERP, HCM and CX; Independence Blue Cross, ERP and HCM; Bright Health Care, ERP. Now in this past quarter, we had major wins at Ascension Health buying ERP, HCM, SCM and HCM, where the primary competitor in HCM was Workday. As we add specific features to manage the health care workforce to our HCM product, Oracle becomes more and more successful in selling our HCM products within the health care ecosystem. So our win rates are going up dramatically. Our sales cycles are going down. University of Texas Health in San Antonio was a big HCM win there. Labcorp bought ERP and HCM, where the competitor in ERP was SAP. And the -- we won BlueRock Therapeutics, where they bought ERP, SCM and Fusion Analytic Warehouse. Again, the competitor there was SAP. And this, by the way, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG. So it was nice to win in a German company, German-owned company, ICU -- against SAP. ICU Medical expanded their HCM for vascular therapy and oncology. Dexcom, ERP, EPM, SCM; Sitel, ERP, EPM, SCM, a winner over SAP. We had some huge go-lives in the quarter. Providence Health, huge SCM customer, rolled out to 12 additional ministries. The National Healthcare in the UK, supply -- I have all the trust -- all the trust hospitals are all now live with ERP. Baptist Healthcare has now 10,000 employees live on HCM; Texas Children's Hospital, 21,000 employees live on HCM. Kelsey-Seybold Clinics are now completely live in HCM. I can go on and on, but rather than doing that, I'm just going to turn it over -- back over to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Emma, if you could please poll the audience for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: With the slowdown we're seeing across so many IaaS PaaS vendors over the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, why has OCI Gen 2 held up so well? You have born in the cloud customers, which you're seeing weakness elsewhere, you have enterprises. Is it simply low price? Is it performance? Is it you're at the right time in the economic cycle to be capturing new customers? Is there some dynamics around expiry credits that you're -- that are driving this? The difference is too stark. I think it's really important. So the more color you can give, the better.\nLarry Ellison : All right. I'd like to take a crack at that. So I'll start by check with Jensen over at NVIDIA. He and I had a very interesting conversation. Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is quite different than the other hyperscalers. We have an RDMA network, a non-blocking RDMA network. Our network is very much faster than the other guys' network. What this means is if you're running a large group of NVIDIA GPUs in a cluster doing a large AI problem at Oracle, we can build these AI clusters, these NVIDIA GPU clusters and run them. We can build those things dynamically because we use -- our standard network supports the clustering, the large clustering of GPUs and allows them to communicate very quickly. So we can create these groups of GPUs. We can marshal them together. The other guys can't do that. They can build clusters, but they actually literally are physically building a new cluster. They're building new hardware. Our existing hardware, standard network, allows us to group these things together dynamically, these GPUs together dynamically, to attack AI problems. No one else can do that. So we have a lot of business, a lot of new AI companies coming to Oracle because we're the only ones who can run their workloads. And by the way -- and we are cheaper. But so we're faster and we're cheaper. Let me give you an example where we use it ourselves. We have a partnership in health care -- back to this health care thing. We have a partnership with health care with MD Anderson Hospital, and one of our independent software vendors called Ronan, where we built these AI -- disease-specific AI modules that make recommendations to doctors about care. And then what they really say at MD Anderson, if we see a patient with these symptoms, this is how we respond. And that's a big AI model that's built by MD Anderson working with Ronan running in the Oracle Cloud. And we've actually shown or I should say MD Anderson has actually shown, if you use the system, you reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by 30%. That's a stunning number. People talk about ChatGPT being really cool because they can write my high school essay for me. Well, how about reducing the hospital readmissions at MD Anderson by 30%? You decide which is more important. But AI is fabulous stuff, yes. And ChatGPT is very cool. There are other applications other than generative language in these large language models. We've really focused on on health care in the last year or so since the acquisition of Cerner and are working diligently with others to apply AI to health care and especially the management of the complex diseases like cancer. This is a cancer AI system. But we're also doing wellness, heart disease, et cetera, down the road. We think -- so our platform runs AI very, very well because we create these clusters of GPUs that we -- that can attack big problems very quickly. We do it economically, then we build the applications on top of that. We provide the service to a lot of the startups in the AI world. This is one example of where we're just way ahead of the other hyperscalers in terms of our network and our ability to do AI. Let me point out one last AI thing. The Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't have any database administrators. It's completely self-driving. The Oracle Autonomous Database is self-driving because it is driven by -- it is an AI module that is the DBA. We've replaced the DBAs with AI inside of our own cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database actually it runs all the databases inside of the administrative part of our cloud, keeps track of all of our users, our billing, all of those things, recovery data sets, all of that stuff is now done using AI and our autonomous database. So we're a huge consumer of AI. We're a huge vendor of AI, GPU capacity, clustered capacity is -- we build AI modules in health care. And people are coming to us. NVIDIA is often recommending us as the best cloud for AI, and this is a good time to be there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy : Thank you, Larry. My question was very much related to that, but maybe from a slightly different angle. I'm wondering if you could drill into the opportunity that you do see on the generative AI side? We're repeatedly hearing that companies are running those kinds of models on OCI. NVIDIA is moving some of those workloads to the Oracle Cloud. And the other concept being that these AI models are so data hungry and that you have all the data already contained in the Fusion applications. I am curious if that piece of it, the generative AI piece, is something that you see lining up as a growth driver that is material overall on the entire business.\nLarry Ellison : The answer is absolutely yes. There's actually more demand for AI processing than there is available capacity. So -- and we're the only ones, again, that can dynamically -- and by the way -- and we're short. We are expanding as fast as we can. It's really -- it's an exciting opportunity, but it's challenging when there's more demand than supply. But the great -- the difference with us is our standard network allows us to group together these GPUs and have them attack these problems. Whether it's a medical diagnostic problem or it's a generative language problem, a la ChatGPT. So we have a lot of ISVs seeking us out because we have the -- not only do we have the most cost-effective solution, we can make the solution available to them very quickly because it runs on our standard network. So they can -- we can create a cluster for them, they run their workload. And the moment their workload is through running, we can reallocate that cluster or break that cluster up and allocate it to other users. The other guys can't do that, they can't do it dynamically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nDerrick Wood : Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo my congratulations, especially on sustaining very high OCI growth. Larry, one area we've been doing more work on is how cloud vendors can help transform the telco market, including migrating their IT infrastructure and their network operations to the public cloud, which should lead to greater efficiencies and also give them a more effective platform to roll out new 5G and edge application services. I know you guys touched on this a bit at last year's Analyst Day, but I was just hoping to get an update on how you're thinking about that telco opportunity with the Oracle Stack, especially with OCI? Who's some of the telco operators you're partnering with? And how you see this playing out over the next couple of years? Yes. This is an exciting business for us. I mean, we're actually creating dedicated data centers for Vodafone. I'm not sure how many we've already built as yet. But if you will, Vodafone is moving a substantial part of their business into the Oracle Cloud. And again, we have this ability to build data centers for customers. And those data centers are OCI data centers that we run for them, but they are dedicated to workloads at a particular customer. Nomura, the first of them we built a few years ago in Japan for Nomura. And they have a primary and now they have a backup, they run the Tokyo Stock Exchange on that, and they sell it into financial services in Japan. But that's an OCI data center that we built for Nomura, where they're reselling the capabilities. Vodafone is again another example of someone who were building dedicated data -- these are OCI data centers that we run there. In our constellation of data centers, they look like all the other OCI data centers. They're automated like all the other OCI data centers. So we take advantage of those economies of scale and that skilled labor that runs them. And a lot -- again, a lot of it is AI, but a lot of it we still have human beings. We've done that for Vodafone. Same thing with DISH Network's entry into telephony is enabled by similar architectural approach using OCI. I can go on and on. But we have -- but it's one of our industries of emphasis. And I think you'll see us -- and that's going to be a huge area of growth for us. As telcos, we've always been very strong in telcos. And now they're beginning to move to the cloud. And we're seeing some major commitments from some of our largest customers around the world. We're also seeing financial services companies take a slightly different point of view, but where they want to keep things, if you will, \"on-premise.\" But since we can build an OCI region and dedicate it to a bank, there we're doing more, if you will, call it, clouded customer where we built a dedicated region for a financial service. Nomura was an example, Nomura in Japan, but there are other examples. We build these clouds for banks.  So I mean, huge industries moving to the cloud in a slightly different way than other industries, not moving to public cloud, but rather preferring to have these dedicated regions. So it's just their application, just their applications in this cloud. We have the ability to do that. Again, the Amazon does not, and Microsoft does not, and Google does not.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci : I think this question is for Safra. We've heard a lot about your committed cloud mega deals, but you sometimes have talked about pure consumption or pay-as-you-go deals. Other vendors that employ the pay-as-you-go model, such as Mongo and even Snowflake, to some extent, who had been getting a ton of traction in the market, have either seen or they anticipate dramatic slowdowns. We haven't seen anything like that in your results at all and certainly not in your guidance. But can you talk about your exposure to such deals and how they're progressing?\nSafra Catz : So as Larry was touching on it, we have many, many enterprise customers, phone companies, banks, governments who make commitments to us as part of their move to cloud. So we do have some pay-as-you-go customers, but the bulk of our revenue, first of all, our SaaS revenue, as you know, you implement an accounting system, you're not going to pay less tomorrow. You still have to run your accounting system. So the SaaS side of the business, again, is fully committed. And then because we have so many important enterprise customers who are bringing basically their crown jewels into our cloud and had been waiting really for us to be in the position to receive those, they want to have a two-way commitment. They want to know that we have the capacity for them, and they want to get a slightly better price. So first of all, those that go into the public cloud, whether it's Telecom Italia or Verizon or some of these others, they obviously would like a better price, so they make commitments to come in, usually committing less than they expect to use, and almost always, over using more than they expected. However, other customers have cloud customers, as Larry mentioned, or other different arrangements, the alloy arrangement where we have a combination with the telco or a data center provider, those are all committed. And so we're very -- we're very strong in the commitments from our customers. And by the way, they want to make sure we have available capacity back for them because many of them get rid of their data centers when they're finished. And that's the ultimate goal for them. They don't want to be running back and forth. These aren't toy workloads. These are critical workloads for their business, and they want to know that they've got a place to put those.\nJohn DiFucci : So the commitment is these -- a lot of these, it sounds like these people are committed to ramping up to the full capacity of their data center and not until they do that, do they shut down for the most part their -- the data centers they're replacing?\nSafra Catz : Yes. \nJohn DiFucci : Okay.\nSafra Catz: Yes. Just so that we're clear here. Pay-as-you-go at Oracle is less than 5% of our business. Okay?\nJohn DiFucci : Okay.\nSafra Catz : Okay. Is that helpful?\nJohn DiFucci : That's very clear. Thank you very much, Safra.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick : Larry, as I think about the strong momentum in Cerner, expanding the contract base by $5 billion and your expectations for the business to accelerate, can you parse through the drivers in terms of new logo win rates versus the expansion in cross-sell you're doing with Fusion, for example? And then also, Larry, you touched on the idea of a single medical record. People have been talking about this for decades. When does it become clear that Oracle is helping improve the quality of care and saving lives? And I've got a quick follow-up for Safra if Ken will allow.\nLarry Ellison : Well, I think there are two things. One is the system we're putting in for the DoD and for the VA is one patient, one record. So that's a model of it. The one going in, in Nova Scotia is the same. We are bidding on a huge contract for the NHS. Again, some of these contracts are enormous and the responsibility to go along with the contracts is also enormous. But our system, that's how our system works. Our standard system that we have built is one patient, one record in the database. So if you visit Stanford and UCLA and Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, even if you go to these four different providers for a variety of different issues, all of your data will be in one database. All your patient data will be in one place immediately accessible in a time of emergency or just a routine visit to the doctor. That's how our system is architected. That's how we're delivering it to us to customers right now. It's attracted a lot of attention. Actually, it's not only much better for the patient, helps deliver better -- gives doctors better information, deliver better outcomes, but it's also less expensive to do it that way than every hospital maintaining their own system to -- rather -- it's better that they should share a system in the cloud and integrate their data for the benefit of the patient. Saving lives is exactly what it's doing -- what's happening with our partner at Ronan and our partner at MD Anderson and other partnerships I could go into in more detail, and I'm happy to but not on this call, is these disease-specific AI modules where -- and the telemedicine modules that we're delivering, allows a patient in a community hospital in Montana to get the benefits of the wisdom of the best specialty cancer specialists at MD Anderson Hospital in Texas or a Memorial Sloan Kettering doc in New York or a Mass General doctor who's on faculty at Harvard Medical School. The fact that we're now using AI and telemedicine and instrumenting these diagnostic devices so the docs -- so -- in the community hospital, we have diagnostic devices that the Harvard faculty, then there at Mass General can look at and then they inspect the AI module to, a, gather much better information. And with that better information, have the best minds and AI -- real minds and artificial intelligence processing that information and prescribing, hopefully, the best procedure or the best medication for that particular patient, which translates into reducing readmission to the hospital as they did at MD Anderson and ultimately saving lives.\nBrad Zelnick : The mission is so important. If I could just sneak in a quick one for Safra to follow up. Safra, 30% organic cloud growth for the year implies significant acceleration in Q4. What supports your confidence in delivering that?\nSafra Catz : Well, remember, as I told you, we have dropped a large number of data centers. And as they become available, we have customers waiting to get started and use them. So we have commitments from customers to quite an enormous amount of consumption. And so they've basically been waiting for us. We've -- it's taken a while in all these different countries to open these data centers and to make them available to our customers. And so we know they are actually very impatient to use the capacity as it becomes available. And we just have a lot of momentum and a lot of commitment from our customers and a lot of enthusiasm around our offerings. And so this is -- that's how the math works.\nKen Bond : Thank you, Brad and Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 represented another great quarter with continued momentum on the top and bottom line. But before I get to the numbers, I want to share with you a few thoughts that explain what's behind our continued financial success. First, our cloud offerings drive operational efficiency. In fact, one of our competitors recently coined the term, the Oracle playbook, which I absolutely love, because the Oracle playbook is all about doing more while spending less. As you all know, we started this ourselves over 20 years ago and have kept it up over all these years, resulting in the highest margins in the software business for decades. Using our own products and services enables us to increase our investments for growth, while also growing profitability, including through acquisitions as well as during our move to the cloud. We are constantly talking with our customers about leveraging Oracle technology to accelerate their speed to market and reduce cost, all the while improving the experience they deliver to their customers. The combination of Oracle's infrastructure and apps, which is unique in the cloud market, increases the intensity of business transformation. Cloud is no longer about just renting commodity white boxes. It's about velocity and value. We have become the enterprise technology vendor of choice because we have products and services that help our customers drive cost efficiencies and modernize their businesses. Second, while AI has been dominating the recent news cycle, the truth is that our Fusion and Infrastructure customers have been using AI as an integral part of their business for some time. Oracle Fusion, with embedded AI, enables customers to close their books in days, not weeks. Oracle AI provides more relevant sales leads. Oracle AI increases infrastructure performance and security with no human intervention. And customers using OCI get AI as a service to help drive their own business transformation. Given our scale and our information advantage across industries and technologies, we are constantly training our applications to do more for our customers, whether it's further what our customers get when they use our platform. And on our Gen 2 OCI platform, the architecture and unique network capability has fast become the platform of choice for many AI companies because OCI runs workloads faster. And time is money in the cloud. So coming to us saves our customers money. Third, customers are putting Oracle's comprehensive and powerful ways to accelerate their businesses. The Uber win was notable because we have yet another example of an industry-transforming company concluding that Oracle's cloud, performance and security exceeds that of our competitors and at a price point that represents a sustainable long-term partnership. Uber will use more of our technology to drive value in their own business. And you're going to see a rising list of these types of strategic wins pile up in the quarters to come. Finally, before I move to the numbers, and hopefully, no one missed this fact, that we're announcing our earnings nine days after the close of the quarter, and we expect to file the Q right away. We continue to set the standard in operating efficiency which helps customers see what's possible when they are working with us.  Okay. Now to the Q3 results. As always, I'll discuss them using constant currency growth rate to provide a full picture both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some revenue results excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, including Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 48% in constant currency, with IaaS revenue of $1.2 billion, up 57% and SaaS revenue of $2.9 billion, up 44%. Now excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 28% in constant currency at $3.5 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.9 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.2 billion and up 33% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, also including support, were $4.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.3 billion and was up 16%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.2 billion and grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up against 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 26% this quarter. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 57% in constant currency. And when you exclude our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 65%, with an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 86%, cloud customer consumption revenue, up 73%, and autonomous database, up 50%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 3% in constant currency, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 40%. Database's subscription revenue is largely made up of on-premise database support. But as these databases migrate from on-premise to the cloud and cloud customer, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside back-office SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenue, including Cerner, were $1.3 billion, up 4% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 21% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing organic revenue growth to be negatively affected by 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 63% of cloud services and license support revenue. Now because our cloud services are growing so fast, it's down to 55%. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6% excluding Cerner. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.2 billion, up 11% from last year. The operating margin, including Cerner, was 42% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. For example, while we have only owned Cerner for three quarters, we have already improved its operating margin by over 5 percentage points compared to before the acquisition. And by the way, I actually expect this year, FY 2023, the one we are closing out in one more quarter, will be the trough year for operating margins and percentages as our margin improvement initiatives play out. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.4% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.22 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, up 13% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars. At quarter end, we had nearly $8.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.6 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.5 billion, and free cash flow was $7.3 billion with capital expenditures of $8.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 11% at $4.3 billion. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $62.3 billion, up 66% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner, which Larry will discuss in a moment. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate was 26% in constant currency. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx this quarter was $2.6 billion as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand you see reflected in the RPO as well as what we see in our pipeline, I expect that our CapEx investments will be about where it is right now for the foreseeable future. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. We now have 41 public cloud regions around the world with another 8 being built. In addition, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many cloud customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions and another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more.  As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% from $0.32 to $0.40 per share. Our financial strategy remains focused on growing non-GAAP operating and pre-tax income while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given increasing customer interest in our cloud technologies, we will continue to prudently invest to meet this demand. As a reminder, because now we're going to talk about Q4, last Q4, we had a spectacular double-digit revenue growth rate, highlighted by 25% constant currency growth in software license. With our continued migration to the cloud, we expect that we will continue to win big deals that are more subscription driven than license driven. These big subscription wins add to the backlog and are recognized over time rather than upfront. That is exactly what we want to see as our cloud business continues to see excellent growth. So now let me turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency would have a 2% negative effect on total revenue and at least 3% plus negative effect on EPS in Q4. But as I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be very different by quarter end. Okay. Here we go. Total revenues for Q4, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in constant currency, and thus are expected to grow 15 to 17 in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% in constant currency, 49 to 51 in USD. I expect total cloud growth for Q4, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. I expect growth in operating profit to be double digits. As you all know, my non-GAAP tax rate guidance is typically 20.5. However, our tax rates over the last two years and Q4 have averaged around 11%, and I anticipate that in Q4, the most likely outcome is a non-GAAP tax rate of around 14.5%. And we've used this rate in determining our EPS guidance for Q4. Now mind you, that's comparing it to 11 or 10.5, I think, last year. Regardless, like past quarters, the actual tax rate for Q4 could be higher or lower and affect our actual EPS. With that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% and 5% and between $1.59 and $1.63 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% and 3% and be between $1.56 and $1.60 in USD.  What have I got here? Anyway, as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q4. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. So as Larry was touching on it, we have many, many enterprise customers, phone companies, banks, governments who make commitments to us as part of their move to cloud. So we do have some pay-as-you-go customers, but the bulk of our revenue, first of all, our SaaS revenue, as you know, you implement an accounting system, you're not going to pay less tomorrow. You still have to run your accounting system. So the SaaS side of the business, again, is fully committed. And then because we have so many important enterprise customers who are bringing basically their crown jewels into our cloud and had been waiting really for us to be in the position to receive those, they want to have a two-way commitment. They want to know that we have the capacity for them, and they want to get a slightly better price. So first of all, those that go into the public cloud, whether it's Telecom Italia or Verizon or some of these others, they obviously would like a better price, so they make commitments to come in, usually committing less than they expect to use, and almost always, over using more than they expected. However, other customers have cloud customers, as Larry mentioned, or other different arrangements, the alloy arrangement where we have a combination with the telco or a data center provider, those are all committed. And so we're very -- we're very strong in the commitments from our customers. And by the way, they want to make sure we have available capacity back for them because many of them get rid of their data centers when they're finished. And that's the ultimate goal for them. They don't want to be running back and forth. These aren't toy workloads. These are critical workloads for their business, and they want to know that they've got a place to put those. Yes. Yes. Just so that we're clear here. Pay-as-you-go at Oracle is less than 5% of our business. Okay? Okay. Is that helpful? Well, remember, as I told you, we have dropped a large number of data centers. And as they become available, we have customers waiting to get started and use them. So we have commitments from customers to quite an enormous amount of consumption. And so they've basically been waiting for us. We've -- it's taken a while in all these different countries to open these data centers and to make them available to our customers. And so we know they are actually very impatient to use the capacity as it becomes available. And we just have a lot of momentum and a lot of commitment from our customers and a lot of enthusiasm around our offerings. And so this is -- that's how the math works."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Since June of last year, when we acquired Cerner, that business has increased its health care contract base by approximately $5 billion. We have signed a diverse set of new and expanding domestic and international customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, hospital groups in a dozen U.S. states, multiple hospitals in the United Kingdom, multiple provinces in Canada, the Australian Defence Forces, multiple hospitals in Puerto Rico and multiple countries in the Middle East. While we are pleased with this early success of the Cerner business, we expect the signing of new health care contracts to accelerate over the next few quarters. Well, the Cerner business has been booking billions of dollars in Millennium Clinical and electronic health record systems for hundreds of hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The overall Oracle Healthcare application portfolio is actually much broader, covering virtually the entire health care ecosystem. Hospitals are also buying the Oracle Fusion ERP system to manage their revenue cycle and from reimbursements -- from insurance companies to patient billing, plus their medical supply chain from ordering to inventory. Hospitals are buying Fusion HCM to manage their complex high-value workforce of doctors, nurses and technicians. Pharmaceutical companies are buying Oracle Clinical One to manage clinical trials. Government health organizations, public health organizations are using aggregated EHR data to monitor infectious disease and respond to outbreaks quickly and efficiently. Now I'd like to take a couple of minutes and go over a little more specifically some of the Cerner wins since we bought the company. One was a huge win at Labcorp and Ascension Health to deploy a single lab information system domain for 96 separate hospital-based labs across 10 states. Another one in Puerto Rico, Auxilio Mutuo, is an all-new electronic health record footprint to deploy in a 600-plus bed academic private hospital, replacing Altera, Paragon with Cerner Millennium. Vandalia Health, formerly Charleston Area Medical Center, consolidated all their EMRs into a single unified domain and added four new hospitals. UHS modernized their revenue cycle, migrated to CareAware with the CareAware Cloud and -- for their hospitals and ambulatory clinics. Banner Health implemented a complete revenue cycle management for their health business. The VA deployed our unified electronic health record system to 19 additional sites. The Department of Defense deployed Oracle Cerner EHR to all the OCONUS locations in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense. In the UK, at the National Health Service, Sheffield Teaching Hospital deployed the full suite of Cerner applications across three additional sites and the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The Princess Alexandra Hospital, also in the NHS, is a 430-bed hospital that added the full Cerner suite. Mubadala Health was the first Cerner Millennium client to move from the Cerner data center directly now to the OCI Cloud. As we move our Cerner patients from the Cerner data centers into the Oracle OCI Cloud, we expect to get much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower our costs of providing that cloud service. OCI is just much more efficient than the Cerner data centers that we acquired. We've deployed the full EHR footprint, Cerner footprint to four Sheikh Khalifa Hospitals in the U.A.E. with a capacity of 1,200 beds, serving a population of 1.4 million citizens, again, in the U.A.E. The Australian Department of Defense, we delivered acute care capabilities and deployed an environment for all of the Australian Defence hospitals and field hospitals. In Canada, starting in Nova Scotia, we deployed a one-patient, one-record EHR system across the province for the citizens of Nova Scotia. One-patient, one-record, as you know, I've discussed a long time the fact that patient electronic health records are scattered across every provider they visit. That problem is now being solved in Nova Scotia by having a single unified patient record for every patient regardless of which provider they visit. Their records are still all in one place. Same thing in Niagara Health, a new HR footprint to support delivery of care for 450,000 citizens, again, in Canada. Okay. I'm going to stop with that. I mean those are direct Cerner wins since we acquired Cerner. But on top of that, we have all of the -- all of -- if you will, the rest of the health care suite, which is made up of Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM, Oracle Clinical One for clinical trials. Oracle ERP for managing everything from procurement and inventory, the entire supply chain or HCM from managing the enormously complicated scheduling and paying of their professional workforce and doctors, nurses, technicians, et cetera. We're very strong in this part of the business. Our customers include the Cleveland Clinic, who use our ERP system in their hospitals and our supply chain systems; the Mayo Clinic, also ERP, supply chain and HCM to manage the workforce; Mount Sinai Hospital, ERP, SCM and HCM; then Providence St. Joseph Health, ERP, SCM, HCM and actually -- and CX customer engagement; Adventist Health, Adventist Health uses Oracle ERP, SCM, HCM and CX; Kaiser Permanente, a huge Oracle HCM user, to manage their workforce; the NHS in the UK, ERP and SCM; UnitedHealthcare, ERP and HCM; BlueCross BlueShield, ERP, HCM, HCM and CX; Humana, ERP and SCM; Highmark Health, ERP, SCM, all Fusion products or HCM; Health Care Service Corporation, you see a pattern here, ERP, HCM and CX; Independence Blue Cross, ERP and HCM; Bright Health Care, ERP. Now in this past quarter, we had major wins at Ascension Health buying ERP, HCM, SCM and HCM, where the primary competitor in HCM was Workday. As we add specific features to manage the health care workforce to our HCM product, Oracle becomes more and more successful in selling our HCM products within the health care ecosystem. So our win rates are going up dramatically. Our sales cycles are going down. University of Texas Health in San Antonio was a big HCM win there. Labcorp bought ERP and HCM, where the competitor in ERP was SAP. And the -- we won BlueRock Therapeutics, where they bought ERP, SCM and Fusion Analytic Warehouse. Again, the competitor there was SAP. And this, by the way, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG. So it was nice to win in a German company, German-owned company, ICU -- against SAP. ICU Medical expanded their HCM for vascular therapy and oncology. Dexcom, ERP, EPM, SCM; Sitel, ERP, EPM, SCM, a winner over SAP. We had some huge go-lives in the quarter. Providence Health, huge SCM customer, rolled out to 12 additional ministries. The National Healthcare in the UK, supply -- I have all the trust -- all the trust hospitals are all now live with ERP. Baptist Healthcare has now 10,000 employees live on HCM; Texas Children's Hospital, 21,000 employees live on HCM. Kelsey-Seybold Clinics are now completely live in HCM. I can go on and on, but rather than doing that, I'm just going to turn it over -- back over to Safra. All right. I'd like to take a crack at that. So I'll start by check with Jensen over at NVIDIA. He and I had a very interesting conversation. Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is quite different than the other hyperscalers. We have an RDMA network, a non-blocking RDMA network. Our network is very much faster than the other guys' network. What this means is if you're running a large group of NVIDIA GPUs in a cluster doing a large AI problem at Oracle, we can build these AI clusters, these NVIDIA GPU clusters and run them. We can build those things dynamically because we use -- our standard network supports the clustering, the large clustering of GPUs and allows them to communicate very quickly. So we can create these groups of GPUs. We can marshal them together. The other guys can't do that. They can build clusters, but they actually literally are physically building a new cluster. They're building new hardware. Our existing hardware, standard network, allows us to group these things together dynamically, these GPUs together dynamically, to attack AI problems. No one else can do that. So we have a lot of business, a lot of new AI companies coming to Oracle because we're the only ones who can run their workloads. And by the way -- and we are cheaper. But so we're faster and we're cheaper. Let me give you an example where we use it ourselves. We have a partnership in health care -- back to this health care thing. We have a partnership with health care with MD Anderson Hospital, and one of our independent software vendors called Ronan, where we built these AI -- disease-specific AI modules that make recommendations to doctors about care. And then what they really say at MD Anderson, if we see a patient with these symptoms, this is how we respond. And that's a big AI model that's built by MD Anderson working with Ronan running in the Oracle Cloud. And we've actually shown or I should say MD Anderson has actually shown, if you use the system, you reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by 30%. That's a stunning number. People talk about ChatGPT being really cool because they can write my high school essay for me. Well, how about reducing the hospital readmissions at MD Anderson by 30%? You decide which is more important. But AI is fabulous stuff, yes. And ChatGPT is very cool. There are other applications other than generative language in these large language models. We've really focused on on health care in the last year or so since the acquisition of Cerner and are working diligently with others to apply AI to health care and especially the management of the complex diseases like cancer. This is a cancer AI system. But we're also doing wellness, heart disease, et cetera, down the road. We think -- so our platform runs AI very, very well because we create these clusters of GPUs that we -- that can attack big problems very quickly. We do it economically, then we build the applications on top of that. We provide the service to a lot of the startups in the AI world. This is one example of where we're just way ahead of the other hyperscalers in terms of our network and our ability to do AI. Let me point out one last AI thing. The Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't have any database administrators. It's completely self-driving. The Oracle Autonomous Database is self-driving because it is driven by -- it is an AI module that is the DBA. We've replaced the DBAs with AI inside of our own cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database actually it runs all the databases inside of the administrative part of our cloud, keeps track of all of our users, our billing, all of those things, recovery data sets, all of that stuff is now done using AI and our autonomous database. So we're a huge consumer of AI. We're a huge vendor of AI, GPU capacity, clustered capacity is -- we build AI modules in health care. And people are coming to us. NVIDIA is often recommending us as the best cloud for AI, and this is a good time to be there. The answer is absolutely yes. There's actually more demand for AI processing than there is available capacity. So -- and we're the only ones, again, that can dynamically -- and by the way -- and we're short. We are expanding as fast as we can. It's really -- it's an exciting opportunity, but it's challenging when there's more demand than supply. But the great -- the difference with us is our standard network allows us to group together these GPUs and have them attack these problems. Whether it's a medical diagnostic problem or it's a generative language problem, a la ChatGPT. So we have a lot of ISVs seeking us out because we have the -- not only do we have the most cost-effective solution, we can make the solution available to them very quickly because it runs on our standard network. So they can -- we can create a cluster for them, they run their workload. And the moment their workload is through running, we can reallocate that cluster or break that cluster up and allocate it to other users. The other guys can't do that, they can't do it dynamically. Well, I think there are two things. One is the system we're putting in for the DoD and for the VA is one patient, one record. So that's a model of it. The one going in, in Nova Scotia is the same. We are bidding on a huge contract for the NHS. Again, some of these contracts are enormous and the responsibility to go along with the contracts is also enormous. But our system, that's how our system works. Our standard system that we have built is one patient, one record in the database. So if you visit Stanford and UCLA and Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, even if you go to these four different providers for a variety of different issues, all of your data will be in one database. All your patient data will be in one place immediately accessible in a time of emergency or just a routine visit to the doctor. That's how our system is architected. That's how we're delivering it to us to customers right now. It's attracted a lot of attention. Actually, it's not only much better for the patient, helps deliver better -- gives doctors better information, deliver better outcomes, but it's also less expensive to do it that way than every hospital maintaining their own system to -- rather -- it's better that they should share a system in the cloud and integrate their data for the benefit of the patient. Saving lives is exactly what it's doing -- what's happening with our partner at Ronan and our partner at MD Anderson and other partnerships I could go into in more detail, and I'm happy to but not on this call, is these disease-specific AI modules where -- and the telemedicine modules that we're delivering, allows a patient in a community hospital in Montana to get the benefits of the wisdom of the best specialty cancer specialists at MD Anderson Hospital in Texas or a Memorial Sloan Kettering doc in New York or a Mass General doctor who's on faculty at Harvard Medical School. The fact that we're now using AI and telemedicine and instrumenting these diagnostic devices so the docs -- so -- in the community hospital, we have diagnostic devices that the Harvard faculty, then there at Mass General can look at and then they inspect the AI module to, a, gather much better information. And with that better information, have the best minds and AI -- real minds and artificial intelligence processing that information and prescribing, hopefully, the best procedure or the best medication for that particular patient, which translates into reducing readmission to the hospital as they did at MD Anderson and ultimately saving lives."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Oracle Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers\u2019 prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations at Oracle. Please go ahead.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Bo. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website as well. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, simply put, we had an outstanding quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was more than $200 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 25% in constant currency. Even excluding Cerner, total revenue grew 9% in constant currency that\u2019s higher than Q1 and on top of a revenue beat this time last year. The strength of the quarter is even more amazing, given that the currency headwind was higher than what it was when I gave guidance with 6% for revenue and a $0.095 headwind for earnings per share. And yet, we still exceeded the high end of my USD guidance for both, total revenue and earnings per share. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to experience clear company-specific and product-specific momentum. The reasons are many, but it boils down to a few key points of differentiation. First, more and more customers are recognizing our second-generation infrastructure cloud as being fundamentally better architected for higher performance, better security and unmatched reliability versus the older first-generation hyperscale cloud providers. Second, customers appreciate the flexibility of our service and business model that enables them to deploy our technologies where it serves them best, whether that be in the public cloud, in dedicated regions around the world or in a true clouded customer implementation. And third, customers recognize the value of an end-to-end integrated stack of applications, both horizontal, like ERP and HCM and supply chain, and industry-specific applications that focus on their industries. And all of it is on our Gen 2 infrastructure, which is designed perfectly for them as they move through. As customers increasingly look to better value out of their technology investments, many discover that Oracle is much better compared to other alternatives. Gartner formerly recognized OCI by moving us to Visionary status in its cloud infrastructure and platform services report for the first time. In addition, last week, we were awarded a JWCC award at the U.S. Department of Defense as they also recognized our capabilities. As all of these differentiators come together and our business continues to accelerate, we expect organic growth for our fiscal year 2023 cloud revenues will be over 30% in constant currency. Now to the numbers. As always, I\u2019ll discuss our results using constant currency growth rate. To provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise, I\u2019m going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the revenue results excluding Cerner, so you can see what\u2019s going on. Total cloud revenue, now that\u2019s SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.8 billion, up 48% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, $1.1 billion, up 59% and SaaS revenue of $2.8 billion, up 45%. Now, excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS was up 27% in constant currency at $3.3 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.6 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and, of course, our Generation 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.1 billion, up 35% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.3 billion, up 9% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.2 billion and was up 16%. Now, our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.9 billion and grew 26% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 59% in constant currency. Now excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 69% with an annualized revenue of $3.8 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 88% and cloud and customer consumption revenue, up 83% and autonomous database up 50%. Software license revenues, including Cerner, were $1.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency and up 9% without Cerner. What is increasingly resonating with customers is that in an environment where IT investments need to have a fast and tangible return on investment, only Oracle offers customers the flexibility to manage their technology estate, so they can deploy incremental investments where it brings them the most immediate value. It also helps that the purchase of technology licenses from Oracle enables them to move to the cloud as they are ready, effectively providing an on-ramp to Oracle Cloud services. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.3 billion, up 25% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner\u2019s revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up over 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing total revenue growth to be negatively affected by over 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 65% of the total number of cloud services and license support revenue. Now, it\u2019s down to 53%, and this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support. By the way, license support grew 4% this year. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved again this quarter, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve in response to accelerating demand we have continued to build data center capacity. We have seen that as those centers fill up, margins go up like they did this quarter. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6%, excluding Cerner in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin, including Cerner, was 41% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle levels and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. Further, I expect that this year, will be the trough year for operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4. I think I guided to 20.5. So basically, it worked out where we thought. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, down 1% in USD, up 7% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.63. At quarter end, we had nearly $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.7 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.1 billion and free cash flow was $8.4 billion with capital expenditures of $6.7 billion. In addition, we now have 40 public cloud regions around the world with another 9 being built. In addition, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We also have many cloud customer implementations, dedicated regions in another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more as customers want to have their data protected in their country. We are careful to pace our investments appropriately, but need to continue to build to meet our accelerating demand. CapEx this quarter was $2.4 billion as we continued to invest in our cloud to meet this accelerating demand. With triple-digit IaaS bookings growth the last couple of quarters we now expect to spend about this amount per quarter for the next few quarters as we build capacity for our customers\u2019 needs. This level of spend though will not negatively impact our operating margins as we scale. When I talk about accelerating demand, that demand is reflected in the remaining performance obligation or RPO balance, which is now at $61.2 billion, up 68% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as to Cerner. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate in constant currency accelerated to 28% in Q2, up from 22% last quarter and approximately 48% of the total RPO is to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Now, as we\u2019ve said before, I know you\u2019re tired of me saying it, but I will, we are continuing -- we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for a total of $448 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as there is strong demand for our cloud services. So now, let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I\u2019ll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Using currency exchange rates as they are right now, currency should have a 4% negative effect on total revenue and at least a $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q3. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end, but we\u2019ve got to use a number, so we\u2019re using the number right now. Total revenues for Q3, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and 43% to 47% in USD. I expect the total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency. Again, due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $1.17 and $1.21 in USD. And as I\u2019ve said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q3. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19% last year. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Okay. I\u2019m going to go over -- primarily, I\u2019m going to go over customers and new wins in infrastructure and then customers and wins and go-lives in applications. But I\u2019m going to start with infrastructure. So, during Q2, we signed multiple customers to contracts exceeding $1 billion, infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 billion. Let me be clear, multiple customers signed contracts for $1 billion worth of infrastructure. So, given -- that\u2019s been added to our backlog, we expect our infrastructure business to continue to grow very, very strongly into the future. We now have 22,000 infrastructure customers. We have a total of 55 regions. That\u2019s public regions plus national security regions and the other kinds of regions and that\u2019s more than AWS or Microsoft or anybody, which may surprise some people. Gartner, as Safra mentioned, moved us into the Visionary Quadrant for the first time. So, let me just start naming specific customers and give you a flavor. I\u2019m going to name large customers, small customers. I\u2019m going to focus a little bit on a bunch of international customers to let you know that our investment in data centers all over the world is really paying off. So, our customers include -- big customers include, FedEx, Deutsche Bank, Tokyo Stock Exchange. Let me take a moment to emphasize Tokyo Stock Exchange. We\u2019re the only ones running a major stock exchange. And this is -- Tokyo is not the only one because our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable. It doesn\u2019t go down. In fact, my favorite quote from a big phone company in the United States was the difference between Oracle\u2019s Cloud and the other clouds are simply that Oracle Cloud doesn\u2019t go down. I think that\u2019s a very important issue when you have enterprise applications like a stock exchange where you can\u2019t ever go down. Fujitsu is another big customer; Vodafone that\u2019s phone company has similar problems. If you\u2019re a phone company, the phone system can\u2019t go down. Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Enbridge; Kaiser, a huge health care company in the -- primarily in the United States. NVIDIA has moved and a bunch of others have moved, lots of AI, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads to the Oracle Cloud because it turns out we\u2019re really good at that. We\u2019re better than that than any of the other clouds, which may surprise some people. Schneider Electric, Telecom Italia, Verizon and lots, lots more. I\u2019m not just going to list them all. We publish a big list at oracle.com and every quarter, we add new customers to that. So, in the quarter, we added United Airlines -- database wins in the quarter, United Airlines, migrating all flight operations to the Oracle Exadata cloud. Albertsons, again, moving to the Exadata cloud service database. Mitsui in Japan, again, moving their databases to Oracle. Again, this is the beginning of a very major, very large business for us as our database franchise moves primarily from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. Persol Career, a big professional services company in Japan, migrating to -- or moving their Oracle databases to the cloud. Unimed, LAD Healthcare, once again moving their databases to the Oracle Cloud. Penske Truck Leasing, doing using -- moving to autonomous database. HomeServe plc in the UK, government agency is moving the autonomous transaction processing system. So, they\u2019re not just moving an existing Oracle database to the cloud, they\u2019re upgrading from our on-premise Oracle database to our autonomous database, which is only available in the cloud. Iberia Express, a big telco, same thing moving to autonomous data warehouse. They just -- the idea is the autonomous data warehouse makes database administration very simple. In fact, it\u2019s entirely automated. There is no database administration. Delgado [ph] Auto Taxi, again, in APAC, a smaller company, again, moving their databases to autonomous system. MaxiTRANS, big transportation company in Australia, same thing, autonomous transaction processing. The Scroll, [ph] a big Japanese wholesale company, autonomous -- moving to autonomous database. Banco Safra, this is -- by the way, this is not -- our CEO does not own a bank. This is not an internal -- she didn\u2019t not buy our database. But there\u2019s a big bank in Latin America called Banco Safra and they\u2019re moving all their mission-critical apps to OCI, as is Bradesco, same thing. Yorkshire Building Society in the UK, again, autonomous data warehouse. And Nestl\u00e9, a food giant in EMEA is moving their analytics systems to autonomous data warehouse and that\u2019s a huge customer. Okay. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we have a new version of our MySQL open source database, and we added a new ultrafast query processor called HeatWave to MySQL and that\u2019s doing extremely well. We have a number of companies doing that migration. Medallia, Infonow [ph] Credit Club. It\u2019s a long list of people that are moving to MySQL to take advantage of the fact that our query processor in our version of MySQL is 100 times faster. I really mean that. And we have all the benchmarks. We publish all the benchmarks, and we publish the source code of the benchmarks, so you can duplicate those results, 100 times faster than queries than the Amazon equivalent called Aurora; Aurora, Amazon\u2019s version of MySQL. As Safra mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft Azure is going extremely well. We have a number of companies running applications in Azure. And then Azure is connected to OCI, so the database is in OCI and the application is in Azure. The Belgium Railways is one. Honeywell in the United States, Petronas [ph] the big energy and utility company, Telecom Italia Mobile A [ph], but that multi-cloud system is doing extremely well. And we think that is the future of cloud. We think the future of cloud is not 4-walled gardens, AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle. We think those clouds are all going to interconnect. And then customers will pick the most appropriate service for their particular needs and mix and match between the clouds. Okay. A lot more -- a major city in the southwest, which I\u2019m not allowed to mention is literally migrating everything to OCI. Lambda, which is a big AI machine learning specialist company is moving the bulk of their workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs and our fast -- our very, very fast network to interconnect them. And this is a pattern. Lambda is doing that, Latent Space is doing that. NVIDIA themselves are doing that. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads moving from other clouds to OCI because we\u2019re faster. And again, in the cloud business faster -- when you charge by the minute, faster means cheaper. Give me 1 second. Alexa, be quite. Sorry about that. I think Jeff Bezos did that. Okay. So, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, National Institute of Health. These are all new cloud customers, new infrastructure cloud customers -- again from very large to medium-sized companies are moving to OCI and lots of them. Twist Biosciences is moving healthcare -- again, AI workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs. AIA Life Insurance Company, a big financial services company, again, is moving to OCI and databases to OCI. In India, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, a giant utility, is moving all of their metering and billing applications to OCI. Win Win [ph] Intelligent Information Technology is moving their IoT platform from AWS to OCI, and they\u2019re also using MySQL HeatWave. Algar Telecom, Brazilian Stock Exchange, Claro, again, big media telco, moving to OCI; Ncell. Unimed Curitiba, a large health care company in Latin America moving to OCI; Vivo, again, moving to OCI. Banco de Chile, E-Banks [ph] another financial services company; Rabobank. DP World, the transportation and logistics company in the Middle East, Austin TranSit Partnership, a municipality in Texas they\u2019re perfect -- an interesting customer because they\u2019ve been using Oracle ERP and EPM and our applications for a long time. Now they\u2019re moving their infrastructure to OCI. Oman Telecommunications. A huge French telecommunication company, I\u2019m not allowed to mention. They\u2019re moving to OCI. Oxford Nanopore, a big -- a gene sequencing company is moving from AWS to OCI where they are going to store gene sequencing, but not only just store gene sequences in OCI, they also do analytics to figure out if -- what they\u2019ve sequenced is a new version of COVID-19 or another pathogen, if the pathogen they\u2019ve never seen before, extremely important application for world health. Reed Exhibitions, Saudi Ministry of Media, Ecobank, financial services in EMEA, GlobeMed Limited, Morrisons, a big retail operation, again, all moving to on OCI. HDFC Bank and Waafi Bank, I\u2019m going to stop there, but we published a long list, but there\u2019s tremendous momentum, tremendous momentum and a large number of customers from all over the world, very large and medium-sized companies moving to OCI, and the business is growing very strongly, as Safra pointed out in the numbers. Okay. In the back -- in applications, I\u2019ll try to do this quickly. We\u2019re just winning in the back office. We have 22,000 customers in infrastructure and the cloud. We have 11,000 Fusion ERP and HCM customers alone in applications, just Fusion customers. We have 11,000 now. We have probably close to 30,000, 30,000 NetSuite customers on top of that. So, we have a lot of customers and applications. We\u2019ve been in the Applications Cloud business for longer than we\u2019ve been in the infrastructure cloud business. We\u2019re extremely strong in healthcare, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Providence Saint Joseph, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente, National Health Service in the UK, long list of providers, that\u2019s a partial list, are using Oracle ERP, supply chain and HCM applications. But it\u2019s not just the clinical providers that are using our systems, the payers, the healthcare payers. So again, as we tackle healthcare with -- in conjunction with our Cerner acquisition, we\u2019re not just automating providers, we\u2019re also automating payers. We\u2019re also automating pharmaceutical companies as they do clinical trials. We\u2019re trying, to automate the entire ecosystem, not just a fraction of it. So I mentioned a list of providers and payers, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, Highmark Health, Health Care Service Corporations, Independence Blue Cross, Bright Health, so payers as well as providers. We\u2019re extremely strong in that. I mean, we -- again, I\u2019ll just leave it with extremely strong. Healthcare wins in the quarter in Q2, Cigna, a huge payer win; Emirates Health Services, big provider where we beat SAP; Cross Country Health Services where we beat Workday and SAP. Henry Schein is a provider of healthcare products for -- and there -- we won there. But again, it is the entire healthcare infrastructure that we are focusing on as we try to automate healthcare systems around the world. Go-lives, go-lives in the quarter, Tenet Health, 65 hospitals, 235,000 employees, they went live on HR payroll and recruiting. Cleveland Clinic, is going live. I know it\u2019s called Cleveland Clinic, but they also -- they own hospitals all over the place. They\u2019ve gone live in a bunch of regional hospitals in Florida. University of Chicago Medical Center has gone live. Baptist Health Care has gone live, 12 hospitals with 26,000 employees. Lakeview Center has gone live in the quarter. So, we\u2019re just getting stronger and stronger in health care. And so, let me move on to financial services, our other -- another industry that we deem very, very strategic and key to Oracle\u2019s future is financial services, specifically banking. And we\u2019re very, very strong there, Bank of -- in terms of ERP, HCM, supply chain, our customers include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Vanguard, Santander, TD Bank in Canada, HSBC in the UK, UBS, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, Sumitomo Mitsui. It\u2019s a partial list. We are extremely strong in the banking sector. And what you\u2019re going to see in Oracle ERP with our strength in the banking sector is we will be offering loan origination for B2B commerce. One of the things we\u2019re doing with the new version of Oracle ERP is if you\u2019re a customer that\u2019s buying something and you have Oracle ERP, and we -- and you are a company that\u2019s selling something and you have Oracle ERP, the way that B2B transaction will occur, it will be entirely automated within the cloud. So you\u2019ll submit a purchase order, the buying ERP system will submit a purchase order to the selling ERP system. And if you need to borrow money, we will originate a loan with one of our banking partners. If the product has to be shipped, we will schedule the shipping and track the shipment with one of our logistic partners. And our ambition here is to completely automate B2B commerce between buying and selling companies that are running Oracle Cloud ERP and manage all of the financing and insurance and logistics associated with that transaction. We do a really good job, I think, of automating B2C transactions. Amazon does that extremely well. Walmart does that extremely well. But we don\u2019t do a great job of automating B2B transactions. And that\u2019s what Oracle\u2019s ambition is to do that. And we\u2019re in a great position because we are so strong in cloud ERP. So, it\u2019s an Oracle system that\u2019s -- an Oracle procurement system on one end of that transaction. It\u2019s an Oracle order management system on the other end of that transaction. We have very strong partners in finance, insurance and logistics so we can completely automate the entire transaction, where B2B transactions begin to look like B2C transactions. They\u2019re fully end-to-end automated. And that\u2019s a huge new business for us and our partners. Okay. Let\u2019s see. Financial Services wins in the quarter. We\u2019ve added M&T Bank, TD Bank, Daiwa Securities -- Farmers Insurance. Nexi, which is where we replaced SAP at Nexi, it\u2019s an Italian bank. We replaced SAP at TD Bank. Let\u2019s see what else. Financial services go lives. AmTrust, BlackRock, a big go live. They are -- they have $10 trillion of managed assets. Oracle now has 9 of the top 10 asset management firms, running on the Oracle Cloud ERP. FirstRand Bank, a bunch of other banks. I don\u2019t want to take up all the time. So, I\u2019m going to stop there. We have a lot more data on our website that will tell you -- that will enumerate still more customers that we acquired in this very strong second quarter and that went live in the second quarter. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Bo, if you could prepare the audience for Q&A. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results. Larry, Oracle has a rich history of being a price performance leader in just about everything it does. But technically speaking, why exactly does OCI have an inherent cost advantage? And how sustainable is that advantage? Thanks.\nLarry Ellison: Well, maybe the most interesting thing is we have a much faster network than anybody else. We have a fundamentally different network than any of the other cloud providers. We have what\u2019s called an RDMA network that we had to build because our Exadata machines and our database -- actually glued together a lot of computers. And when you had a single database application, that could run on one computer or it could run on a cluster of computers, the 2 computers, 4 computers, 8 computers, whatever, so that there was no single point of failure. One of the beauties of the Oracle database, one of the big differences between the Oracle database and other databases is that the Oracle database, a single application could run on multiple computers. If one of those computers would fail, the application would keep running. It was fall tolerant. It would tolerate a failure of a machine. Other people don\u2019t have that. But in order to do that, we had to make our network, if we\u2019re going to have a cluster of 4 machines running a single database app, we have to make that network between those 4 machines very fast. And that\u2019s called an RDMA network. It means that one computer can immediately access the memory of another computer without going through an interrupt. It\u2019s a very fast way to interconnect computers and have them act as a group. We built that for our entire cloud, so we can run our database, our Oracle real application cluster database on any of the computers in our cloud. Now because we\u2019ve built this hyper-fast network, it turns out it has more utility than just running the Oracle database. So, if you\u2019re running a cluster of computers doing a simulation, a car crash simulation, that was one of the first applications people noticed, ran much faster on Oracle. Now, a much bigger application they noticed ran much faster on Oracle was on neural networks and machine learning workloads run much faster on Oracle. So, because our network is just intrinsically much faster and -- by the way, also there are security and reliability advantages to go along with that. So, our network configured. We actually have -- all of our computers actually have two networks. I\u2019m not going to go into all the details. But our computers are fundamentally different than any other cloud company. We have two networks, one of which is on the Internet -- I\u2019d say, one of which interconnects all of our customers\u2019 computers. And the other, which is our -- if you will, our control network where our -- and computers that run our cloud control software, which is isolated from the customer software. So, the customer can\u2019t tamper with our cloud control software. They can\u2019t get control of it. And we can\u2019t see the customers\u2019 data. That is unique to Oracle. But the -- because we have the two networks and because one of the networks is RDMA, we just run much, much faster, much more reliably than they do. And it\u2019s a fundamental advantage that they can\u2019t compete with unless they rebuild their cloud from scratch.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take that question now from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse.\nPhil Winslow: Congrats on another strong quarter. And really two metrics jumped out to me this quarter. First was IaaS revenue accelerated at 59% from 58% and 39% in the prior two quarters. And organic ERP growth also accelerated to 28%, which is pretty phenomenal this quarter from 22% and 17% in the prior two quarters. Can you just give us sort of a breakdown of what\u2019s driving this continued strength compared to some of your cloud competitors in the past in IaaS world that have experienced decelerating growth in recent months? Are there any workloads in particular that are driving the relative strength of OCI?\nSafra Catz: I don\u2019t know, Larry, if you want to take it or I take it\nLarry Ellison: You can take it. I mean the workloads, I\u2019ll just say on the workloads. AI and machine learning is a huge -- is exploding NVIDIA. NVIDIA, the people who provide the GPUs for most AI workloads are -- they\u2019re moving a huge amount of stuff to the Oracle Cloud and a bunch of other companies that are doing that. But that\u2019s one new one. I mean, obviously, database, but I\u2019ll let that question really go onto Safra.\nSafra Catz: Well, it\u2019s really across the board, to be fair. We\u2019ve got high-performance computing. We\u2019ve got most of the auto companies doing their simulations on us. And then, we have Oracle workloads, autonomous database and other workloads. We have extremely broad, just extremely broad moves. I think I told you in previous quarters that, of course, our growth rates are higher because we\u2019re smaller, but yet as we grow, we\u2019re actually accelerating because of exactly the features that Larry covered in the last question, customers are coming to us, often not expecting the phenomenal results. And remember, time is money on the cloud. So, if you\u2019re more performant, it is much less expensive, whether it\u2019s Oracle workloads or straight compute or storage or other workloads. The other thing is you have to understand that our cloud of customers, our national security regions, all of those are being contracted, and we are clearly the choice for governments to maintain their sovereignty over their data. We can land a center very quickly, and they have -- and they fill up very quickly. So, we really have it coming from all areas. And then, of course, our applications business, Larry basically said it. I mean, we\u2019re in it. And we\u2019re winning consistently deal after deal, both as our e-business suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards customers moved to us but also SAP installations choosing us over what they had before. So, it\u2019s just on all fronts, frankly.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Well, it\u2019s awesome to see everything that you\u2019ve been talking about the past couple of years playing out. So keep up a great work.\nOperator: We go next now to John DeFucci of Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Larry, to the answer to the first question, that\u2019s actually something we\u2019ve been thinking about. That\u2019s going to help as we dig in to better understand the benefits of OCI. But it\u2019s amazing to hear the core differentiation of RAC continues to drive differentiation even 20 years later. My question is actually for Safra. Safra, you mentioned your flexible business model in your prepared remarks and which is unique. BYOL, you were a pioneer in doing that. And license was surprisingly strong again. Can you talk in a little more detail about what\u2019s really driving that license strength?\nSafra Catz: So contrary to, I think, the fears the people always have, the Oracle database is still the biggest part of license by far. So most important part, the database remains strong because customers understand that they can BYOL, bring your own license, and they can have coverage whether they\u2019re on-premise in the cloud or moving in between the two, so again, really always the big number. But we\u2019ve got growth rates that are very strong in analytics. We have growth rates that are super strong in Java, we have growth rates that are strong in the industry\u2019s areas, some of our industry\u2019s applications. And then -- so I want to make sure I gave you the numbers both ways. With Cerner, we have a growth rate of 23% because, of course, you add the Cerner license. Without Cerner, it\u2019s 9% growth. So, even without Cerner, we have license growth after a very strong growth rate a full year ago in license. So, again, big dog is, of course, technology. That\u2019s the bulk of it. But we\u2019ve got a few industry apps and a little bit of Cerner. And it just remains just super strong.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay. That makes sense. It sounds like a lot of things are working together here. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nSafra Catz: Absolutely.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go next now to Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking question. I really appreciate the ability to ask the question, and congratulations on the quarter. Two related questions on Cerner. Safra, where are we on the Cerna integration process as well as taking out the cost? And where do you think you can drive those long-term costs over time. And Larry, we heard a lot of great features at Oracle World about Cerner and what you going to do in healthcare. It\u2019d be interesting to hear what progress you\u2019ve made recently. Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Sure. So Mark, we\u2019ve owned Cerner for about five months. And I will tell you that they continue to do better than we had projected internally. So, we\u2019re very, very happy. But we are still at the beginning. We don\u2019t want to do anything that will damage the business. And of course, we\u2019re very, very focused on those customers. But we are already having some level of savings. But ultimately, just so that you understand, our expectation is we will run them at typical Oracle margins. So, we\u2019ve got quite a way to go. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you\u2019ll see continued improvement as we\u2019ve done some of our operational integration. And simultaneously, I think they continue to over perform for us. So, we are doing this in a very careful way. So, it\u2019s not to put any issues for our customers and making sure they\u2019re successful. On the technical side, Larry, that\u2019s for you.\nLarry Ellison: Yes. Well, actually, on the technical side, of course, what we\u2019re trying to do is build -- not just provider systems. In other words, what Cerner did primarily in competition with EPIC is the automated hospitals. And yes, we want to automate hospitals and clinics and doctors\u2019 offices and do that. We certainly want to automate providers. But we\u2019re layering on top of that is we want to do national public health. We are doing national public health systems. I mentioned Oxford Nanopore that\u2019s an early warning system to detect the next pathogen that could lead to a pandemic. These global public health systems need to be built. And we are in discussions. We are in discussions with not companies, but countries about building and deploying a global early warning system so we can detect the next pathogen that threatens to turn into a pandemic, we can catch it early enough that we can prevent it from being a pandemic. God forbid, if there is another pandemic that we have up to the minute, up to the second data about how that country\u2019s infrastructure is managing the hospitalization rates and vaccination rates and all of those things, so we can better deploy and manage our resources during a pandemic. So, we don\u2019t have a repeat of the things that went on during COVID-19. So, I expect -- Safra just gone back from visiting some prospective customers that are countries that we will be signing contracts with a number of countries to build these national systems. And these contracts are enormous, I mean, absolutely enormous. And there will be several of them. So, as I said in my note in the press release, the scale of this healthcare opportunity is unprecedented but so are the responsibilities that go along with it. We have to -- we, as humanity has to do a better job of delivering healthcare to people than we have done historically. And we can never have a repeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. And I think there is this worldwide sense of urgency and national consciousness about getting a new generation of systems out there that help us at first prevent and then manage our healthcare -- prevent a pandemic and better manager healthcare systems. As far as I know, Oracle is the only company in the world that\u2019s trying to address this issue. And we\u2019re about to sign up a number of countries that will work with us on doing just that.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our final question this afternoon from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. One quick question. If you think about the global environment, usually, it\u2019s not the time to look at or in the olden days, I remember when I was at PwC, it wasn\u2019t the time to kind of look at your back office systems, but you\u2019re kind of growing really nicely. NetSuite is actually kind of outgoing now Fusion a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers and what you\u2019re seeing out there? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Yes. Let me start that, and Larry can add if you want. So I want to remind you that we are global, right, which includes whether we\u2019re in Europe and in the United States, but we\u2019re also in the Gulf states and really in Asia, different parts, Latin America. And there are always companies that get to the point where their business, they cannot afford to keep using their older systems. They spend too much using them. They spend too much running them. And they are actually holding them back, and they know that. And I think one of the things many companies learned during COVID was those companies that did not get on some sort of a track to get a digital connection with their customers, employees and suppliers that were at a huge disadvantage. And so that momentum continues. And it is possible that any individual country or location there could be some little slowdown here or there. And yet there are other countries and industries that are doing incredibly well and they view this as critical. When customers move to SaaS they end up spending less but also have much better capabilities to sell more to work with their employees and their suppliers, and of course, as I said, their customers. So that momentum has started, has started, and it just continues very, very strongly. And again, we are global. So, even when there are some issues in some regions, we\u2019re in other regions that are doing phenomenally well right now.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bo to close the call.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Mr. Bond. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Oracle\u2019s Q2 2023 earnings conference call. Again, we\u2019d like to thank you so much for joining us and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, simply put, we had an outstanding quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was more than $200 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 25% in constant currency. Even excluding Cerner, total revenue grew 9% in constant currency that's higher than Q1 and on top of a revenue beat this time last year. The strength of the quarter is even more amazing, given that the currency headwind was higher than what it was when I gave guidance with 6% for revenue and a $0.095 headwind for earnings per share. And yet, we still exceeded the high end of my USD guidance for both, total revenue and earnings per share. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to experience clear company-specific and product-specific momentum. The reasons are many, but it boils down to a few key points of differentiation. First, more and more customers are recognizing our second-generation infrastructure cloud as being fundamentally better architected for higher performance, better security and unmatched reliability versus the older first-generation hyperscale cloud providers. Second, customers appreciate the flexibility of our service and business model that enables them to deploy our technologies where it serves them best, whether that be in the public cloud, in dedicated regions around the world or in a true clouded customer implementation. And third, customers recognize the value of an end-to-end integrated stack of applications, both horizontal, like ERP and HCM and supply chain, and industry-specific applications that focus on their industries. And all of it is on our Gen 2 infrastructure, which is designed perfectly for them as they move through. As customers increasingly look to better value out of their technology investments, many discover that Oracle is much better compared to other alternatives. Gartner formerly recognized OCI by moving us to Visionary status in its cloud infrastructure and platform services report for the first time. In addition, last week, we were awarded a JWCC award at the U.S. Department of Defense as they also recognized our capabilities. As all of these differentiators come together and our business continues to accelerate, we expect organic growth for our fiscal year 2023 cloud revenues will be over 30% in constant currency. Now to the numbers. As always, I'll discuss our results using constant currency growth rate. To provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the revenue results excluding Cerner, so you can see what's going on. Total cloud revenue, now that's SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.8 billion, up 48% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, $1.1 billion, up 59% and SaaS revenue of $2.8 billion, up 45%. Now, excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS was up 27% in constant currency at $3.3 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.6 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and, of course, our Generation 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.1 billion, up 35% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.3 billion, up 9% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.2 billion and was up 16%. Now, our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.9 billion and grew 26% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 59% in constant currency. Now excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 69% with an annualized revenue of $3.8 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 88% and cloud and customer consumption revenue, up 83% and autonomous database up 50%. Software license revenues, including Cerner, were $1.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency and up 9% without Cerner. What is increasingly resonating with customers is that in an environment where IT investments need to have a fast and tangible return on investment, only Oracle offers customers the flexibility to manage their technology estate, so they can deploy incremental investments where it brings them the most immediate value. It also helps that the purchase of technology licenses from Oracle enables them to move to the cloud as they are ready, effectively providing an on-ramp to Oracle Cloud services. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.3 billion, up 25% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up over 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing total revenue growth to be negatively affected by over 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 65% of the total number of cloud services and license support revenue. Now, it's down to 53%, and this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support. By the way, license support grew 4% this year. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved again this quarter, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve in response to accelerating demand we have continued to build data center capacity. We have seen that as those centers fill up, margins go up like they did this quarter. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6%, excluding Cerner in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin, including Cerner, was 41% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle levels and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. Further, I expect that this year, will be the trough year for operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4. I think I guided to 20.5. So basically, it worked out where we thought. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, down 1% in USD, up 7% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.63. At quarter end, we had nearly $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.7 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.1 billion and free cash flow was $8.4 billion with capital expenditures of $6.7 billion. In addition, we now have 40 public cloud regions around the world with another 9 being built. In addition, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We also have many cloud customer implementations, dedicated regions in another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more as customers want to have their data protected in their country. We are careful to pace our investments appropriately, but need to continue to build to meet our accelerating demand. CapEx this quarter was $2.4 billion as we continued to invest in our cloud to meet this accelerating demand. With triple-digit IaaS bookings growth the last couple of quarters we now expect to spend about this amount per quarter for the next few quarters as we build capacity for our customers' needs. This level of spend though will not negatively impact our operating margins as we scale. When I talk about accelerating demand, that demand is reflected in the remaining performance obligation or RPO balance, which is now at $61.2 billion, up 68% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as to Cerner. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate in constant currency accelerated to 28% in Q2, up from 22% last quarter and approximately 48% of the total RPO is to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Now, as we've said before, I know you're tired of me saying it, but I will, we are continuing -- we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for a total of $448 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as there is strong demand for our cloud services. So now, let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Using currency exchange rates as they are right now, currency should have a 4% negative effect on total revenue and at least a $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q3. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end, but we've got to use a number, so we're using the number right now. Total revenues for Q3, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and 43% to 47% in USD. I expect the total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency. Again, due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $1.17 and $1.21 in USD. And as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q3. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19% last year. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. I don't know, Larry, if you want to take it or I take it Well, it's really across the board, to be fair. We've got high-performance computing. We've got most of the auto companies doing their simulations on us. And then, we have Oracle workloads, autonomous database and other workloads. We have extremely broad, just extremely broad moves. I think I told you in previous quarters that, of course, our growth rates are higher because we're smaller, but yet as we grow, we're actually accelerating because of exactly the features that Larry covered in the last question, customers are coming to us, often not expecting the phenomenal results. And remember, time is money on the cloud. So, if you're more performant, it is much less expensive, whether it's Oracle workloads or straight compute or storage or other workloads. The other thing is you have to understand that our cloud of customers, our national security regions, all of those are being contracted, and we are clearly the choice for governments to maintain their sovereignty over their data. We can land a center very quickly, and they have -- and they fill up very quickly. So, we really have it coming from all areas. And then, of course, our applications business, Larry basically said it. I mean, we're in it. And we're winning consistently deal after deal, both as our e-business suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards customers moved to us but also SAP installations choosing us over what they had before. So, it's just on all fronts, frankly. So contrary to, I think, the fears the people always have, the Oracle database is still the biggest part of license by far. So most important part, the database remains strong because customers understand that they can BYOL, bring your own license, and they can have coverage whether they're on-premise in the cloud or moving in between the two, so again, really always the big number. But we've got growth rates that are very strong in analytics. We have growth rates that are super strong in Java, we have growth rates that are strong in the industry's areas, some of our industry's applications. And then -- so I want to make sure I gave you the numbers both ways. With Cerner, we have a growth rate of 23% because, of course, you add the Cerner license. Without Cerner, it's 9% growth. So, even without Cerner, we have license growth after a very strong growth rate a full year ago in license. So, again, big dog is, of course, technology. That's the bulk of it. But we've got a few industry apps and a little bit of Cerner. And it just remains just super strong. Absolutely. Sure. So Mark, we've owned Cerner for about five months. And I will tell you that they continue to do better than we had projected internally. So, we're very, very happy. But we are still at the beginning. We don't want to do anything that will damage the business. And of course, we're very, very focused on those customers. But we are already having some level of savings. But ultimately, just so that you understand, our expectation is we will run them at typical Oracle margins. So, we've got quite a way to go. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you'll see continued improvement as we've done some of our operational integration. And simultaneously, I think they continue to over perform for us. So, we are doing this in a very careful way. So, it's not to put any issues for our customers and making sure they're successful. On the technical side, Larry, that's for you. Yes. Let me start that, and Larry can add if you want. So I want to remind you that we are global, right, which includes whether we're in Europe and in the United States, but we're also in the Gulf states and really in Asia, different parts, Latin America. And there are always companies that get to the point where their business, they cannot afford to keep using their older systems. They spend too much using them. They spend too much running them. And they are actually holding them back, and they know that. And I think one of the things many companies learned during COVID was those companies that did not get on some sort of a track to get a digital connection with their customers, employees and suppliers that were at a huge disadvantage. And so that momentum continues. And it is possible that any individual country or location there could be some little slowdown here or there. And yet there are other countries and industries that are doing incredibly well and they view this as critical. When customers move to SaaS they end up spending less but also have much better capabilities to sell more to work with their employees and their suppliers, and of course, as I said, their customers. So that momentum has started, has started, and it just continues very, very strongly. And again, we are global. So, even when there are some issues in some regions, we're in other regions that are doing phenomenally well right now."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Okay. I'm going to go over -- primarily, I'm going to go over customers and new wins in infrastructure and then customers and wins and go-lives in applications. But I'm going to start with infrastructure. So, during Q2, we signed multiple customers to contracts exceeding $1 billion, infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 billion. Let me be clear, multiple customers signed contracts for $1 billion worth of infrastructure. So, given -- that's been added to our backlog, we expect our infrastructure business to continue to grow very, very strongly into the future. We now have 22,000 infrastructure customers. We have a total of 55 regions. That's public regions plus national security regions and the other kinds of regions and that's more than AWS or Microsoft or anybody, which may surprise some people. Gartner, as Safra mentioned, moved us into the Visionary Quadrant for the first time. So, let me just start naming specific customers and give you a flavor. I'm going to name large customers, small customers. I'm going to focus a little bit on a bunch of international customers to let you know that our investment in data centers all over the world is really paying off. So, our customers include -- big customers include, FedEx, Deutsche Bank, Tokyo Stock Exchange. Let me take a moment to emphasize Tokyo Stock Exchange. We're the only ones running a major stock exchange. And this is -- Tokyo is not the only one because our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable. It doesn't go down. In fact, my favorite quote from a big phone company in the United States was the difference between Oracle's Cloud and the other clouds are simply that Oracle Cloud doesn't go down. I think that's a very important issue when you have enterprise applications like a stock exchange where you can't ever go down. Fujitsu is another big customer; Vodafone that's phone company has similar problems. If you're a phone company, the phone system can't go down. Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Enbridge; Kaiser, a huge health care company in the -- primarily in the United States. NVIDIA has moved and a bunch of others have moved, lots of AI, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads to the Oracle Cloud because it turns out we're really good at that. We're better than that than any of the other clouds, which may surprise some people. Schneider Electric, Telecom Italia, Verizon and lots, lots more. I'm not just going to list them all. We publish a big list at oracle.com and every quarter, we add new customers to that. So, in the quarter, we added United Airlines -- database wins in the quarter, United Airlines, migrating all flight operations to the Oracle Exadata cloud. Albertsons, again, moving to the Exadata cloud service database. Mitsui in Japan, again, moving their databases to Oracle. Again, this is the beginning of a very major, very large business for us as our database franchise moves primarily from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. Persol Career, a big professional services company in Japan, migrating to -- or moving their Oracle databases to the cloud. Unimed, LAD Healthcare, once again moving their databases to the Oracle Cloud. Penske Truck Leasing, doing using -- moving to autonomous database. HomeServe plc in the UK, government agency is moving the autonomous transaction processing system. So, they're not just moving an existing Oracle database to the cloud, they're upgrading from our on-premise Oracle database to our autonomous database, which is only available in the cloud. Iberia Express, a big telco, same thing moving to autonomous data warehouse. They just -- the idea is the autonomous data warehouse makes database administration very simple. In fact, it's entirely automated. There is no database administration. Delgado [ph] Auto Taxi, again, in APAC, a smaller company, again, moving their databases to autonomous system. MaxiTRANS, big transportation company in Australia, same thing, autonomous transaction processing. The Scroll, [ph] a big Japanese wholesale company, autonomous -- moving to autonomous database. Banco Safra, this is -- by the way, this is not -- our CEO does not own a bank. This is not an internal -- she didn't not buy our database. But there's a big bank in Latin America called Banco Safra and they're moving all their mission-critical apps to OCI, as is Bradesco, same thing. Yorkshire Building Society in the UK, again, autonomous data warehouse. And Nestle\u0301, a food giant in EMEA is moving their analytics systems to autonomous data warehouse and that's a huge customer. Okay. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we have a new version of our MySQL open source database, and we added a new ultrafast query processor called HeatWave to MySQL and that's doing extremely well. We have a number of companies doing that migration. Medallia, Infonow [ph] Credit Club. It's a long list of people that are moving to MySQL to take advantage of the fact that our query processor in our version of MySQL is 100 times faster. I really mean that. And we have all the benchmarks. We publish all the benchmarks, and we publish the source code of the benchmarks, so you can duplicate those results, 100 times faster than queries than the Amazon equivalent called Aurora; Aurora, Amazon's version of MySQL. As Safra mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft Azure is going extremely well. We have a number of companies running applications in Azure. And then Azure is connected to OCI, so the database is in OCI and the application is in Azure. The Belgium Railways is one. Honeywell in the United States, Petronas [ph] the big energy and utility company, Telecom Italia Mobile A [ph], but that multi-cloud system is doing extremely well. And we think that is the future of cloud. We think the future of cloud is not 4-walled gardens, AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle. We think those clouds are all going to interconnect. And then customers will pick the most appropriate service for their particular needs and mix and match between the clouds. Okay. A lot more -- a major city in the southwest, which I'm not allowed to mention is literally migrating everything to OCI. Lambda, which is a big AI machine learning specialist company is moving the bulk of their workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs and our fast -- our very, very fast network to interconnect them. And this is a pattern. Lambda is doing that, Latent Space is doing that. NVIDIA themselves are doing that. So we're seeing a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads moving from other clouds to OCI because we're faster. And again, in the cloud business faster -- when you charge by the minute, faster means cheaper. Give me 1 second. Alexa, be quite. Sorry about that. I think Jeff Bezos did that. Okay. So, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, National Institute of Health. These are all new cloud customers, new infrastructure cloud customers -- again from very large to medium-sized companies are moving to OCI and lots of them. Twist Biosciences is moving healthcare -- again, AI workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs. AIA Life Insurance Company, a big financial services company, again, is moving to OCI and databases to OCI. In India, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, a giant utility, is moving all of their metering and billing applications to OCI. Win Win [ph] Intelligent Information Technology is moving their IoT platform from AWS to OCI, and they're also using MySQL HeatWave. Algar Telecom, Brazilian Stock Exchange, Claro, again, big media telco, moving to OCI; Ncell. Unimed Curitiba, a large health care company in Latin America moving to OCI; Vivo, again, moving to OCI. Banco de Chile, E-Banks [ph] another financial services company; Rabobank. DP World, the transportation and logistics company in the Middle East, Austin TranSit Partnership, a municipality in Texas they're perfect -- an interesting customer because they've been using Oracle ERP and EPM and our applications for a long time. Now they're moving their infrastructure to OCI. Oman Telecommunications. A huge French telecommunication company, I'm not allowed to mention. They're moving to OCI. Oxford Nanopore, a big -- a gene sequencing company is moving from AWS to OCI where they are going to store gene sequencing, but not only just store gene sequences in OCI, they also do analytics to figure out if -- what they've sequenced is a new version of COVID-19 or another pathogen, if the pathogen they've never seen before, extremely important application for world health. Reed Exhibitions, Saudi Ministry of Media, Ecobank, financial services in EMEA, GlobeMed Limited, Morrisons, a big retail operation, again, all moving to on OCI. HDFC Bank and Waafi Bank, I'm going to stop there, but we published a long list, but there's tremendous momentum, tremendous momentum and a large number of customers from all over the world, very large and medium-sized companies moving to OCI, and the business is growing very strongly, as Safra pointed out in the numbers. Okay. In the back -- in applications, I'll try to do this quickly. We're just winning in the back office. We have 22,000 customers in infrastructure and the cloud. We have 11,000 Fusion ERP and HCM customers alone in applications, just Fusion customers. We have 11,000 now. We have probably close to 30,000, 30,000 NetSuite customers on top of that. So, we have a lot of customers and applications. We've been in the Applications Cloud business for longer than we've been in the infrastructure cloud business. We're extremely strong in healthcare, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Providence Saint Joseph, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente, National Health Service in the UK, long list of providers, that's a partial list, are using Oracle ERP, supply chain and HCM applications. But it's not just the clinical providers that are using our systems, the payers, the healthcare payers. So again, as we tackle healthcare with -- in conjunction with our Cerner acquisition, we're not just automating providers, we're also automating payers. We're also automating pharmaceutical companies as they do clinical trials. We're trying, to automate the entire ecosystem, not just a fraction of it. So I mentioned a list of providers and payers, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, Highmark Health, Health Care Service Corporations, Independence Blue Cross, Bright Health, so payers as well as providers. We're extremely strong in that. I mean, we -- again, I'll just leave it with extremely strong. Healthcare wins in the quarter in Q2, Cigna, a huge payer win; Emirates Health Services, big provider where we beat SAP; Cross Country Health Services where we beat Workday and SAP. Henry Schein is a provider of healthcare products for -- and there -- we won there. But again, it is the entire healthcare infrastructure that we are focusing on as we try to automate healthcare systems around the world. Go-lives, go-lives in the quarter, Tenet Health, 65 hospitals, 235,000 employees, they went live on HR payroll and recruiting. Cleveland Clinic, is going live. I know it's called Cleveland Clinic, but they also -- they own hospitals all over the place. They've gone live in a bunch of regional hospitals in Florida. University of Chicago Medical Center has gone live. Baptist Health Care has gone live, 12 hospitals with 26,000 employees. Lakeview Center has gone live in the quarter. So, we're just getting stronger and stronger in health care. And so, let me move on to financial services, our other -- another industry that we deem very, very strategic and key to Oracle's future is financial services, specifically banking. And we're very, very strong there, Bank of -- in terms of ERP, HCM, supply chain, our customers include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Vanguard, Santander, TD Bank in Canada, HSBC in the UK, UBS, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, Sumitomo Mitsui. It's a partial list. We are extremely strong in the banking sector. And what you're going to see in Oracle ERP with our strength in the banking sector is we will be offering loan origination for B2B commerce. One of the things we're doing with the new version of Oracle ERP is if you're a customer that's buying something and you have Oracle ERP, and we -- and you are a company that's selling something and you have Oracle ERP, the way that B2B transaction will occur, it will be entirely automated within the cloud. So you'll submit a purchase order, the buying ERP system will submit a purchase order to the selling ERP system. And if you need to borrow money, we will originate a loan with one of our banking partners. If the product has to be shipped, we will schedule the shipping and track the shipment with one of our logistic partners. And our ambition here is to completely automate B2B commerce between buying and selling companies that are running Oracle Cloud ERP and manage all of the financing and insurance and logistics associated with that transaction. We do a really good job, I think, of automating B2C transactions. Amazon does that extremely well. Walmart does that extremely well. But we don't do a great job of automating B2B transactions. And that's what Oracle's ambition is to do that. And we're in a great position because we are so strong in cloud ERP. So, it's an Oracle system that's -- an Oracle procurement system on one end of that transaction. It's an Oracle order management system on the other end of that transaction. We have very strong partners in finance, insurance and logistics so we can completely automate the entire transaction, where B2B transactions begin to look like B2C transactions. They're fully end-to-end automated. And that's a huge new business for us and our partners. Okay. Let's see. Financial Services wins in the quarter. We've added M&T Bank, TD Bank, Daiwa Securities -- Farmers Insurance. Nexi, which is where we replaced SAP at Nexi, it's an Italian bank. We replaced SAP at TD Bank. Let's see what else. Financial services go lives. AmTrust, BlackRock, a big go live. They are -- they have $10 trillion of managed assets. Oracle now has 9 of the top 10 asset management firms, running on the Oracle Cloud ERP. FirstRand Bank, a bunch of other banks. I don't want to take up all the time. So, I'm going to stop there. We have a lot more data on our website that will tell you -- that will enumerate still more customers that we acquired in this very strong second quarter and that went live in the second quarter. With that, I'm going to turn it back over to Safra. Well, maybe the most interesting thing is we have a much faster network than anybody else. We have a fundamentally different network than any of the other cloud providers. We have what's called an RDMA network that we had to build because our Exadata machines and our database -- actually glued together a lot of computers. And when you had a single database application, that could run on one computer or it could run on a cluster of computers, the 2 computers, 4 computers, 8 computers, whatever, so that there was no single point of failure. One of the beauties of the Oracle database, one of the big differences between the Oracle database and other databases is that the Oracle database, a single application could run on multiple computers. If one of those computers would fail, the application would keep running. It was fall tolerant. It would tolerate a failure of a machine. Other people don't have that. But in order to do that, we had to make our network, if we're going to have a cluster of 4 machines running a single database app, we have to make that network between those 4 machines very fast. And that's called an RDMA network. It means that one computer can immediately access the memory of another computer without going through an interrupt. It's a very fast way to interconnect computers and have them act as a group. We built that for our entire cloud, so we can run our database, our Oracle real application cluster database on any of the computers in our cloud. Now because we've built this hyper-fast network, it turns out it has more utility than just running the Oracle database. So, if you're running a cluster of computers doing a simulation, a car crash simulation, that was one of the first applications people noticed, ran much faster on Oracle. Now, a much bigger application they noticed ran much faster on Oracle was on neural networks and machine learning workloads run much faster on Oracle. So, because our network is just intrinsically much faster and -- by the way, also there are security and reliability advantages to go along with that. So, our network configured. We actually have -- all of our computers actually have two networks. I'm not going to go into all the details. But our computers are fundamentally different than any other cloud company. We have two networks, one of which is on the Internet -- I'd say, one of which interconnects all of our customers' computers. And the other, which is our -- if you will, our control network where our -- and computers that run our cloud control software, which is isolated from the customer software. So, the customer can't tamper with our cloud control software. They can't get control of it. And we can't see the customers' data. That is unique to Oracle. But the -- because we have the two networks and because one of the networks is RDMA, we just run much, much faster, much more reliably than they do. And it's a fundamental advantage that they can't compete with unless they rebuild their cloud from scratch. You can take it. I mean the workloads, I'll just say on the workloads. AI and machine learning is a huge -- is exploding NVIDIA. NVIDIA, the people who provide the GPUs for most AI workloads are -- they're moving a huge amount of stuff to the Oracle Cloud and a bunch of other companies that are doing that. But that's one new one. I mean, obviously, database, but I'll let that question really go onto Safra. Yes. Well, actually, on the technical side, of course, what we're trying to do is build -- not just provider systems. In other words, what Cerner did primarily in competition with EPIC is the automated hospitals. And yes, we want to automate hospitals and clinics and doctors' offices and do that. We certainly want to automate providers. But we're layering on top of that is we want to do national public health. We are doing national public health systems. I mentioned Oxford Nanopore that's an early warning system to detect the next pathogen that could lead to a pandemic. These global public health systems need to be built. And we are in discussions. We are in discussions with not companies, but countries about building and deploying a global early warning system so we can detect the next pathogen that threatens to turn into a pandemic, we can catch it early enough that we can prevent it from being a pandemic. God forbid, if there is another pandemic that we have up to the minute, up to the second data about how that country's infrastructure is managing the hospitalization rates and vaccination rates and all of those things, so we can better deploy and manage our resources during a pandemic. So, we don't have a repeat of the things that went on during COVID-19. So, I expect -- Safra just gone back from visiting some prospective customers that are countries that we will be signing contracts with a number of countries to build these national systems. And these contracts are enormous, I mean, absolutely enormous. And there will be several of them. So, as I said in my note in the press release, the scale of this healthcare opportunity is unprecedented but so are the responsibilities that go along with it. We have to -- we, as humanity has to do a better job of delivering healthcare to people than we have done historically. And we can never have a repeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. And I think there is this worldwide sense of urgency and national consciousness about getting a new generation of systems out there that help us at first prevent and then manage our healthcare -- prevent a pandemic and better manager healthcare systems. As far as I know, Oracle is the only company in the world that's trying to address this issue. And we're about to sign up a number of countries that will work with us on doing just that."

We had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing 23% in constant currency and beating the high-end of our guidance. We also had a great organic quarter with total revenue growing 8% in constant currency. This was on top of a fantastic Q4 last quarter. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to get excellent returns on the investments we've been making over the last few years in products, infrastructure and our sales organization. We are seeing company-specific and product-specific momentum. We continue to expect organic revenue growth and our cloud business will accelerate substantially in FY '23. The currency headwind this quarter was much higher than the 3% headwind that was present when we gave guidance. It was actually 6 points, even though due to rounding, it may look like 5%. And that's a currency headwind to total revenue, it was in fact 6 points. And yet we still exceeded our forecasts on a reported basis and we beat our constant currency revenue forecast by $200 million. We saw similar currency headwinds in EPS which had an $0.08 negative effect much worse than the $0.05 headwind present at the time of guidance in June. It's because of the significant and volatile swings in currencies, that I always discuss our results using constant currency growth rate, and so that you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now to the numbers and there's a lot here. I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the results, excluding Cerner, which many of you are focused on. I hope you're pleased with our expanded disclosure this year. So total cloud revenue that\u2019s SaaS and IaaS including Cerner, was $3.6 billion, up 45% in USD and up 50% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, a smidge under $900 million and SaaS revenue at $2.7 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 20% in constant currency driven again by fusion autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support were $4 billion, up 37% in constant currency. Again, Q1 cloud application revenue that\u2019s SaaS was $2.7 billion, up 43% in USD, up 48% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, including support were $4.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. And to be clear, that's actually 7% organic growth with no contribution from Cerner. Q1 cloud infrastructure or IaaS revenue was $0.9 billion, up 52% in USD, up 58% in constant currency, again, with no contribution from Cerner. Now, the revenue results, excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue that's IaaS plus SaaS, excluding Cerner was up 29% in constant currency at $3.1 billion. Organic revenue growth for both IaaS and SaaS was significantly higher than last quarter. Application subscription revenues, excluding Cerner were up 12% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $5.8 billion and grew 33% in constant currency, including fusion ERP, which was up 38%. NetSuite ERP up 30% and Fusion HCM up 26%. That means that SaaS revenues, excluding Cerner were $2.2 billion, up 20%. Infrastructure cloud service revenue was up 58% in constant currency. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 70% with an annualized revenue of $3.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 92%, and Autonomous Database, which was up 56%. And it's not only that our growth rates are higher than our hyperscale competitors, maybe you'd expect that because we're the newest and thus the smallest, but our growth rates are increasing as we get bigger. Our second generation cloud launched after our competitors first generation cloud, and so we've been able to architect it more performantly, more securely and more sustainably. As a result, as more companies test our cloud, they discover how much better it is on price, security, performance and sustainability. In addition, we now have cloud regions in more countries and cities than AWS and Azure, giving our customers more choices for their sovereign data. And finally, many of our customers appreciate how flexible our service and business model is. All of this is amazing our customers, and I can't wait to share the stage with some of them at Oracle CloudWorld in October. Now, to license revenues, including Cerner, were $904 million, up 19% in constant currency led by database options and Java. Total database revenues were up 3% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency, excluding Cerner revenue of $1.4 billion, organic revenue was up 8% in constant currency. In addition, I want to point out that since we no longer operate in Russia, this negatively affected revenue by over 1 point of growth. Had we still, had we not left, actually, our growth rate would be over 9% this quarter. Operating expenses were up 34%, mainly due to adding in Cerner's expenses, and the mix of our business. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 81% and the associated gross profit dollars grew 15% with Cerner and 7% excluding Cerner. In fact, the gross margin percentage on IaaS increased dramatically in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.5 billion, up 10% from last year. And I expect that we'll see strong operating income growth again in Q2. The operating margin, including Cerner was 39%, which is lower than in the past, since we only just began to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner and its profitability to Oracle standards, and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow margin dollars, but also grow margin percentages significantly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, slightly above the guidance rate and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, unchanged in USD and up 8% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.56, down 34% and down 26% in constant currency, that's our GAAP EPS. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $10.5 billion and free cash flow was $5.4 billion with capital expenditures of $5.2 billion. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $6.4 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. At quarter end, we had $11.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the short-term, deferred revenue balance was $10.5 billion, up 11% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $16.7 billion, up 62% in constant currency due to strong bookings as well as the addition of Cerner. However, I would note for you all that the organic RPO growth accelerated to 22% in Q1 from 17% in Q4, approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and our dividend. This quarter we repurchased 7.5 million shares for a total of 559 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS, while substantially increasing cloud revenue. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as their strong demand for our cloud services. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I will provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now we are assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. That's not a prediction, that's just giving it to you as a translation as it currently is. In that case, currency should have a 5% to 6% negative effect on total revenue, and at least a $0.07 negative effect on EPs in Q2. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 20.5, which is up from 19.2 last year. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. So now to guidance. Total revenues for Q2, including Cerner are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency, and are expected to grow from 15% to 17% in USD. Total cloud growth, again including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency, 42% to 46% in USD. I expect that total cloud growth for the fiscal year excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency, again due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to decline 1% to 5% and be between $1.16 and $1.20 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q2. And with that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle announced that we had built a high speed interconnect between Microsoft Azure Cloud and the Oracle Cloud. The purpose of this Multi-cloud interconnect is to enable Azure customers to directly use the very latest Oracle Database technology, even if their application is running in Azure. In other words, customers can now use any combination of Microsoft and Oracle Cloud services together as if they were in one cloud. That was last quarter. This quarter, Oracle is making the latest version of our mice MySQL HeatWave database available in Amazon's AWS cloud. Multiple published customer benchmarks have shown that MySQL HeatWave delivers 7x better performance than Amazon Redshift. 10x better performance than Snowflake and up to 10x higher throughput than Amazon's own MySQL database called Aurora. The Multi-cloud era has begun. Customers are already buying applications and cloud infrastructure from several different providers, including Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Oracle and others. Our job is to give our customers the ability to choose application and infrastructure technology from multiple clouds and then have those different clouds coexist and interoperate gracefully. Multi-cloud interoperability is an important step in the evolution of cloud computing. Multi-cloud interoperability is one of the reasons our infrastructure business is booming, growing over 50% in U.S dollars, and almost 60% in constant dollars. We expect Oracle's total cloud business to exceed a $20 billion annual run rate next year. Now I'll highlight some of our big new infrastructure wins in Q1. Overall, we added about 1,000 new paying customers for infrastructure in Q1. Let's start off with NVIDIA. NVIDIA chose OCI to build their SaaS products for data scientists for machine learning and inferencing along with moving their entire health care platform called Clara to OCI. Mosaic has developed a state-of-the-art neural network on OCI, and they picked OCI because OCI outperformed all of the other clouds when running machine learning and AI. The Avis car rental company is moving their entire Oracle estate, along with their Oracle applications to OCI. The Chicago public schools are closing data centers and migrating their Oracle estate to the Oracle Cloud. Tanium, a leader in cybersecurity chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help safeguard their customers with industry-leading security. OCI deployment will be a part of its multi-cloud strategy and delivering its SaaS platform Tanium as a service. Cigna, a health care company is migrating their existing Exadata on-premise to the Oracle Cloud. Additionally, their SaaS ERP system is being integrated with Oracle Cloud Digital Assistant. Tennessee and Oklahoma are both new government cloud customers. This was the first group of customers were all from North America. I just finished my list beginning with NVIDIA and North America and Tennessee and Oklahoma in North America. I'm now going to move to wins in LAD. AT&T in Mexico is the first case of any telco to move their entire Amdocs stack to a cloud and they're moving it their Amdocs stack to OCI's New Mexico cloud region. Avianca, one of the largest airlines in Latin America will move all of their workloads to OCI. Entel, another telecom, in fact, the largest telecom in Chile is now moving all of their critical workloads from AWS to OCI. Banco Digimais, a fintech bank in Brazil is moving their entire on-premises VMware estate to run in OCI 100%. Serasa Experian, a financial services company is moving AI training for OCR biometrics and facial recognition to OCI. Bionexo, another infotech company -- in the health care business, serving 1,500 -- 15,000 hospitals and clinics is migrating their data lake and their data warehouses from Amazon Web Services to OCI. Santander, a large bank is moving all of their databases from mainframes and Oracle databases all to the Oracle Exadata Cloud Service. Unimed, also a health care, a company health care insurance company is beginning the migration of all of their applications and database to OCI. Sky Mexico, the largest satellite paid TV producer in Mexico will move all of their data lakes and all of their data warehouses to OCI in the New Mexico region. That's Latin America. In JPAC, and maybe this is the most interesting customer I'll talk about, NRI, Nomura Research, is continuously expanding their dedicated cloud region. In Japan, they've just added a second data center NRI has. The Oracle Cloud in Japan, the NRI Oracle Cloud in Japan already runs 50% of all transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That's a mission critical application. ICI [ph] Bank Financial Services is the new customer in JPAC, Japan, Asia Pacific. Hitachi construction in Japan is moving their manufacturing, their critical manufacturing systems to OCI. [Indiscernible] timing technology, an infotech company is the new customer in Asia Pacific. Daiichi Sankyo is the first big pharma in Japan that is moving their database -- their Oracle Database workloads to the cloud. Pacific International Lines, the big transportation company is the new customer in Asia Pac. Li & Fung, a trading company, another new customer, we had -- again, eventually, we had a 1,000 new customers this quarter in OCI. [Indiscernible] another fintech company is again another big new customer for us in Asia Pacific. H2O Retailing is moving their entire VMware on-premise VMware estate to OCI. They're one of the largest retailers in Japan. Again, Asian Development Bank is the new customer in Asia Pac. [Indiscernible] Vision is an infotech company new customer. We have, again, a bunch of new customers in OCI all over the world. That's JPAC. Now let me move to EMEA. Dojo, a financial services company chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for their payment platform because their benchmark showed that the Oracle Cloud OCI is more secure and has better availability than the competition. Al Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Islamic Bank is in the process of moving all of its applications and databases to the Oracle Cloud. Unilever is integrating a few -- their Oracle Fusion Applications with the autonomous database to build a next generation super secure, super agile platform for Unilever. Atlantic Financial Group, an infotech company, hosts core banking functions on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which to many of their banking customers. Centrico [ph], an infotech company is moving all their workloads from their old data centers to a combination of OCI using OCI's multi-cloud services to access other clouds. Mio [ph], big telephone company moving over 300 Oracle Databases to the Oracle Exadata cloud. [Indiscernible], the government agency migrating all databases off their IBM mainframes and UNIX systems to the Oracle Database and to the Oracle Cloud. And I'll close with the U.K Home Office, the department is moving to the Oracle Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure with a focus on dramatically improving both security and reliability. With that, I will turn it back over to Safra.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Josh, if you could go ahead and queue up the audience for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Hi, Safra and, Larry. A little surprised to see your strong results here when most software companies, other than some of the pure security names really faltered some against the macro backdrop. And frankly, you just didn't hear. But I want to focus the question on one area that we've gotten the most questions on since we launched coverage, and that's on organic constant currency cloud services growth. It looks like you came in above the high-end of your guidance for the quarter and you reiterated Safra that you expect greater than 30% growth for the year, which doesn't seem like a stretch like it did when you gave that first. We understand the way a subscription model works, but we obviously don't see everything that you see. Can you give us some more color around what's driving the results this quarter and what gave you the confidence in this outlook for cloud services. Was it previously contracted revenue that's just starting to ramp up with an expected increase in consumption or something else or all the above?\nSafra Catz: So let me tell you, it is all of the above. But let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications, or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen2 OCI or to Fusion, for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen2 cloud is so much better than what they're used to, and is so much more flexible, and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs. But they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is. So what happens is, they may start small, and then they accelerate in their consumption. And they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts. As you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. But we have, as I said so much company-specific or product specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure and how differently we\u2019re architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. And so it's just incredible company-specific, product specific momentum. And nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here. And whether they're trying to save cost or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost competitively for them.\nLarry Ellison: Yes, let me just add one sentence to that. We are the only infrastructure company that builds enterprise scale applications. As a result of building these enterprise scale applications, we have made our infrastructure much, much better. So we not only provide infrastructure and sell infrastructure, we consume the infrastructure ourselves. I think that gives us certain insights as to what we need to build at the infrastructure layer to make our application secure, reliable and so on. And easy to use and make people productive. That's why -- I think that's why what customers are discovering when they come to our cloud, that they're more productive, the system runs faster, it's more secure, it's easier to use, all of that. And that's what gives us confidence that we can build the next generation of health care applications, because we do both. We do both applications, enterprise applications and infrastructure. And we're the only one.\nJohn DiFucci: So it sounds like that the expansion within your customer base of cloud services is becoming or has become more predictable. And that makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, John. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nPhilip Winslow: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another strong quarter of organic growth. Now obviously Oracle has been delivering accelerating growth in its infrastructure and database businesses for multiple quarters now. Safra, can you give us some more color on just what the drivers are behind this and how sustainable they are, be it BYOL, database add-ons, Autonomous Database, et cetera. And then a question for Larry. Obviously, the expanded partnership with Azure announced in July received pretty universal positive feedback. And you just announced today that Oracle's MySQL HeatWave will be available on AWS. How do you think about these multi-cloud partnerships impacting the already positive existing momentum in your database business going forward?\nSafra Catz: Larry, why don't you go first, and then I'll fill in if you've missed any. Yes.\nLarry Ellison: Okay, boss, I will do that. Again, multi-cloud -- I think one of the issues I know a lot of people for years have been concerned about can Oracle sustain its leading market share in the database business? And I think what is clear is if our databases are available in multiple clouds, I think then the answer is clearly yes. If our database is not available in multiple clouds, then it's an interesting question whether we can and maintain it just in our own cloud. We've decided to make our best and greatest technology available in multiple clouds. And that gives customers choice, they can use it in OCI. They can use MySQL HeatWave at AWS. They have choices, but they will be able to choose between, let's say, Amazon's Aurora or Oracle's MySQL HeatWave. They will be able to choose between Snowflake or the Oracle Autonomous Database. And I think as long as we're available in multiple clouds, we're going to be very strong, very, very -- and very, very competitive against these other companies and these other technologies.\nSafra Catz: And the answering for you on how is the Oracle database doing? Well, you saw we had an amazing Q4. And in Q1, again, the Oracle database is what people choose if they have real work to do. It's very secure. It's very performant and they know it has so many capabilities that you don't have to have 16 different databases to get a complicated job done. You can do everything with it in different ways. And the database options are continued to be acquired. Many more customers still want enterprise agreements, so they can BYOL, bring your own license to the Oracle Cloud. Our technology remains unbelievably strong with Java. And so the business overall, our tech business remains incredibly strong, even though it's enormous. And for many, many of the reasons I think there was a period a few years back, where folks were thinking they would try lots of other things and things that were maybe more \" fashionable\". I think they've realized that actually getting your job done securely, performantly, sustainably, and also really least expensive is to actually use our products to do that. And so they've been doubling down and committing and bringing those workloads to the Oracle Cloud again, propelling just incredible momentum, whether it's Cloud@Customer, dedicated regions or our public cloud.\nKen Bond: Thanks, Phil. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. Larry, Safra, historically, in increasingly difficult economic conditions, organizations focused on what drove revenue growth or immediate savings and thus products like Salesforce automation, with similarities received funding while back office projects were delayed. What is different this time, both from a ERP point of view and an HCM point of view? What's going to drive the sustained growth and strength that you're expecting in Oracle strategic back office? Thank you.\nSafra Catz: Sure. So let me start by since I'm also the Principal Financial Officer, if I would say that in another company, I'd be the one making the decision to buy fusion ERP, and Fusion HCM. And what is absolutely clear, is that saving money in the back office is basically automatic when you use our products, when you move from, from especially from our competitors products, which are so expensive to maintain and run. When you move to fusion, you can save so much in your back office, that you can use that money to invest in things that help you extend the differentiation of your business. Now, today's the 12 of September. In fact, I signed off with our auditors on Friday, but we don't do our earnings on Friday. So we had to wait all the way till Monday. Now no other companies report on the 9th or the 8th. In fact, most companies were reporting their July quarter on last week. And here we are announcing an August quarter. Well, what does that have to do with costs? Well, I can tell you that when you are in a position to know your results, and to announce them, and to file your earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you've not only saved time, you've saved millions in process dollars, and in the way you run your business. And I just want to point out that we were able to do this after acquiring in the quarter, Cerner by putting their data from their old system into Fusion and consolidating it in fusion. So we actually believe that one of the most important ways to drive business transformation is to move to a much more streamlined cloud product than running old back office systems.\nLarry Ellison: Let me just add one thing. I\u2019m sorry, let me add one thing, which is Safra addressed the issue of using modernizing back office to save money. Let me tell you another way, you can save money we -- I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS. And the AWS bill is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. And we expect next quarter, we'll be announcing some brands and companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you.\nMark Moerdler: I'll stop there. Amazing.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler: Great. Thanks. And I'll echo my congratulations. And Larry, thanks for all the color on the OCI wins. I was hoping to get an update on your go-to-market strategy for OCI when it's clearly becoming a more critical growth driver for you guys. Is there a dedicated Salesforce? Are you doing more bundling of OCI with other offerings? Just hoping to get an update on how you're going to market and what kind of resources you're putting around us?\nLarry Ellison: Yes, because with 58% growth, it certainly seems like you're now gaining share in the cloud infrastructure market. It's a big market to go after. So any color on that would be helpful.\nSafra Catz: Let me start, Larry. Absolutely.\nLarry Ellison: Okay, so. \u2026\nSafra Catz: So, one of the enormous changes we made in the past year, year or so euro2 is that we've invested in a lot more engineering talent in the field to help our customers bring over workloads. And once we've shown them how to do it, and the enormous benefit they get by doing it. This is the Ultimate Sales accelerator, because there's nothing like the customer who realizes that our solution is just so much better and so much less expensive for them. And you have to do that often, by let's say, priming the pump by sending engineers, field engineers who can help the customers move those workloads and that's really propelled what's been going on in our OCI Cloud. Larry, you go ahead.\nLarry Ellison: Yes, I think exactly what Safra said, and I'll add what I just repeat what I said earlier. The amount of money, these huge companies, these very famous companies spend with Amazon is kind of staggering. I mean, everyone assumes, hey, I move to the cloud, and I'd save a lot of money. It depends which cloud you move to. And Oracle is much less expensive than the competition. One, partially because we're faster, which time is money when you're when you're paying by the hour. So again, I'm going to repeat, we're talking to the most famous brands that are running at Amazon, and some of them are going to be moving very soon.\nMark Moerdler: Exciting. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thanks, Derrick. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you, and congrats on the solid execution. Larry, we've heard of some very exciting things happening with Cerner pretty quickly after the deal just closed with some hospital networks, we heard from significantly expanding their existing contracts. Can you talk about the unique value you're able to deliver now that Cerner is a part of Oracle and the broader expansion opportunity that you see ahead. And if I could just sneak in one for you as well, Safra $1.7 billion in CapEx and q1 is a pretty big number. And I know very well that you don't spend frivolously What can you tell us about the big step up here?\nLarry Ellison: Okay, I'll go first, let's have a bug with 1.7 CapEx is there's just so much demand. Safra mentioned we have more data centers in more countries and in more cities than either Amazon, or AWS. And we're expanding because the demand is there. We expect to be growing in the 50% range for cloud services. And that means we're going to be -- we are going to be half to -- half to be adding a lot of data center capacity and opening a lot of new data centers and we're doing that. The fact that we're running in Oracle Cloud data centers running half of Tokyo Stock Exchange, as the other cloud vendors, how many stock exchanges they run. The -- our stuff is very secure, it's very reliable, it's very performance, it's very, very cost effective. And therefore we have huge opportunity, therefore, we're spending the money to expand. We have a huge opportunity for growth, and we're not going to miss it. But we're still going to be as you know, Safra is very cautious. We're very, we're always very cautious. We pay a lot of attention to profitability. But we also have to pay attention to the top line, as well as the bottom line and take advantage of this growth opportunity. And I think there was a second part of the question that [indiscernible].\nBrad Zelnick: Cerner, he asked you all about Cerner. Cerner. a big other part. Yes, one of the things I think that we don't really talk about, but I alluded to the fact that we both build applications, and we run them with on our infrastructure. The tools we use for building applications, our latest generation of tools, are the autonomous database very different than from all the Oracle databases or any other database that came before. There are no DBAs. There is no human labor associated with running the Oracle Database anymore. So there can be no human error. The costs are so much cheaper. Our own internal cloud, our own cloud OCI, uses autonomous database to run all the control systems, because claim [indiscernible] doesn't want to hire a lot of DBAs to lower costs. Also, he doesn't want any errors of commission. It's much more reliable than when you have human beings driving the car. We use that for the next generation of Cerner, the Oracle Autonomous database. We pair that with an all new application development tool called Apex [ph], which is a low code tool. So our newest applications, our very newest applications that we were built, we are building, we're building any autonomous database with Apex, which allows us to do stuff that would have taken three or four years in less than a year. So we expect to have our first pretty complete new Cerner health management product out within 12 months, which I think is going to, again, it's something we never could have done with the previous generation of databases or the previous generation of application development tools. But all of that has changed. We have these phenomenal low code tools. I mean, one of the things about the low code tool is you almost -- you don't have to do security audits because security is built into the tool. You can't build an insecure applications using Apex [Indiscernible] tolerance is built into the tool, if the application should fail, it's a stateless application. So it immediately failover into another data center in a millisecond and keep running, no one will even know about the failure. So our new generation of application development tools is going to enable us to modernize the server -- the Cerner technology at a rate that would be inconceivable a couple of years ago.\nBrad Zelnick: Amazing. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Brad. That does appear to be our last question. So a telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Josh for closing.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing 23% in constant currency and beating the high-end of our guidance. We also had a great organic quarter with total revenue growing 8% in constant currency. This was on top of a fantastic Q4 last quarter. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to get excellent returns on the investments we've been making over the last few years in products, infrastructure and our sales organization. We are seeing company-specific and product-specific momentum. We continue to expect organic revenue growth and our cloud business will accelerate substantially in FY '23. The currency headwind this quarter was much higher than the 3% headwind that was present when we gave guidance. It was actually 6 points, even though due to rounding, it may look like 5%. And that's a currency headwind to total revenue, it was in fact 6 points. And yet we still exceeded our forecasts on a reported basis and we beat our constant currency revenue forecast by $200 million. We saw similar currency headwinds in EPS which had an $0.08 negative effect much worse than the $0.05 headwind present at the time of guidance in June. It's because of the significant and volatile swings in currencies, that I always discuss our results using constant currency growth rate, and so that you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now to the numbers and there's a lot here. I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the results, excluding Cerner, which many of you are focused on. I hope you're pleased with our expanded disclosure this year. So total cloud revenue that's SaaS and IaaS including Cerner, was $3.6 billion, up 45% in USD and up 50% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, a smidge under $900 million and SaaS revenue at $2.7 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 20% in constant currency driven again by fusion autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support were $4 billion, up 37% in constant currency. Again, Q1 cloud application revenue that's SaaS was $2.7 billion, up 43% in USD, up 48% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, including support were $4.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. And to be clear, that's actually 7% organic growth with no contribution from Cerner. Q1 cloud infrastructure or IaaS revenue was $0.9 billion, up 52% in USD, up 58% in constant currency, again, with no contribution from Cerner. Now, the revenue results, excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue that's IaaS plus SaaS, excluding Cerner was up 29% in constant currency at $3.1 billion. Organic revenue growth for both IaaS and SaaS was significantly higher than last quarter. Application subscription revenues, excluding Cerner were up 12% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $5.8 billion and grew 33% in constant currency, including fusion ERP, which was up 38%. NetSuite ERP up 30% and Fusion HCM up 26%. That means that SaaS revenues, excluding Cerner were $2.2 billion, up 20%. Infrastructure cloud service revenue was up 58% in constant currency. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 70% with an annualized revenue of $3.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 92%, and Autonomous Database, which was up 56%. And it's not only that our growth rates are higher than our hyperscale competitors, maybe you'd expect that because we're the newest and thus the smallest, but our growth rates are increasing as we get bigger. Our second generation cloud launched after our competitors first generation cloud, and so we've been able to architect it more performantly, more securely and more sustainably. As a result, as more companies test our cloud, they discover how much better it is on price, security, performance and sustainability. In addition, we now have cloud regions in more countries and cities than AWS and Azure, giving our customers more choices for their sovereign data. And finally, many of our customers appreciate how flexible our service and business model is. All of this is amazing our customers, and I can't wait to share the stage with some of them at Oracle CloudWorld in October. Now, to license revenues, including Cerner, were $904 million, up 19% in constant currency led by database options and Java. Total database revenues were up 3% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency, excluding Cerner revenue of $1.4 billion, organic revenue was up 8% in constant currency. In addition, I want to point out that since we no longer operate in Russia, this negatively affected revenue by over 1 point of growth. Had we still, had we not left, actually, our growth rate would be over 9% this quarter. Operating expenses were up 34%, mainly due to adding in Cerner's expenses, and the mix of our business. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 81% and the associated gross profit dollars grew 15% with Cerner and 7% excluding Cerner. In fact, the gross margin percentage on IaaS increased dramatically in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.5 billion, up 10% from last year. And I expect that we'll see strong operating income growth again in Q2. The operating margin, including Cerner was 39%, which is lower than in the past, since we only just began to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner and its profitability to Oracle standards, and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow margin dollars, but also grow margin percentages significantly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, slightly above the guidance rate and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, unchanged in USD and up 8% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.56, down 34% and down 26% in constant currency, that's our GAAP EPS. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $10.5 billion and free cash flow was $5.4 billion with capital expenditures of $5.2 billion. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $6.4 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. At quarter end, we had $11.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the short-term, deferred revenue balance was $10.5 billion, up 11% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $16.7 billion, up 62% in constant currency due to strong bookings as well as the addition of Cerner. However, I would note for you all that the organic RPO growth accelerated to 22% in Q1 from 17% in Q4, approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and our dividend. This quarter we repurchased 7.5 million shares for a total of 559 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS, while substantially increasing cloud revenue. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as their strong demand for our cloud services. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I will provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now we are assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. That's not a prediction, that's just giving it to you as a translation as it currently is. In that case, currency should have a 5% to 6% negative effect on total revenue, and at least a $0.07 negative effect on EPs in Q2. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 20.5, which is up from 19.2 last year. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. So now to guidance. Total revenues for Q2, including Cerner are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency, and are expected to grow from 15% to 17% in USD. Total cloud growth, again including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency, 42% to 46% in USD. I expect that total cloud growth for the fiscal year excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency, again due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to decline 1% to 5% and be between $1.16 and $1.20 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q2. And with that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments. So let me tell you, it is all of the above. But let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications, or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen2 OCI or to Fusion, for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen2 cloud is so much better than what they're used to, and is so much more flexible, and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs. But they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is. So what happens is, they may start small, and then they accelerate in their consumption. And they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts. As you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. But we have, as I said so much company-specific or product specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure and how differently we're architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. And so it's just incredible company-specific, product specific momentum. And nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here. And whether they're trying to save cost or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost competitively for them. Larry, why don't you go first, and then I'll fill in if you've missed any. Yes. And the answering for you on how is the Oracle database doing? Well, you saw we had an amazing Q4. And in Q1, again, the Oracle database is what people choose if they have real work to do. It's very secure. It's very performant and they know it has so many capabilities that you don't have to have 16 different databases to get a complicated job done. You can do everything with it in different ways. And the database options are continued to be acquired. Many more customers still want enterprise agreements, so they can BYOL, bring your own license to the Oracle Cloud. Our technology remains unbelievably strong with Java. And so the business overall, our tech business remains incredibly strong, even though it's enormous. And for many, many of the reasons I think there was a period a few years back, where folks were thinking they would try lots of other things and things that were maybe more \" fashionable\". I think they've realized that actually getting your job done securely, performantly, sustainably, and also really least expensive is to actually use our products to do that. And so they've been doubling down and committing and bringing those workloads to the Oracle Cloud again, propelling just incredible momentum, whether it's Cloud@Customer, dedicated regions or our public cloud. Sure. So let me start by since I'm also the Principal Financial Officer, if I would say that in another company, I'd be the one making the decision to buy fusion ERP, and Fusion HCM. And what is absolutely clear, is that saving money in the back office is basically automatic when you use our products, when you move from, from especially from our competitors products, which are so expensive to maintain and run. When you move to fusion, you can save so much in your back office, that you can use that money to invest in things that help you extend the differentiation of your business. Now, today's the 12 of September. In fact, I signed off with our auditors on Friday, but we don't do our earnings on Friday. So we had to wait all the way till Monday. Now no other companies report on the 9th or the 8th. In fact, most companies were reporting their July quarter on last week. And here we are announcing an August quarter. Well, what does that have to do with costs? Well, I can tell you that when you are in a position to know your results, and to announce them, and to file your earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you've not only saved time, you've saved millions in process dollars, and in the way you run your business. And I just want to point out that we were able to do this after acquiring in the quarter, Cerner by putting their data from their old system into Fusion and consolidating it in fusion. So we actually believe that one of the most important ways to drive business transformation is to move to a much more streamlined cloud product than running old back office systems. Let me start, Larry. Absolutely. So, one of the enormous changes we made in the past year, year or so euro2 is that we've invested in a lot more engineering talent in the field to help our customers bring over workloads. And once we've shown them how to do it, and the enormous benefit they get by doing it. This is the Ultimate Sales accelerator, because there's nothing like the customer who realizes that our solution is just so much better and so much less expensive for them. And you have to do that often, by let's say, priming the pump by sending engineers, field engineers who can help the customers move those workloads and that's really propelled what's been going on in our OCI Cloud. Larry, you go ahead."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle announced that we had built a high speed interconnect between Microsoft Azure Cloud and the Oracle Cloud. The purpose of this Multi-cloud interconnect is to enable Azure customers to directly use the very latest Oracle Database technology, even if their application is running in Azure. In other words, customers can now use any combination of Microsoft and Oracle Cloud services together as if they were in one cloud. That was last quarter. This quarter, Oracle is making the latest version of our mice MySQL HeatWave database available in Amazon's AWS cloud. Multiple published customer benchmarks have shown that MySQL HeatWave delivers 7x better performance than Amazon Redshift. 10x better performance than Snowflake and up to 10x higher throughput than Amazon's own MySQL database called Aurora. The Multi-cloud era has begun. Customers are already buying applications and cloud infrastructure from several different providers, including Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Oracle and others. Our job is to give our customers the ability to choose application and infrastructure technology from multiple clouds and then have those different clouds coexist and interoperate gracefully. Multi-cloud interoperability is an important step in the evolution of cloud computing. Multi-cloud interoperability is one of the reasons our infrastructure business is booming, growing over 50% in U.S dollars, and almost 60% in constant dollars. We expect Oracle's total cloud business to exceed a $20 billion annual run rate next year. Now I'll highlight some of our big new infrastructure wins in Q1. Overall, we added about 1,000 new paying customers for infrastructure in Q1. Let's start off with NVIDIA. NVIDIA chose OCI to build their SaaS products for data scientists for machine learning and inferencing along with moving their entire health care platform called Clara to OCI. Mosaic has developed a state-of-the-art neural network on OCI, and they picked OCI because OCI outperformed all of the other clouds when running machine learning and AI. The Avis car rental company is moving their entire Oracle estate, along with their Oracle applications to OCI. The Chicago public schools are closing data centers and migrating their Oracle estate to the Oracle Cloud. Tanium, a leader in cybersecurity chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help safeguard their customers with industry-leading security. OCI deployment will be a part of its multi-cloud strategy and delivering its SaaS platform Tanium as a service. Cigna, a health care company is migrating their existing Exadata on-premise to the Oracle Cloud. Additionally, their SaaS ERP system is being integrated with Oracle Cloud Digital Assistant. Tennessee and Oklahoma are both new government cloud customers. This was the first group of customers were all from North America. I just finished my list beginning with NVIDIA and North America and Tennessee and Oklahoma in North America. I'm now going to move to wins in LAD. AT&T in Mexico is the first case of any telco to move their entire Amdocs stack to a cloud and they're moving it their Amdocs stack to OCI's New Mexico cloud region. Avianca, one of the largest airlines in Latin America will move all of their workloads to OCI. Entel, another telecom, in fact, the largest telecom in Chile is now moving all of their critical workloads from AWS to OCI. Banco Digimais, a fintech bank in Brazil is moving their entire on-premises VMware estate to run in OCI 100%. Serasa Experian, a financial services company is moving AI training for OCR biometrics and facial recognition to OCI. Bionexo, another infotech company -- in the health care business, serving 1,500 -- 15,000 hospitals and clinics is migrating their data lake and their data warehouses from Amazon Web Services to OCI. Santander, a large bank is moving all of their databases from mainframes and Oracle databases all to the Oracle Exadata Cloud Service. Unimed, also a health care, a company health care insurance company is beginning the migration of all of their applications and database to OCI. Sky Mexico, the largest satellite paid TV producer in Mexico will move all of their data lakes and all of their data warehouses to OCI in the New Mexico region. That's Latin America. In JPAC, and maybe this is the most interesting customer I'll talk about, NRI, Nomura Research, is continuously expanding their dedicated cloud region. In Japan, they've just added a second data center NRI has. The Oracle Cloud in Japan, the NRI Oracle Cloud in Japan already runs 50% of all transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That's a mission critical application. ICI [ph] Bank Financial Services is the new customer in JPAC, Japan, Asia Pacific. Hitachi construction in Japan is moving their manufacturing, their critical manufacturing systems to OCI. [Indiscernible] timing technology, an infotech company is the new customer in Asia Pacific. Daiichi Sankyo is the first big pharma in Japan that is moving their database -- their Oracle Database workloads to the cloud. Pacific International Lines, the big transportation company is the new customer in Asia Pac. Li & Fung, a trading company, another new customer, we had -- again, eventually, we had a 1,000 new customers this quarter in OCI. [Indiscernible] another fintech company is again another big new customer for us in Asia Pacific. H2O Retailing is moving their entire VMware on-premise VMware estate to OCI. They're one of the largest retailers in Japan. Again, Asian Development Bank is the new customer in Asia Pac. [Indiscernible] Vision is an infotech company new customer. We have, again, a bunch of new customers in OCI all over the world. That's JPAC. Now let me move to EMEA. Dojo, a financial services company chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for their payment platform because their benchmark showed that the Oracle Cloud OCI is more secure and has better availability than the competition. Al Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Islamic Bank is in the process of moving all of its applications and databases to the Oracle Cloud. Unilever is integrating a few -- their Oracle Fusion Applications with the autonomous database to build a next generation super secure, super agile platform for Unilever. Atlantic Financial Group, an infotech company, hosts core banking functions on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which to many of their banking customers. Centrico [ph], an infotech company is moving all their workloads from their old data centers to a combination of OCI using OCI's multi-cloud services to access other clouds. Mio [ph], big telephone company moving over 300 Oracle Databases to the Oracle Exadata cloud. [Indiscernible], the government agency migrating all databases off their IBM mainframes and UNIX systems to the Oracle Database and to the Oracle Cloud. And I'll close with the U.K Home Office, the department is moving to the Oracle Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure with a focus on dramatically improving both security and reliability. With that, I will turn it back over to Safra. Yes, let me just add one sentence to that. We are the only infrastructure company that builds enterprise scale applications. As a result of building these enterprise scale applications, we have made our infrastructure much, much better. So we not only provide infrastructure and sell infrastructure, we consume the infrastructure ourselves. I think that gives us certain insights as to what we need to build at the infrastructure layer to make our application secure, reliable and so on. And easy to use and make people productive. That's why -- I think that's why what customers are discovering when they come to our cloud, that they're more productive, the system runs faster, it's more secure, it's easier to use, all of that. And that's what gives us confidence that we can build the next generation of health care applications, because we do both. We do both applications, enterprise applications and infrastructure. And we're the only one. Okay, boss, I will do that. Again, multi-cloud -- I think one of the issues I know a lot of people for years have been concerned about can Oracle sustain its leading market share in the database business? And I think what is clear is if our databases are available in multiple clouds, I think then the answer is clearly yes. If our database is not available in multiple clouds, then it's an interesting question whether we can and maintain it just in our own cloud. We've decided to make our best and greatest technology available in multiple clouds. And that gives customers choice, they can use it in OCI. They can use MySQL HeatWave at AWS. They have choices, but they will be able to choose between, let's say, Amazon's Aurora or Oracle's MySQL HeatWave. They will be able to choose between Snowflake or the Oracle Autonomous Database. And I think as long as we're available in multiple clouds, we're going to be very strong, very, very -- and very, very competitive against these other companies and these other technologies. Let me just add one thing. I'm sorry, let me add one thing, which is Safra addressed the issue of using modernizing back office to save money. Let me tell you another way, you can save money we -- I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS. And the AWS bill is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. And we expect next quarter, we'll be announcing some brands and companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you. Yes, because with 58% growth, it certainly seems like you're now gaining share in the cloud infrastructure market. It's a big market to go after. So any color on that would be helpful. Okay, so. ... Yes, I think exactly what Safra said, and I'll add what I just repeat what I said earlier. The amount of money, these huge companies, these very famous companies spend with Amazon is kind of staggering. I mean, everyone assumes, hey, I move to the cloud, and I'd save a lot of money. It depends which cloud you move to. And Oracle is much less expensive than the competition. One, partially because we're faster, which time is money when you're when you're paying by the hour. So again, I'm going to repeat, we're talking to the most famous brands that are running at Amazon, and some of them are going to be moving very soon. Okay, I'll go first, let's have a bug with 1.7 CapEx is there's just so much demand. Safra mentioned we have more data centers in more countries and in more cities than either Amazon, or AWS. And we're expanding because the demand is there. We expect to be growing in the 50% range for cloud services. And that means we're going to be -- we are going to be half to -- half to be adding a lot of data center capacity and opening a lot of new data centers and we're doing that. The fact that we're running in Oracle Cloud data centers running half of Tokyo Stock Exchange, as the other cloud vendors, how many stock exchanges they run. The -- our stuff is very secure, it's very reliable, it's very performance, it's very, very cost effective. And therefore we have huge opportunity, therefore, we're spending the money to expand. We have a huge opportunity for growth, and we're not going to miss it. But we're still going to be as you know, Safra is very cautious. We're very, we're always very cautious. We pay a lot of attention to profitability. But we also have to pay attention to the top line, as well as the bottom line and take advantage of this growth opportunity. And I think there was a second part of the question that [indiscernible]."

Today's call is being recorded, and now I would like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements, in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an absolutely incredible quarter. As you know, Oracle's Q4 is known for customers purchasing large software license contracts to power their businesses. But because of the pivot to the cloud, this Q4 was powered by the enormous demand for our cloud services. And they showed up in RPO or Remaining Performance Obligations. In Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contract in our history, led by huge demand for training large language models, as well as record levels of sales for OCI, autonomous, fusion, and net suite. RPO was $98 billion, up $18 billion from Q3, and up 44% year-over-year from $68 billion last year. And we are trading one-time non-recurring license revenue in return for much bigger strategic customer commitments for multi-year cloud revenue, from which we expect to further accelerate our revenue growth rates. This is exactly what we've been targeting, and it bolsters my confidence that our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance, as well as our growth rates, will only get stronger and accelerate. In short, this Q4 marks the full emergence of our high growth cloud businesses. Now, I started talking about this tipping [0.4] (ph) years ago, and you've seen it continue to play out in our results since then. As a reminder, we accelerated our US dollar revenue growth rate from negative one in fiscal year [2020] (ph) to plus eight this past year if you exclude Cerner. In addition, EPS has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate over that same period. And both operating cash flow and free cash flow, which of course we report on a trailing 12 month basis, were each declining 10% four years ago. This year, they grew 9% and 39% respectively. Now customer conversations are now absolutely fully focused on our cloud services as the results clearly show. So let me give you just a couple of examples -- a few examples. First, as you saw, OpenAI selected Oracle to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle Cloud infrastructure. Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost effective AI infrastructure. In total, we signed over 30 AI contracts for over $12 billion this quarter, and nearly $17 billion this year. Second, we continue to expand our work helping companies use our cloud applications portfolio to reinvent their businesses. As an example, a very large enterprise tech company signed a contract in Q4 for over $600 million where we will be helping them transform their operations with Fusion to enable them to become more agile, faster growing, and more profitable. May I say in the process, we will replace out many of our competitors product. These cross-pillar cloud deals or suite deals, focus on business process reengineering that incorporate multiple cloud applications that no one else can offer. And I want to point out, by the way that today is day 11 of our new fiscal year and we are once again, announcing our results not only for the quarter but the year and giving guidance, making us faster than any other public company by a launch. We are able to do this because of Fusion applications and that is why companies are choosing Fusion and our wonderful teams are showing them the way. And third, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed another multi-cloud partnership this time with Google. OCI and Google Cloud Network interconnect is available immediately in 10 regions, and we will be live with Oracle database at Google Cloud in September, where customers can get direct access to Oracle Database Services running on OCI, deployed in Google Cloud data centers. So what's driving this? Well, it is all about our comprehensive, highly differentiated and secure cloud offering. Customers have progressed from their initial curiosity about Oracle Cloud into full-blown rollout. We have the most secure, complete and cost-effective set of enterprise applications and infrastructure cloud technologies of any vendor. Not only are our cloud technologies vertically integrated to work together, but we offer flexible deployment models like public cloud, multi-cloud, sovereign clubs, dedicated cloud or any other way our customers ask us to deliver. And we also offer Oracle Alloy, where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. Now I'm now going to dive into the details of Q4 and finish my prepared remarks with how this strength and momentum will impact fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Okay. So let's start. In Q4, the dollar strengthened from the time of my Q4 guidance, so we saw a 1% currency headwind to total revenue and a $0.01 currency headwind to EPS. As usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate because this is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue that is SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.7 billion up 23%, including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 20% at $5.3 billion. And SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10% and IaaS revenue of $2 billion, up 42% on top of last year's 77% growth. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.2 billion, up 10%, driven again by our strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database and OCI. Application subscription revenues which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 6%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.7 billion and were up 16%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support were $5.6 billion up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 42%. Excluding legacy hosting, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services grew 44%, with an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 53% were it not for continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscriptions, which includes database license support, were up 6% and highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 26% and now have an annualized revenue of $2 billion. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either to OCI directly or using database at Azure or database at Google Cloud. We expect these cloud database services will be that third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic [SaaS] (ph). Consistent with our strategic direction and reflecting customer preference for cloud services, software license revenues were down 14% and to $1.8 billion. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.3 billion. That's up 4% if you include Cerner, up 5% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. The gross margin percentages for software support and SaaS are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. Gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To that point, though the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 8% in Q4. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year. The operating margin was 47%, up from 44% last year, as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our business. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate came out over 1% higher than my guidance at 20.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.63 and GAAP EPS was $1.11 in USD. As a reminder, the non-GAAP tax rate last year was 9.2%, and this had an adverse effect on this quarter's EPS growth. Non-GAAP pretax income grew 14% in constant currency. So you can figure out that had we had the same tax rate last year as this year, net income would have grown 14% and EPS would have been up 12% in CD, 11% in USD. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $53 billion up 6%. Total cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription-based and accounts for nearly [3/4] (ph) of total revenue was $39.4 billion, up 11%. Total application subscription revenues grew 9% and infrastructure subscription revenue grew 13%. Total cloud services, excluding Cerner, were up 26% to [$17.2 billion] (ph). SaaS revenue, excluding Cerner was up 13% to $10.4 billion for the year. IaaS and cloud infrastructure revenue was up 50% to $6.8 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 66% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $5.56 in USD, up 9% in USD and the full year operating margin percentage was 44%, up from 42% last year. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.3 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 9% and free cash flow was $11.8 billion, up 39%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion. As I mentioned our remaining performance obligations, or RPO is now $98 billion, up 44% in constant currency and the portion excluding Cerner, if you're curious was up 60%. We signed several large deals in this quarter, and we have many more -- many, many more in the pipeline. Approximately 39% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses. Now while we spent $3.5 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $2.8 billion shown in the cash flow statement is lower simply, as a result of timing of payments. We are working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. At this moment, we have 76 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another 19 being built. We have 11 database at Azure sites live and more locations with Microsoft coming online soon. We will have 12 Oracle database at Google Cloud sites live this year. We also have 13 dedicated regions live and 15 more planned. We have several national security regions and EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two alloy cloud regions live with 11 more plant. Of course, we also have many, many, many cloud customer installations as I mentioned earlier, the sizing and flexibility and -- the size and flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredibly advantageous for us in the marketplace. This quarter, we purchased 1.25 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I discuss my guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2025, I do just want you to have a couple of notes. The first is that in Q4, we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2024. Also, I will no longer breaking out the Cerner business in my results. And even though it will begin to grow modestly throughout the year in both revenue and operating margin, it's not necessary to break it out anymore and because it is now operating in a growth mode. Now to guidance. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong cloud demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter as OCI capacity increases to meet demand. We believe our momentum, our current momentum will continue as our pipeline is growing even faster than bookings and our win rates are going higher as well. I expect fiscal year 2025 cloud infrastructure services to grow faster than the 50% we reported this year. CapEx In fiscal year 2025 will probably be double what it is in fiscal year 2024 -- what it was in fiscal year 2024. Okay. Beyond this fiscal year, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal year 2026 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. However, given our strong bookings results, I believe some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. We are going to provide you a more fulsome update on all of this at the Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle Cloud World in Las Vegas in September. Okay. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a negative 1% effect on my revenue and either $0.01 or $0.02 negative on EPS in Q1. However, as you all know, actual currency impact may be more or less, I just can't get that now. Total revenue for Q1 are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and using the currency situation as it is now, they're expected to grow from 5% to 7% in USD. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and 20% to 22% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $1.33 and $1.37 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 10% to 14% and be between $1.31 and $1.35, but this time in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. And as always, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates to vary from my guidance. Okay. I know that was long. But with that, let me turn it to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. I'm going to start by repeating something Safra said. In Q4, Oracle's company-wide RPO increased 44% to $98 billion. In AI alone, we signed contracts with 30 different customers for $12.5 billion in new AI business. These astonishing RPO numbers 44% and $98 billion were driven by massive increases in sales of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI. So who are the companies choosing to use Oracle Cloud Services and Oracle data centers. Well, here are a few names: NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, X AI, Open AI, coherent dozens more. In other words, the world's largest cloud companies and the world's most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle cloud services and data centers. So can -- so why are they working with Oracle, because Oracle's Gen 2 cloud infrastructure is different. OCI's area network moves data much faster. And when you charge by the minute, faster also means less expensive. OCI trains large language models several times faster and at a fraction of the cost of other clouds. OCI\u2019s Critical cloud software, the operating system and the database are fully Autonomous. At OCI, human beings do not run the operating system or the database, Autonomous software robots do. No one else has this level of autonomy in the cloud. Eliminating human labor eliminate human error. Almost all cloud security breaches begin with human error, eliminating the possibility of human error is the only way to make certain your cloud data is not stolen. That's it. The most important technology companies in the world are using OCI because it's faster, less expensive and more secure. Easy to say, not easy to do. Back to you, Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Chris, if you could please poll the audience for questions, we'll begin the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect, thank you. Congrats from me. These are very impressive numbers. Safra, can you try to help us bridge the strong RPO number and how we need to think about feeding that into revenue? Is that just the capacity function? Or is there anything on the customer side that you need to deliver on the technology side you need to deliver. Just help us to bridge the gap on those. Thank you.\nSafra Catz: It's all about capacity. It is -- as we bring the capacity online wherever it's going online around the world is when those workloads are coming over. A lot of the engineering work is done in advance so that those customers know how they can operate. They bring smaller workloads, but the bigger workloads, they are just waiting for us to go online and make it available to them. It is really that level. We are scheduling them on our availability. And as I mentioned, our pipeline to take more deals is all about us just getting the capacity up and live and moving forward.\nRaimo Lenschow: So it's just a mechanical problem in a way.\nSafra Catz: Yes. Well, it's not a problem. It's just the schedule. As things come online, as the data centers go live or as we deliver the computers, they are just getting -- it's just very straightforward. There's no magic here. These customers have done a lot of the analysis in the engineering in advance and have tested us or competed us against our competitors and have chosen us very -- already understanding how we work, and they're just waiting for us to give them more capacity.\nRaimo Lenschow: Great. Very impressive. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you very much and congrats from me as well. Larry, it's great to see the amazing momentum in OCI, especially given it's a competitive market and the leading names in AI are coming to you, wanting to partner with Oracle. Can you talk about the innovation road map for OCI and your AI services in particular? And why we should expect Oracle to keep on winning not just today, but over the next several years to come in this market?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. Well, I think in OCI, we've talked for a while about our ability to build very small data centers, one you could put in a shipper, a submarine or a full cloud, a full Oracle cloud, we will soon have in six standard half racks to go into a conventional data center. So virtually any one of our customers could choose to have the full Oracle Cloud in their data center with every service, every service in the cloud. And they could scale that up quite extraordinarily large. So we talk about the fact that we can start very small and that's a huge difference between us and our competitors. So we can actually put it again customer by customer, small countries, we can do. What we haven't talked so much about is we're also building the largest data centers in the world. We talked about -- I think we talked briefly about one last call, where we can park -- it's a 70-megawatt data center where we can park eight 747s nose to tail in the data center, the huge AI training data center. While we're also building a 200-megawatt data center. In fact, this past quarter, we sold about half of that data center for the -- for a period of time. So we're now bringing 200 megawatt data centers online. So we are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers, all the way up to 200 megawatt data centers ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to-date. This AI race is going to go on for a long time. It's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current. And that's going to take larger and larger data centers. And some of the data centers we have that we're planning are actually even bigger. There -- some are getting very close to our there, say a 1 gigawatt, which is a pretty good-sized city or one enormous AI cloud training data center. No one else can span this range. And in every case, we have unbelievably fast networks that are part of this, the data centers we are building include the power plants and the transmission of the power directly into the data center and liquid cooling. And because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch. And that's what we've been doing for some time. And that's what we'll continue to do. And currently, we are leading the pack and being able to deliver that quality and that scale of data center.\nBrad Zelnick: Amazing, thank you so much Larry.\nOperator: Next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Larry and Safra, it's impressive to see how fast you ramped OCI as you're now available in 11 data centers. And then now with this Google partners, we'll have Oracle database at Google Cloud. So I have two questions: one is, as you embark on offering this multi-cloud flexibility to customer, when can we see a similar partnership with AWS? And second is, how should we think about these partners is helping your customers migrate their on-prem Oracle workloads to cloud?\nSafra Catz: I don't know, Larry you wanted \u2013 started with that.\nLarry Ellison: I guess I can start. Well, we believe in giving customers choice. And customers want choice. Customers are using multiple clouds, not only infrastructure cloud, but they might have sales force applications or Workday applications \u2013 or they use multiple cloud in their business right now. So it's very important, we think that these -- that all the clouds become interconnected. So we're thrilled to have the connection with Microsoft and be building OCI data centers inside of it -- right inside of Azure. So the computers are next to each other to minimize network costs and network latency, which is all good things. We're doing the same thing with Google. We would love to do the same thing with AWS. We think we should be interconnected to everybody. And that's what we're attempting to do in our multi-cloud strategy. I think, that's what customers want. So I'm optimistic that's the way the world will settle out. We'll get rid of these fees for moving data from cloud-to-cloud and all the clouds will be interconnected, and customers can pick their favorite service from their favorite cloud and mix and match whatever they want to use and do it easily and seamlessly.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a bit deeper on just precisely how many deployment models you guys are offering for OCI because it feels as though that is getting particularly differentiated as we start to think of sovereign cloud, GovCloud, more private cloud, given the conservative posture for AI and data privacy. So how do we think about how much of an advantage that is providing in sales cycles? And maybe in that massive $30-plus billion in the second half RPO, but also just comment on the magnitude of that opportunity going forward.\nLarry Ellison: I'm going to take a swing at this one. We can -- every medium-sized on-premise customer that Oracle has could have a private -- full Oracle cloud where they have no neighbors. They are the only user of that Oracle Cloud, and we can install that in their existing data centers. Nobody else can do that. You have to move to the public cloud. Now we have public cloud, we have a lot of public cloud regions. We love the public cloud. But if you're very conservative and you want to absolutely maximize security and that's important to you. We can put in a cloud, a full Oracle Cloud, and we run it. We pay for the heart -- again, it's an Oracle region. We put in Oracle cloud region and let me just make up a name. Samsung, we could build a cloud region for Samsung. In fact, two cloud regions is for Samsung. We could do two cloud regions making up names, General Motors, Ford, any company. Those are pretty big companies, but much smaller companies as well. So we're the only ones that give you an option to have the full capability of a public cloud run by Oracle, all of our services, every single 1 of our services, you don't pay for the hardware, you just pay for what you use, put that model directly on your premises. And you can use it and no one else is in that cloud. We can do that. No one else can do it. We can put them on ships and on submarines, no one else can do it because we can start very, very small. All Oracle clouds are identical, except for scale. All Oracle clouds have all Oracle services. All Oracle clouds are fully automated because they're identical. They're fully automated. So one of the reasons we took a little bit longer to get our cloud out was because we built something quite different than what our competitors have. And that allows us to go from very small to very large, using the same automation software. I think some of our competitors, they're large data centers, some are quite different than other data centers. They might have different -- some services might be available on some data centers and not in others. They're not -- they did a very different approach to what we did. We had the advantage of seeing what all the other guys did and we took a different road. It took us a bit longer, but we think we're better off in terms of security. We're better off in terms of scalability. By the way, that means the ability to go down in size and up in size. It allows us to get to every corner of the globe, and provide a level of privacy for your data that other cloud providers cannot provide.\nSafra Catz: Yes. And because as Larry said, because whatever the deployment model is you don't have to compromise. Some of our competitors may offer some level of sovereignty or some level of disconnected, but they don't actually have all the services for us, and the reason we've been so successful is whether it's disconnected or sovereign or whatever it is, the customer always gets everything. All services, not just some services and they get to deploy it any way they want, and they get the security or the regulatory requirements, sovereignty may be very critical. And for most governments, they don't want their data in the public cloud out and about. They want to have its sovereign to their country. And so no compromises, no compromises on the services and no compromises on security.\nAlex Zukin: It also sounds like you guys have a better price in most cases. So thanks, again to [indiscernible] tough quarter.\nSafra Catz: Much, because we are so much faster when you use our cloud, it is new. It's modern, but it also is technical advantages and so it runs your workload so much more quickly. And when you pay by the minute, the second, the hour, if your workload ends in [1/10] (ph) time, you pay a 1/10th the price. That's very hard to compete with.\nLarry Ellison: One last comment -- maybe one last comment. The other thing is our cloud was designed not for hundreds of regions, but for thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of data centers and regions. That's why we had to put in a high degree of automation. There is no way we could run these data centers manually. There are too many of them, and we're building them to do fast. We couldn't hire people fast enough and train people fast enough. And the risk of them making a mistake, an error is the risk -- well, they start exposing our customers' data. So they are highly automated. It's a little bit like I apply to myself, and comparing it to the satellites that Elon Musk puts in the sky. StarLink has -- they're more -- he has more satellites than everyone else in the world combined because, again it is a very different \u2013 it is a satellite system, Starlink, that's designed for a very large number of satellites that are highly automated. And same model lots and lots of them, 100% or nearly 100% automation to run these clouds.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on the cloud momentum. Larry, Safra, I was wondering if you could just expand a bit on the OpenAI announcement this afternoon. Just what that entails in terms of how you'll be working with them or Microsoft? Are there certain workloads they'll be working on with you directly. Can you just give us whatever additional color you can on that deal, obviously very excited. Thanks.\nSafra Catz: Well. Go ahead. No, you can. Go ahead.\nLarry Ellison: Okay. All right. Well, we are building a very, very large data center, very big about half of a huge data center. We're building for them lots of NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA interconnect, liquid cooled and they are primarily for training. I mean not inference things. It's we're doing masses and masses of training. And I don't know, that's what we're doing and the training goes beyond languages because now these systems are -- even the call -- even though they are called large language models, they really -- part of the proper name is probably neural networks, they're neural networks, and they're trained not just with language, but masses of images as well. For example, Oracle is very involved with taking biopsy slides and using microscopes to read biopsy slides, recording those images and then using AI to diagnose cancer from these biopsies. It is one of the projects we're working on the medical side of our business. And these large language models, strangely enough, are also looking at biopsies. They're not just reading things language. They are also looking at images and interpreting images. So that is actually a bigger and more complicated problem than understanding language. That's what's so exciting about -- again second time I mentioned Elon and Elon company. Tesla is very close to getting full service driving authorized in China. I'm not speaking at it at school. I think the Chinese government is moving along the full self-driving, self-driving in China. In order to train a car to do full self-driving, you trained on vast amounts of images because the car has to look at these images and then decide what it's going to do next. That's what it does. It doesn't speak, it responds to what it sees. That's a very different problem than answering a question posed in any language. So everyone is going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data. It is a huge amount of additional training, and we are right in the middle of it.\nKirk Materne: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question today comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you for taking my question. My question, I think, is for Safra. Safra, the IaaS revenue growth has been really impressive and it has been for a while here, but perhaps even more so the last couple of quarters, especially is the backlog given its scale. And this may be somewhat of an obvious question for you, but it's based on my conversation with investors. There's two high-profile topics that I want to make sure we understand what the contribution has been today versus next year. And that's Oracle database at Azure and AI in general. We've heard a lot of conversation about the former when we speak to partners and customers in the field. And you've spoken a lot about the latter today. So beyond conversation volume, can you talk a little bit more about what the contribution of these two topics has been to that impressive IaaS revenue growth in this quarter versus what we should expect that contribution to be in fiscal 2025.\nSafra Catz: Okay. I would tell you that both of them, both whether it's database at Azure or even the AI workloads as they come on board, they are all incremental to anything you saw so far in our revenues, okay? The database at Azure, those centers are just going live now. So even though we are selling quite a bit of ARR there, these are small and growing very, very fast. So the revenue in Q4 of, let's say, Azure was very small. Q1 will be 10 times as much. Q2 will be potentially 30 times as much. So it is extremely incremental to our current run rate. By the way, that is also true to -- we've already -- we have revenue -- AI revenue so far. Yes, we do, and we've been announcing those. These contracts that we are signing -- that we've signed at the end of Q3 and that are signed at the end of Q4 are so much larger in size that they will be incremental to everything you saw this past year, literally incremental added by quite a bit. So it is going to be -- this is a very exciting time, obviously. And everything is incremental to what you've seen so far because it dwarfed it in many ways.\nJohn DiFucci: That is really clear, and it really speaks to, I think, what you started talking about a long time ago, especially a lot more publicly, I don't know in the fall of 2022, but thanks. That's really clear.\nKen Bond : Thank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an absolutely incredible quarter. As you know, Oracle's Q4 is known for customers purchasing large software license contracts to power their businesses. But because of the pivot to the cloud, this Q4 was powered by the enormous demand for our cloud services. And they showed up in RPO or Remaining Performance Obligations. In Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contract in our history, led by huge demand for training large language models, as well as record levels of sales for OCI, autonomous, fusion, and net suite. RPO was $98 billion, up $18 billion from Q3, and up 44% year-over-year from $68 billion last year. And we are trading one-time non-recurring license revenue in return for much bigger strategic customer commitments for multi-year cloud revenue, from which we expect to further accelerate our revenue growth rates. This is exactly what we've been targeting, and it bolsters my confidence that our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance, as well as our growth rates, will only get stronger and accelerate. In short, this Q4 marks the full emergence of our high growth cloud businesses. Now, I started talking about this tipping [0.4] (ph) years ago, and you've seen it continue to play out in our results since then. As a reminder, we accelerated our US dollar revenue growth rate from negative one in fiscal year [2020] (ph) to plus eight this past year if you exclude Cerner. In addition, EPS has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate over that same period. And both operating cash flow and free cash flow, which of course we report on a trailing 12 month basis, were each declining 10% four years ago. This year, they grew 9% and 39% respectively. Now customer conversations are now absolutely fully focused on our cloud services as the results clearly show. So let me give you just a couple of examples -- a few examples. First, as you saw, OpenAI selected Oracle to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle Cloud infrastructure. Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost effective AI infrastructure. In total, we signed over 30 AI contracts for over $12 billion this quarter, and nearly $17 billion this year. Second, we continue to expand our work helping companies use our cloud applications portfolio to reinvent their businesses. As an example, a very large enterprise tech company signed a contract in Q4 for over $600 million where we will be helping them transform their operations with Fusion to enable them to become more agile, faster growing, and more profitable. May I say in the process, we will replace out many of our competitors product. These cross-pillar cloud deals or suite deals, focus on business process reengineering that incorporate multiple cloud applications that no one else can offer. And I want to point out, by the way that today is day 11 of our new fiscal year and we are once again, announcing our results not only for the quarter but the year and giving guidance, making us faster than any other public company by a launch. We are able to do this because of Fusion applications and that is why companies are choosing Fusion and our wonderful teams are showing them the way. And third, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed another multi-cloud partnership this time with Google. OCI and Google Cloud Network interconnect is available immediately in 10 regions, and we will be live with Oracle database at Google Cloud in September, where customers can get direct access to Oracle Database Services running on OCI, deployed in Google Cloud data centers. So what's driving this? Well, it is all about our comprehensive, highly differentiated and secure cloud offering. Customers have progressed from their initial curiosity about Oracle Cloud into full-blown rollout. We have the most secure, complete and cost-effective set of enterprise applications and infrastructure cloud technologies of any vendor. Not only are our cloud technologies vertically integrated to work together, but we offer flexible deployment models like public cloud, multi-cloud, sovereign clubs, dedicated cloud or any other way our customers ask us to deliver. And we also offer Oracle Alloy, where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. Now I'm now going to dive into the details of Q4 and finish my prepared remarks with how this strength and momentum will impact fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Okay. So let's start. In Q4, the dollar strengthened from the time of my Q4 guidance, so we saw a 1% currency headwind to total revenue and a $0.01 currency headwind to EPS. As usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate because this is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue that is SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.7 billion up 23%, including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 20% at $5.3 billion. And SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10% and IaaS revenue of $2 billion, up 42% on top of last year's 77% growth. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.2 billion, up 10%, driven again by our strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database and OCI. Application subscription revenues which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 6%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.7 billion and were up 16%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support were $5.6 billion up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 42%. Excluding legacy hosting, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services grew 44%, with an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 53% were it not for continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscriptions, which includes database license support, were up 6% and highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 26% and now have an annualized revenue of $2 billion. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either to OCI directly or using database at Azure or database at Google Cloud. We expect these cloud database services will be that third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic [SaaS] (ph). Consistent with our strategic direction and reflecting customer preference for cloud services, software license revenues were down 14% and to $1.8 billion. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.3 billion. That's up 4% if you include Cerner, up 5% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. The gross margin percentages for software support and SaaS are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. Gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To that point, though the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 8% in Q4. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year. The operating margin was 47%, up from 44% last year, as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our business. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate came out over 1% higher than my guidance at 20.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.63 and GAAP EPS was $1.11 in USD. As a reminder, the non-GAAP tax rate last year was 9.2%, and this had an adverse effect on this quarter's EPS growth. Non-GAAP pretax income grew 14% in constant currency. So you can figure out that had we had the same tax rate last year as this year, net income would have grown 14% and EPS would have been up 12% in CD, 11% in USD. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $53 billion up 6%. Total cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription-based and accounts for nearly [3/4] (ph) of total revenue was $39.4 billion, up 11%. Total application subscription revenues grew 9% and infrastructure subscription revenue grew 13%. Total cloud services, excluding Cerner, were up 26% to [$17.2 billion] (ph). SaaS revenue, excluding Cerner was up 13% to $10.4 billion for the year. IaaS and cloud infrastructure revenue was up 50% to $6.8 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 66% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $5.56 in USD, up 9% in USD and the full year operating margin percentage was 44%, up from 42% last year. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.3 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 9% and free cash flow was $11.8 billion, up 39%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion. As I mentioned our remaining performance obligations, or RPO is now $98 billion, up 44% in constant currency and the portion excluding Cerner, if you're curious was up 60%. We signed several large deals in this quarter, and we have many more -- many, many more in the pipeline. Approximately 39% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses. Now while we spent $3.5 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $2.8 billion shown in the cash flow statement is lower simply, as a result of timing of payments. We are working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. At this moment, we have 76 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another 19 being built. We have 11 database at Azure sites live and more locations with Microsoft coming online soon. We will have 12 Oracle database at Google Cloud sites live this year. We also have 13 dedicated regions live and 15 more planned. We have several national security regions and EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two alloy cloud regions live with 11 more plant. Of course, we also have many, many, many cloud customer installations as I mentioned earlier, the sizing and flexibility and -- the size and flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredibly advantageous for us in the marketplace. This quarter, we purchased 1.25 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I discuss my guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2025, I do just want you to have a couple of notes. The first is that in Q4, we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2024. Also, I will no longer breaking out the Cerner business in my results. And even though it will begin to grow modestly throughout the year in both revenue and operating margin, it's not necessary to break it out anymore and because it is now operating in a growth mode. Now to guidance. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong cloud demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter as OCI capacity increases to meet demand. We believe our momentum, our current momentum will continue as our pipeline is growing even faster than bookings and our win rates are going higher as well. I expect fiscal year 2025 cloud infrastructure services to grow faster than the 50% we reported this year. CapEx In fiscal year 2025 will probably be double what it is in fiscal year 2024 -- what it was in fiscal year 2024. Okay. Beyond this fiscal year, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal year 2026 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. However, given our strong bookings results, I believe some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. We are going to provide you a more fulsome update on all of this at the Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle Cloud World in Las Vegas in September. Okay. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a negative 1% effect on my revenue and either $0.01 or $0.02 negative on EPS in Q1. However, as you all know, actual currency impact may be more or less, I just can't get that now. Total revenue for Q1 are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and using the currency situation as it is now, they're expected to grow from 5% to 7% in USD. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and 20% to 22% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $1.33 and $1.37 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 10% to 14% and be between $1.31 and $1.35, but this time in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. And as always, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates to vary from my guidance. Okay. I know that was long. But with that, let me turn it to Larry for his comments. It's all about capacity. It is -- as we bring the capacity online wherever it's going online around the world is when those workloads are coming over. A lot of the engineering work is done in advance so that those customers know how they can operate. They bring smaller workloads, but the bigger workloads, they are just waiting for us to go online and make it available to them. It is really that level. We are scheduling them on our availability. And as I mentioned, our pipeline to take more deals is all about us just getting the capacity up and live and moving forward. Yes. Well, it's not a problem. It's just the schedule. As things come online, as the data centers go live or as we deliver the computers, they are just getting -- it's just very straightforward. There's no magic here. These customers have done a lot of the analysis in the engineering in advance and have tested us or competed us against our competitors and have chosen us very -- already understanding how we work, and they're just waiting for us to give them more capacity. I don't know, Larry you wanted \u2013 started with that. Yes. And because as Larry said, because whatever the deployment model is you don't have to compromise. Some of our competitors may offer some level of sovereignty or some level of disconnected, but they don't actually have all the services for us, and the reason we've been so successful is whether it's disconnected or sovereign or whatever it is, the customer always gets everything. All services, not just some services and they get to deploy it any way they want, and they get the security or the regulatory requirements, sovereignty may be very critical. And for most governments, they don't want their data in the public cloud out and about. They want to have its sovereign to their country. And so no compromises, no compromises on the services and no compromises on security. Much, because we are so much faster when you use our cloud, it is new. It's modern, but it also is technical advantages and so it runs your workload so much more quickly. And when you pay by the minute, the second, the hour, if your workload ends in [1/10] (ph) time, you pay a 1/10th the price. That's very hard to compete with. Well. Go ahead. No, you can. Go ahead. Okay. I would tell you that both of them, both whether it's database at Azure or even the AI workloads as they come on board, they are all incremental to anything you saw so far in our revenues, okay? The database at Azure, those centers are just going live now. So even though we are selling quite a bit of ARR there, these are small and growing very, very fast. So the revenue in Q4 of, let's say, Azure was very small. Q1 will be 10 times as much. Q2 will be potentially 30 times as much. So it is extremely incremental to our current run rate. By the way, that is also true to -- we've already -- we have revenue -- AI revenue so far. Yes, we do, and we've been announcing those. These contracts that we are signing -- that we've signed at the end of Q3 and that are signed at the end of Q4 are so much larger in size that they will be incremental to everything you saw this past year, literally incremental added by quite a bit. So it is going to be -- this is a very exciting time, obviously. And everything is incremental to what you've seen so far because it dwarfed it in many ways."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. I'm going to start by repeating something Safra said. In Q4, Oracle's company-wide RPO increased 44% to $98 billion. In AI alone, we signed contracts with 30 different customers for $12.5 billion in new AI business. These astonishing RPO numbers 44% and $98 billion were driven by massive increases in sales of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI. So who are the companies choosing to use Oracle Cloud Services and Oracle data centers. Well, here are a few names: NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, X AI, Open AI, coherent dozens more. In other words, the world's largest cloud companies and the world's most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle cloud services and data centers. So can -- so why are they working with Oracle, because Oracle's Gen 2 cloud infrastructure is different. OCI's area network moves data much faster. And when you charge by the minute, faster also means less expensive. OCI trains large language models several times faster and at a fraction of the cost of other clouds. OCI's Critical cloud software, the operating system and the database are fully Autonomous. At OCI, human beings do not run the operating system or the database, Autonomous software robots do. No one else has this level of autonomy in the cloud. Eliminating human labor eliminate human error. Almost all cloud security breaches begin with human error, eliminating the possibility of human error is the only way to make certain your cloud data is not stolen. That's it. The most important technology companies in the world are using OCI because it's faster, less expensive and more secure. Easy to say, not easy to do. Back to you, Ken. Okay. Well, I think in OCI, we've talked for a while about our ability to build very small data centers, one you could put in a shipper, a submarine or a full cloud, a full Oracle cloud, we will soon have in six standard half racks to go into a conventional data center. So virtually any one of our customers could choose to have the full Oracle Cloud in their data center with every service, every service in the cloud. And they could scale that up quite extraordinarily large. So we talk about the fact that we can start very small and that's a huge difference between us and our competitors. So we can actually put it again customer by customer, small countries, we can do. What we haven't talked so much about is we're also building the largest data centers in the world. We talked about -- I think we talked briefly about one last call, where we can park -- it's a 70-megawatt data center where we can park eight 747s nose to tail in the data center, the huge AI training data center. While we're also building a 200-megawatt data center. In fact, this past quarter, we sold about half of that data center for the -- for a period of time. So we're now bringing 200 megawatt data centers online. So we are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers, all the way up to 200 megawatt data centers ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to-date. This AI race is going to go on for a long time. It's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current. And that's going to take larger and larger data centers. And some of the data centers we have that we're planning are actually even bigger. There -- some are getting very close to our there, say a 1 gigawatt, which is a pretty good-sized city or one enormous AI cloud training data center. No one else can span this range. And in every case, we have unbelievably fast networks that are part of this, the data centers we are building include the power plants and the transmission of the power directly into the data center and liquid cooling. And because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch. And that's what we've been doing for some time. And that's what we'll continue to do. And currently, we are leading the pack and being able to deliver that quality and that scale of data center. I guess I can start. Well, we believe in giving customers choice. And customers want choice. Customers are using multiple clouds, not only infrastructure cloud, but they might have sales force applications or Workday applications \u2013 or they use multiple cloud in their business right now. So it's very important, we think that these -- that all the clouds become interconnected. So we're thrilled to have the connection with Microsoft and be building OCI data centers inside of it -- right inside of Azure. So the computers are next to each other to minimize network costs and network latency, which is all good things. We're doing the same thing with Google. We would love to do the same thing with AWS. We think we should be interconnected to everybody. And that's what we're attempting to do in our multi-cloud strategy. I think, that's what customers want. So I'm optimistic that's the way the world will settle out. We'll get rid of these fees for moving data from cloud-to-cloud and all the clouds will be interconnected, and customers can pick their favorite service from their favorite cloud and mix and match whatever they want to use and do it easily and seamlessly. I'm going to take a swing at this one. We can -- every medium-sized on-premise customer that Oracle has could have a private -- full Oracle cloud where they have no neighbors. They are the only user of that Oracle Cloud, and we can install that in their existing data centers. Nobody else can do that. You have to move to the public cloud. Now we have public cloud, we have a lot of public cloud regions. We love the public cloud. But if you're very conservative and you want to absolutely maximize security and that's important to you. We can put in a cloud, a full Oracle Cloud, and we run it. We pay for the heart -- again, it's an Oracle region. We put in Oracle cloud region and let me just make up a name. Samsung, we could build a cloud region for Samsung. In fact, two cloud regions is for Samsung. We could do two cloud regions making up names, General Motors, Ford, any company. Those are pretty big companies, but much smaller companies as well. So we're the only ones that give you an option to have the full capability of a public cloud run by Oracle, all of our services, every single 1 of our services, you don't pay for the hardware, you just pay for what you use, put that model directly on your premises. And you can use it and no one else is in that cloud. We can do that. No one else can do it. We can put them on ships and on submarines, no one else can do it because we can start very, very small. All Oracle clouds are identical, except for scale. All Oracle clouds have all Oracle services. All Oracle clouds are fully automated because they're identical. They're fully automated. So one of the reasons we took a little bit longer to get our cloud out was because we built something quite different than what our competitors have. And that allows us to go from very small to very large, using the same automation software. I think some of our competitors, they're large data centers, some are quite different than other data centers. They might have different -- some services might be available on some data centers and not in others. They're not -- they did a very different approach to what we did. We had the advantage of seeing what all the other guys did and we took a different road. It took us a bit longer, but we think we're better off in terms of security. We're better off in terms of scalability. By the way, that means the ability to go down in size and up in size. It allows us to get to every corner of the globe, and provide a level of privacy for your data that other cloud providers cannot provide. One last comment -- maybe one last comment. The other thing is our cloud was designed not for hundreds of regions, but for thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of data centers and regions. That's why we had to put in a high degree of automation. There is no way we could run these data centers manually. There are too many of them, and we're building them to do fast. We couldn't hire people fast enough and train people fast enough. And the risk of them making a mistake, an error is the risk -- well, they start exposing our customers' data. So they are highly automated. It's a little bit like I apply to myself, and comparing it to the satellites that Elon Musk puts in the sky. StarLink has -- they're more -- he has more satellites than everyone else in the world combined because, again it is a very different \u2013 it is a satellite system, Starlink, that's designed for a very large number of satellites that are highly automated. And same model lots and lots of them, 100% or nearly 100% automation to run these clouds. Okay. All right. Well, we are building a very, very large data center, very big about half of a huge data center. We're building for them lots of NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA interconnect, liquid cooled and they are primarily for training. I mean not inference things. It's we're doing masses and masses of training. And I don't know, that's what we're doing and the training goes beyond languages because now these systems are -- even the call -- even though they are called large language models, they really -- part of the proper name is probably neural networks, they're neural networks, and they're trained not just with language, but masses of images as well. For example, Oracle is very involved with taking biopsy slides and using microscopes to read biopsy slides, recording those images and then using AI to diagnose cancer from these biopsies. It is one of the projects we're working on the medical side of our business. And these large language models, strangely enough, are also looking at biopsies. They're not just reading things language. They are also looking at images and interpreting images. So that is actually a bigger and more complicated problem than understanding language. That's what's so exciting about -- again second time I mentioned Elon and Elon company. Tesla is very close to getting full service driving authorized in China. I'm not speaking at it at school. I think the Chinese government is moving along the full self-driving, self-driving in China. In order to train a car to do full self-driving, you trained on vast amounts of images because the car has to look at these images and then decide what it's going to do next. That's what it does. It doesn't speak, it responds to what it sees. That's a very different problem than answering a question posed in any language. So everyone is going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data. It is a huge amount of additional training, and we are right in the middle of it."

We had another excellent quarter with third-quarter revenue coming in as expected and EPS $0.02 above the high end of my guidance range. Now, before I get into the results of the quarter I wanted to touch on the strength of our infrastructure cloud business. OCI has emerged as the largest driver of our overall revenue acceleration growing much, much faster than our cloud competitors. Customers have figured out that by moving to OCI they can really get more while paying less, but it's not just the cost that matters to our customers. Beyond the superior price performance of OCI customers are choosing Oracle and Oracle services for multiple reasons. First, we know better than anyone what it takes to run the full stack of technology that goes into mission-critical workloads. I'm talking about running at enterprise scale with comprehensive security and unparalleled support and that's from decades of experience running the world's most important workloads and optimizing clustering technology, which is critical to artificial intelligence, workloads, and database services. Secondly, our AI capabilities are unique as they're built-in to help customers drive business outcomes. This is more than integrating generative AI across our Fusion and Industry Cloud applications and autonomous database, which we have done. It's also about enabling and refining these AI models with the customer's own data to better understand and serve their operations without them losing control of their own data. Third, we provide deployment flexibility for customers based on how they want to run in the cloud. In addition to offering public cloud services, we remain the only vendor which also offers a dedicated and complete cloud of customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner cloud so customers don't have to compromise the services they receive while meeting their deployment needs. And finally, we provide multi-cloud offerings so customers can consume our cloud services in the public cloud of their choice. We offer Oracle database at Azure with Microsoft as well as MySQL HeatWave through multiple clouds and you can expect more multi-cloud services to come. Now to Q3 results, which I'd like to point out I had the actual results on day five and signed off with my auditors days ago. So I'm just bragging a little bit but I couldn't help it, I know a lot of CFOs are pretty jealous. As I mentioned earlier, total revenue came in at the midpoint of my constant-currency guidance and EPS was above the high-end of guidance. As was the case when I gave guidance last quarter, currency had little effects in Q3. But I'll still discuss our results using constant currency growth rates in the few areas that the rates are slightly different. So here we go. Cloud revenue that's SaaS and IaaS excluding Cerner was $4.4 billion, up 26%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $5.1 billion with IaaS revenue of $1.8 billion, up 49%, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 14%. This quarter marks the first time our total cloud revenue is more than our total license support revenue. So we have crossed over total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter with $10 billion, up 11% driven again by our Strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 10%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure revenues which includes license support were $5.4 billion and up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 49%. Excluding Legacy Hosting Services, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 52% with an annualized revenue of $6.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Where if not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support were up 5%. And highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 34% and now has annualized revenue of $1.9 billion. Very importantly, has on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and OCI. Software license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 7% including Cerner and up 9% excluding Cerner. Now to margins, the gross margins for Cloud Services and License Support was 77%. This is as before a result of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS gross margin percentages are consistent with last year while IaaS gross margins improved substantially year-over-year. While we continue to build data center capacity, overall gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. And to that point, gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 8% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin was 44%, up from 42% last year as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our operating expenses, which continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was very close to my guidance at 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 in USD, up 16% in both USD and constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.85. At quarter-end, we had nearly $9.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion, up 18% and free cash flow was $12.3 billion, up 68%. Capital expenditures were $6 billion over the same time period as we continue to see cash-flow benefits from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation or RPO is now over $8 billion with the portion excluding Cerner up 41% in constant currency. We signed several large deals this quarter and we have many more in the pipeline. Approximately 43% of our total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see first-hand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses. And we expect to have some very nice joint announcements with NVIDIA next week. Now while we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in the cash-flow statements is slightly lower just due to the timing of payments. So the $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for. We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be somewhere around $7 billion to $7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4 CapEx should be considerably higher. To that point, we now have 68 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another eight being built. 12 of these public-cloud regions interconnect with Azure and more locations with Microsoft are coming online soon. We also have 11 dedicated region slots and 13 more planned. Several national security regions in EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live with five more planned where Oracle Partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside Oracle Cloud. And of course, we have also many, many, many clouded customer installations. As I mentioned earlier the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredible advantage for us in the marketplace. And as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share today. Now, before I dive into Q4 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see for the next 12 months or so. As demand for our Cloud Services continues getting stronger, our pipeline is growing even faster and our win rates are going higher as well. As our supply constraints ease revenue growth rates will accelerate higher as our capacity expands and we get into fiscal year '25. I should also say that we continue to expect the FY '24 of which we are now in the fourth quarter, total revenue excluding Cerner will accelerate from last year as it has for the past three years and will likely be significantly higher in FY '25. In addition, Cerner, which is a significant headwind this year, we expect to return to growth next year. And final - and I remain firmly committed to our FY '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth. However, some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis as always. And if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, of course, actual currency impact may be different. So, at least right now, all the numbers are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 4% to 6%. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow 6% to 8%. The total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 22% to 24% as more capacity comes online in Q4. The EPS growth rate will be affected by the compare as our Q4 tax rate last year was 9.2%, which I believe most of you have already accounted for in your models. And my EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As always, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary from my guidance as stated last year. So with that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be down 2% or to flat and be between a $1.62 and $1.66. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Well, Oracle signed another big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with NVIDIA in Q3. Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure business is booming. That's become pretty clear to everybody. But in addition to selling infrastructure for training AI large language models, Oracle is also completely re-engineering its industry-specific applications to take full advantage of generative Artificial Intelligence. The best example of this is in Healthcare where Oracle did not just add a bit of AI around the edges of the existing applications. Instead, we developed completely new applications using our Apex Application Generator and our Autonomous Database. These all new applications use generative AI throughout the application. The best example is in Healthcare where our new Ambulatory Clinic System is being delivered to customers this Q4. This completely new application features a voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant. The Clinical Digital Assistant listens to a doctor's consultations with a patient and automatically generates prescriptions, Doctor's orders, doctor's notes, then automatically updates the patient's electronic health records. The Clinical Digital Assistant's voice interface makes our new healthcare systems dramatically easier to use and saves hours of doctors precious time every day which now can be spent with patients rather than typing into a computer. The delivery of our new AI-centric healthcare cloud applications, including the Ambulatory Clinic System, the Clinical Digital Assistant, and the Health Data Intelligence System will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' healthcare systems and transform Oracle Health and Cerner into a high-growth business for years to come. Ken, back to you.\nSafra Catz: We don't hear you, Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you. Thank you, Larry. Sorry about that. Krista, if you could please poll the audience for questions and if we can proceed from there? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Safra, the infrastructure as a service growth of 49% implies a herculean increase in new business coming online, new ARR the way we model it anyway something I just thought you wouldn't be able to do this quarter given how much you had to do though we've realized we don't know the timing of when deals come online. But last quarter you said you were going to reallocate resources to focus on some of these very large OCI deals to get them implemented earlier so you start to get revenue earlier. Is that what happened this quarter? Is that what we're seeing or is that still to come?\nSafra Catz: Honestly, John, that is still to come. So, this is just pretty much our regular way business. That's what you're seeing. We have enormous amounts of demand. I tried to make that clear last quarter, and we have more capacity coming online. But we have tried to - we're trying to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacities and electricity and all of that and that's just - that all to come. This is really our regular way business and our customers just growing and a whole bunch of new customers, by the way. I think there are many, many customers who have come on and that haven't gotten capacity yet. We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over $1 billion that hasn't come online yet.\nLarry Ellison: Okay, let me add that Oracle has been building data centers at a record level and a lot of people I think are aware that we can build fairly small data centers to get started when we want to. But the unique thing about Oracle's data centers, they're all identical except for scale. We did not have custom data center. They all have all the Oracle services. They are all complete. One of the things that's unusual about them, they are all completely automated. They come up on their own and they kind of run their selves. I mean, look, we do have a bunch of people working on these data centers but they are extremely highly automated. Our operating system is Autonomous Linux. Our database is the Oracle Autonomous Database. Our new HeatWave database, Microsoft - MySQL HeatWave, it's highly automated. And therefore, we can build every time we build a data center, it's like the data center we've built before except for one thing, scale. We can go very small. We can get a full cloud data center with all the services in [10 racks]. But this is what I want to point out. We're also building the largest data centers in the world that we know of. We're building an AI data center in the United States where you could park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center. So, we are building large numbers of data centers, and we were - and some of those data centers are smallish, but some of those data centers are the largest AI data centers in the world. So, we're bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months because the demand is so high, we need to do that to satisfy our existing set of customers. To give you an idea. One more thing, in terms of data centers we're building 20 data centers from Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter. They're adding to that already. And there are other multi-cloud agreements that are being signed. There are multicloud - a number of multicloud agreements in Japan where computer manufacturers in Japan are adopting our cloud and will be reselling our cloud as partners. And we think NRI is already doing that, but there a number of other companies that are going to be doing that. So that's something we're seeing over demand for data centers or people who want to buy Alloy and then resell our cloud services with their proprietary cloud services on top of it. We're seeing that. So some of our largest customers all over the world want their own Oracle region. They don't want to share a public cloud, they want a cloud region dedicated or actually multiple cloud regions dedicated to that bank or that technology company or that telecom company. So they are building their own data centers which are - those are Oracle cloud data centers, they are that - yes, they're all identical. So we're able to automate and run those with not a lot of additional labor costs. It's a huge advantage for us.\nJohn DiFucci: Well, thank you, Larry, and Safra. Listen, what you put up this quarter in Infrastructure as a Service, it just looks pretty impressive. But it sounds like there's a lot more to come. Thank you for taking my question.\nLarry Ellison: John, my last comment will be - would be the growth in RPO is what's to come. And RPO is obviously growing faster than revenue because we can't meet the demand. That's the measure of demand, the $80 billion RPO is quite a - an acceleration of demand. So demand is not slowing down, it's actually increasing quite a bit.\nJohn DiFucci: Well, there were lot of questions on that last quarter, and I guess there won't be any on this one. Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, John. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hi, thank you, and congrats from me as well. I wanted to talk a little bit about Cerner. In the announcements, you talked about that most of Cerner now it's - is running out of your OCI. Well, first of all, let a very quick turnaround here, so well done. What's kind of the implications for that both from running efficiency but also innovation on the platform? Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Well, two things. One is we save a huge amount of money moving them into our standard data center. Our OCI costs are much lower than the cost of the Cerner dedicated data center in Kansas City. Also, the big thing that we're excited about is OCI is highly secure, it's got a highly secure perimeter and therefore those applications are much less vulnerable to ransomware or other kinds of attacks than if they were in a different kind of data center. So we're very happy that these are now secured. The third thing is now that they're in our cloud, we're able to update those applications on our regular three months cadence. So, we're able to modernize those customers that are in the cloud on a regular basis and start delivering our brand new applications that completely rewritten Cerner application. First for ambulatory clinics and then eventually for acute-care hospitals. But ambulatory clinics system is coming out this quarter and we're able to automatically deliver that system to existing customers. It's not a reimplementation. It is literally an update to what they've already got running on the Oracle Cloud. Even though it's an all-new application, I'm not going to see much technical detail, but it uses the same underlying data schema. So, we literally can bring up the new application without the customer having to go through any implementation process. We can do it just as an update, like when we ship a new version of Fusion to an existing Fusion customer. We can now ship a new version of - an all-new version of the Cerner application to a Cerner customer in OCI. So it allows us to modernize their infrastructure very, very rapidly, deliver the Voice - Clinical Digital Assistant, make the system easier to use, save doctor's time, deliver a lot more value put it in the diagnostic imaging systems that help data intelligence system, deliver all of that automatically on a regular three-months cadence. So, it allows us to modernize the Cerner base very, very quickly while keeping them safe from ransomware.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Yes, thanks. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you this afternoon. Larry and Safra, can you talk a little bit about CapEx? Your guidance implies almost doubling of CapEx in the fourth quarter and then what kind of trajectory is needed for the next fiscal year given this RPO growth? What kind of uptick is needed? And Larry, if you don't mind, what - if you can give some color on GPU availability and how that plays in versus data center requirements in terms of that spending? Thanks so much.\nSafra Catz: So, for fiscal year '25, looking at about $10 billion in CapEx because it's also involves not only some big centers, but it also involves expansions of existing centers. So we've already got some areas that we will be filling out. So at least preliminarily, we're looking at $10 billion for next year. And then it's not too complicated to figure out the math here when I'm looking at somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year and you've got all the numbers for one, two, and three at this point. And I would include for Q3 the one we just are announcing. I would add in the amount we haven't paid yet as the CapEx number for this quarter. Okay? And then I guess that would be and then Larry gets the second question. But anyway, so $2.1 billion for this quarter and you've got Q1 and Q2 and I'm going to be somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year, which is actually a little bit lower than I thought. But we were able to do pretty well. You know-how we spend very carefully.\nBen Reitzes: Great, thanks. And Larry, the amount that - how is the GPU availability in terms of hitting your goals and vis-a-vis other bottlenecks that could be out there?\nSafra Catz: Can I take at least part of this?\nBen Reitzes: Oh, yes, sure.\nSafra Catz: The GPU we are good. We are actually very good in our GPU access and capability. So, building the computers and that it's much more making sure we've got the power on that.\nLarry Ellison: Yes.\nBen Reitzes: Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: And as Safra says, we have - so, as Safra says, we have a great relationship with NVIDIA. They're a customer of ours as well as us being a customer of theirs and we work very closely together. So, that's going pretty well. Building these let them is the scale of some of these data centers is breathtaking. Again the one we're building in Salt Lake. Again, you can park 8747s nose-to-tail. We can give you a video of this thing under construction, but it's hard, I mean, it's breathtaking. So, there is a tremendous amount of demand, the data centers take longer to build, and we would like that said, we are getting very good at building them quickly and getting the building the power and the communication links in, we're doing faster than we have ever happened in the past. And the thing is once we deliver the hardware, the hardware comes up very, very quickly because the process of bringing up the hardware is now automated. It's very different than it used to be. So, we're able to bring additional capacity online very quickly if we have that the electric power and the communication lines. So, is the long pole in the tent is actually building the structure, connecting the electricity, connecting the communication lines.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks, Larry. Appreciate it. Congrats something OCI growth.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Wood: Great, thank you. Larry, just within the last few months you guys have enabled Oracle Database and OCI to be run on top of Azure, which seems like a fairly significant development. Can you talk about what the customer reception has been around this announcement? How you think it could change the arc of new investments on the Oracle Database platform? And what this means for potentially unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for Autonomous Database?\nLarry Ellison: Well, I think it is the key to unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for a - moving Oracle in general to the cloud in general and specifically the migration to Autonomous Database. Oracle, we expect the multicloud initiatives to continue to expand. We're seeing it expand in Japan, but we expected to expand amongst other hyperscalers to adopt a similar multi-cloud approach where we built and we built OCI regions inside of the coexisting with their existing cloud infrastructure. We think the world - the era of walled gardens is coming to an end where it used to be okay, I'm going to move all my stuff to AWS, trying to move all my stuff to Azure. What customers really want is the ability to use multiple clouds and for those multiple clouds to talk to one another. And I think - I mean in the era of the Internet and now cloud computing, it's really called Cloud Computing. It's not called a bunch of separate clouds. So we expect that multi-cloud to become the norm and Oracle to be available everywhere. And we - and that's what you said, we think that will preserve our franchise and database where we've been the number-one database in the IT ecosystem for a very long-time. We think that's going to preserve that franchise and expand it because the Autonomous Database is a unique piece of technology and there is nothing like it in the world, and maybe the most interesting thing, no one else is working on anything like that. No one else even trying to duplicate the Autonomous Database. So, we think it will be - it will become a very successful product in every cloud.\nDerrick Wood: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on a incredible bookings this quarter. Larry, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the interest level on Alloy in international markets where there might be a bit of a premium on data sovereignty and maybe how that's impacting the growth opportunity for OCI when we look out towards the balance of calendar '24? Thanks.\nLarry Ellison: Well, I think Japan is maybe the most interesting market where we had early success with NRI. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. No - what NRI has is just is an Oracle - a couple of Oracle Cloud regions which they resell in the financial services community inside of Japan. And one of their applications is a major stock exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange. So, think about how many clouds run stock exchanges, that would be ours. It's got to be highly secure, it can never go down, it's going to have extremely high transaction rates, we can do that. And the success of NRI is caused other - the other computer companies in Japan to become very, very interested and also reselling our cloud with - and we also have the ability that they can add on some of their own technology to our cloud so, our cloud is open so you can plug-in other things to the cloud. So, imagine a big computer company in Japan adopting the Oracle Cloud, reselling Autonomous Database, reselling all of our technologies because all we --we only make one kind of cloud, they're all the same and they have all of the services. But then that company can add their own services to there for their customers. We think all of the cloud companies in Japan are going to adopt OCI. Plus a lot of big companies, the big car companies in Japan. We want around their own, the phone companies in Japan will want their own, the technology companies in Japan will want their own Oracle regions. And because they are sovereign because they are highly secure and because they are highly cost-effective, so we think this allows us to enter a variety of new markets. Pretty much every government is going to want a sovereign cloud and a dedicated region for that government for not only to - so we see a number of countries. It's funny, we talked about winning business with companies. For the first time, we're beginning to win business country - per countries for sovereign cloud where the national government and the state governments are moving to that Oracle OCI region. And of course, it's got to be at least two of them for redundancy and disaster recovery. So, we have a number of countries where we're negotiating sovereign regions with the national government. We see that time and time again, major companies, governments, computer suppliers reselling our Alloy Cloud. The demand for our cloud regions is extraordinarily high. I believe we will end up - well, this is a funny prediction, but okay, we'll end up with more data centers and cloud regions than all the other hyperscalers combined.\nSafra Catz: Yes. I think that's the story.\nLarry Ellison: That's what I believe.\nSafra Catz: So, just to make sure you have all the numbers between Alloy and dedicated regions, we've got 13 lives. We've got 18 under-construction. And we've signed five new ones just this past quarter. So for us, it's - they're just - there's just a list we're going through and trying to get them all because they are such a unique capability and in such high demand.\nLarry Ellison: Yes. And let me just add one last thing. Microsoft does not compete for this business. AWS does not compete for this business. Google does not compete for this business. We're the only ones in this business.\nKirk Materne: Thank you, all.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much for taking my question. Larry, my question actually follows on your answer to Kirk's question because I think it's so important. In talking to one of your GSI partners we heard about a global public sector solution that they referred to as government in a box where Oracle in partnership with likes Starlink, the Tony Blair Project, our building solutions on top of OCI including [Absence Check] and even Cerner. So, literally run the entire country's digital operations. So, hoping you can add even a little bit more color about what you're doing here. How big an opportunity it is because it just seems like it's such a powerful example of the entire Oracle Cloud Stack coming together in a very meaningful way?\nLarry Ellison: All right. It is really, really - it is very interesting. And we've gone into the National Government and State Government applications in a very, very big way to give you an idea a little glimpse of what we're doing. Yes, because we can't deliver these cloud regions to medium-sized countries. So, for example, Serbia is standardizing on - or these Oracle Cloud regions for their National Government. We're automating their healthcare and people know that we're in the healthcare business. What they might not know is in cooperation with Starlink we're able to deliver an Internet service to - for the entire country. The rural part of the country, by the way, we can deliver the Internet and we have delivered the Internet. Let's say Kenya or Rwanda very inexpensively using Starlink and our sovereign cloud regions to backhaul the Internet traffic. So, you can bring every school in Serbia online the Internet connectivity even if they're rural doesn't matter. Every school, every hospital as is true of Rwanda, that's true of Kenya. We can do it very, very cost-effectively and one of the applications we have for agriculture, we actually do a national map of the country where we can show you each of the farms in the country, what they're growing - this farm is growing coffee, this farm is growing maze, this farm - what's part of the fields are getting enough nitrogen, which part of the fields are getting enough water? What corrective actions you need to take to increase your agricultural output? We're doing that again in concert with Elon Musk and SpaceX to do this kind of mapping to provide this AI-assisted and then these maps are AI-assisted help them plan their agricultural output and predict their agricultural output, predict markets, the logistics of the agricultural output during all of those things as next-generation national application. And it is one of the most exciting things we're doing, of course, we do procurement and accounting and human resources and recruiting for the government, we do all of those applications. But in some of the newer applications, regarding food security. Making sure all the schools are online. Rural growth schools are online. That rural hospitals are online. It's automating those rural hospitals. It's automating their vaccination program, their healthcare program across the board. These next-generation applications are very attractive. I'll tell you one other crazy thing that we do. It's another generative AI application. If you want to join the EU, it took Serbia eight years to harmonize their laws to be able to join the EU. Albania is facing the same thing. But with generative AI, we can read the entire corpus of the Albanian laws and actually harmonize their laws with the EU and probably more like 18-months to two years rather than the eight years it took Serbia. So, there are all sorts of interesting new AI applications out there that people you've probably never heard of before or at least I hadn't heard of before, until this last 12 months. Now that we've worked on and we're now in the process of delivering.\nBrad Zelnick: Really amazing stuff. Larry, thank you and congrats. And Safra, really great to see the firm reiteration of your fiscal '26 targets. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nSafra Catz: Thank you.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another excellent quarter with third-quarter revenue coming in as expected and EPS $0.02 above the high end of my guidance range. Now, before I get into the results of the quarter I wanted to touch on the strength of our infrastructure cloud business. OCI has emerged as the largest driver of our overall revenue acceleration growing much, much faster than our cloud competitors. Customers have figured out that by moving to OCI they can really get more while paying less, but it's not just the cost that matters to our customers. Beyond the superior price performance of OCI customers are choosing Oracle and Oracle services for multiple reasons. First, we know better than anyone what it takes to run the full stack of technology that goes into mission-critical workloads. I'm talking about running at enterprise scale with comprehensive security and unparalleled support and that's from decades of experience running the world's most important workloads and optimizing clustering technology, which is critical to artificial intelligence, workloads, and database services. Secondly, our AI capabilities are unique as they're built-in to help customers drive business outcomes. This is more than integrating generative AI across our Fusion and Industry Cloud applications and autonomous database, which we have done. It's also about enabling and refining these AI models with the customer's own data to better understand and serve their operations without them losing control of their own data. Third, we provide deployment flexibility for customers based on how they want to run in the cloud. In addition to offering public cloud services, we remain the only vendor which also offers a dedicated and complete cloud of customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner cloud so customers don't have to compromise the services they receive while meeting their deployment needs. And finally, we provide multi-cloud offerings so customers can consume our cloud services in the public cloud of their choice. We offer Oracle database at Azure with Microsoft as well as MySQL HeatWave through multiple clouds and you can expect more multi-cloud services to come. Now to Q3 results, which I'd like to point out I had the actual results on day five and signed off with my auditors days ago. So I'm just bragging a little bit but I couldn't help it, I know a lot of CFOs are pretty jealous. As I mentioned earlier, total revenue came in at the midpoint of my constant-currency guidance and EPS was above the high-end of guidance. As was the case when I gave guidance last quarter, currency had little effects in Q3. But I'll still discuss our results using constant currency growth rates in the few areas that the rates are slightly different. So here we go. Cloud revenue that's SaaS and IaaS excluding Cerner was $4.4 billion, up 26%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $5.1 billion with IaaS revenue of $1.8 billion, up 49%, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 14%. This quarter marks the first time our total cloud revenue is more than our total license support revenue. So we have crossed over total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter with $10 billion, up 11% driven again by our Strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 10%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure revenues which includes license support were $5.4 billion and up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 49%. Excluding Legacy Hosting Services, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 52% with an annualized revenue of $6.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Where if not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support were up 5%. And highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 34% and now has annualized revenue of $1.9 billion. Very importantly, has on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and OCI. Software license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 7% including Cerner and up 9% excluding Cerner. Now to margins, the gross margins for Cloud Services and License Support was 77%. This is as before a result of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS gross margin percentages are consistent with last year while IaaS gross margins improved substantially year-over-year. While we continue to build data center capacity, overall gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. And to that point, gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 8% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin was 44%, up from 42% last year as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our operating expenses, which continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was very close to my guidance at 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 in USD, up 16% in both USD and constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.85. At quarter-end, we had nearly $9.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion, up 18% and free cash flow was $12.3 billion, up 68%. Capital expenditures were $6 billion over the same time period as we continue to see cash-flow benefits from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation or RPO is now over $8 billion with the portion excluding Cerner up 41% in constant currency. We signed several large deals this quarter and we have many more in the pipeline. Approximately 43% of our total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see first-hand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses. And we expect to have some very nice joint announcements with NVIDIA next week. Now while we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in the cash-flow statements is slightly lower just due to the timing of payments. So the $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for. We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be somewhere around $7 billion to $7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4 CapEx should be considerably higher. To that point, we now have 68 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another eight being built. 12 of these public-cloud regions interconnect with Azure and more locations with Microsoft are coming online soon. We also have 11 dedicated region slots and 13 more planned. Several national security regions in EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live with five more planned where Oracle Partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside Oracle Cloud. And of course, we have also many, many, many clouded customer installations. As I mentioned earlier the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredible advantage for us in the marketplace. And as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share today. Now, before I dive into Q4 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see for the next 12 months or so. As demand for our Cloud Services continues getting stronger, our pipeline is growing even faster and our win rates are going higher as well. As our supply constraints ease revenue growth rates will accelerate higher as our capacity expands and we get into fiscal year '25. I should also say that we continue to expect the FY '24 of which we are now in the fourth quarter, total revenue excluding Cerner will accelerate from last year as it has for the past three years and will likely be significantly higher in FY '25. In addition, Cerner, which is a significant headwind this year, we expect to return to growth next year. And final - and I remain firmly committed to our FY '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth. However, some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis as always. And if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, of course, actual currency impact may be different. So, at least right now, all the numbers are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 4% to 6%. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow 6% to 8%. The total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 22% to 24% as more capacity comes online in Q4. The EPS growth rate will be affected by the compare as our Q4 tax rate last year was 9.2%, which I believe most of you have already accounted for in your models. And my EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As always, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary from my guidance as stated last year. So with that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be down 2% or to flat and be between a $1.62 and $1.66. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. We don't hear you, Ken. Honestly, John, that is still to come. So, this is just pretty much our regular way business. That's what you're seeing. We have enormous amounts of demand. I tried to make that clear last quarter, and we have more capacity coming online. But we have tried to - we're trying to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacities and electricity and all of that and that's just - that all to come. This is really our regular way business and our customers just growing and a whole bunch of new customers, by the way. I think there are many, many customers who have come on and that haven't gotten capacity yet. We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over $1 billion that hasn't come online yet. So, for fiscal year '25, looking at about $10 billion in CapEx because it's also involves not only some big centers, but it also involves expansions of existing centers. So we've already got some areas that we will be filling out. So at least preliminarily, we're looking at $10 billion for next year. And then it's not too complicated to figure out the math here when I'm looking at somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year and you've got all the numbers for one, two, and three at this point. And I would include for Q3 the one we just are announcing. I would add in the amount we haven't paid yet as the CapEx number for this quarter. Okay? And then I guess that would be and then Larry gets the second question. But anyway, so $2.1 billion for this quarter and you've got Q1 and Q2 and I'm going to be somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year, which is actually a little bit lower than I thought. But we were able to do pretty well. You know-how we spend very carefully. Can I take at least part of this? The GPU we are good. We are actually very good in our GPU access and capability. So, building the computers and that it's much more making sure we've got the power on that. Yes. I think that's the story. So, just to make sure you have all the numbers between Alloy and dedicated regions, we've got 13 lives. We've got 18 under-construction. And we've signed five new ones just this past quarter. So for us, it's - they're just - there's just a list we're going through and trying to get them all because they are such a unique capability and in such high demand. Thank you."

            "name": "Larry Ellison",
            "content": "Thank you, Safra. Well, Oracle signed another big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with NVIDIA in Q3. Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure business is booming. That's become pretty clear to everybody. But in addition to selling infrastructure for training AI large language models, Oracle is also completely re-engineering its industry-specific applications to take full advantage of generative Artificial Intelligence. The best example of this is in Healthcare where Oracle did not just add a bit of AI around the edges of the existing applications. Instead, we developed completely new applications using our Apex Application Generator and our Autonomous Database. These all new applications use generative AI throughout the application. The best example is in Healthcare where our new Ambulatory Clinic System is being delivered to customers this Q4. This completely new application features a voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant. The Clinical Digital Assistant listens to a doctor's consultations with a patient and automatically generates prescriptions, Doctor's orders, doctor's notes, then automatically updates the patient's electronic health records. The Clinical Digital Assistant's voice interface makes our new healthcare systems dramatically easier to use and saves hours of doctors precious time every day which now can be spent with patients rather than typing into a computer. The delivery of our new AI-centric healthcare cloud applications, including the Ambulatory Clinic System, the Clinical Digital Assistant, and the Health Data Intelligence System will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' healthcare systems and transform Oracle Health and Cerner into a high-growth business for years to come. Ken, back to you. Okay, let me add that Oracle has been building data centers at a record level and a lot of people I think are aware that we can build fairly small data centers to get started when we want to. But the unique thing about Oracle's data centers, they're all identical except for scale. We did not have custom data center. They all have all the Oracle services. They are all complete. One of the things that's unusual about them, they are all completely automated. They come up on their own and they kind of run their selves. I mean, look, we do have a bunch of people working on these data centers but they are extremely highly automated. Our operating system is Autonomous Linux. Our database is the Oracle Autonomous Database. Our new HeatWave database, Microsoft - MySQL HeatWave, it's highly automated. And therefore, we can build every time we build a data center, it's like the data center we've built before except for one thing, scale. We can go very small. We can get a full cloud data center with all the services in [10 racks]. But this is what I want to point out. We're also building the largest data centers in the world that we know of. We're building an AI data center in the United States where you could park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center. So, we are building large numbers of data centers, and we were - and some of those data centers are smallish, but some of those data centers are the largest AI data centers in the world. So, we're bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months because the demand is so high, we need to do that to satisfy our existing set of customers. To give you an idea. One more thing, in terms of data centers we're building 20 data centers from Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter. They're adding to that already. And there are other multi-cloud agreements that are being signed. There are multicloud - a number of multicloud agreements in Japan where computer manufacturers in Japan are adopting our cloud and will be reselling our cloud as partners. And we think NRI is already doing that, but there a number of other companies that are going to be doing that. So that's something we're seeing over demand for data centers or people who want to buy Alloy and then resell our cloud services with their proprietary cloud services on top of it. We're seeing that. So some of our largest customers all over the world want their own Oracle region. They don't want to share a public cloud, they want a cloud region dedicated or actually multiple cloud regions dedicated to that bank or that technology company or that telecom company. So they are building their own data centers which are - those are Oracle cloud data centers, they are that - yes, they're all identical. So we're able to automate and run those with not a lot of additional labor costs. It's a huge advantage for us. John, my last comment will be - would be the growth in RPO is what's to come. And RPO is obviously growing faster than revenue because we can't meet the demand. That's the measure of demand, the $80 billion RPO is quite a - an acceleration of demand. So demand is not slowing down, it's actually increasing quite a bit. Well, two things. One is we save a huge amount of money moving them into our standard data center. Our OCI costs are much lower than the cost of the Cerner dedicated data center in Kansas City. Also, the big thing that we're excited about is OCI is highly secure, it's got a highly secure perimeter and therefore those applications are much less vulnerable to ransomware or other kinds of attacks than if they were in a different kind of data center. So we're very happy that these are now secured. The third thing is now that they're in our cloud, we're able to update those applications on our regular three months cadence. So, we're able to modernize those customers that are in the cloud on a regular basis and start delivering our brand new applications that completely rewritten Cerner application. First for ambulatory clinics and then eventually for acute-care hospitals. But ambulatory clinics system is coming out this quarter and we're able to automatically deliver that system to existing customers. It's not a reimplementation. It is literally an update to what they've already got running on the Oracle Cloud. Even though it's an all-new application, I'm not going to see much technical detail, but it uses the same underlying data schema. So, we literally can bring up the new application without the customer having to go through any implementation process. We can do it just as an update, like when we ship a new version of Fusion to an existing Fusion customer. We can now ship a new version of - an all-new version of the Cerner application to a Cerner customer in OCI. So it allows us to modernize their infrastructure very, very rapidly, deliver the Voice - Clinical Digital Assistant, make the system easier to use, save doctor's time, deliver a lot more value put it in the diagnostic imaging systems that help data intelligence system, deliver all of that automatically on a regular three-months cadence. So, it allows us to modernize the Cerner base very, very quickly while keeping them safe from ransomware. Yes. And as Safra says, we have - so, as Safra says, we have a great relationship with NVIDIA. They're a customer of ours as well as us being a customer of theirs and we work very closely together. So, that's going pretty well. Building these let them is the scale of some of these data centers is breathtaking. Again the one we're building in Salt Lake. Again, you can park 8747s nose-to-tail. We can give you a video of this thing under construction, but it's hard, I mean, it's breathtaking. So, there is a tremendous amount of demand, the data centers take longer to build, and we would like that said, we are getting very good at building them quickly and getting the building the power and the communication links in, we're doing faster than we have ever happened in the past. And the thing is once we deliver the hardware, the hardware comes up very, very quickly because the process of bringing up the hardware is now automated. It's very different than it used to be. So, we're able to bring additional capacity online very quickly if we have that the electric power and the communication lines. So, is the long pole in the tent is actually building the structure, connecting the electricity, connecting the communication lines. Thank you. Well, I think it is the key to unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for a - moving Oracle in general to the cloud in general and specifically the migration to Autonomous Database. Oracle, we expect the multicloud initiatives to continue to expand. We're seeing it expand in Japan, but we expected to expand amongst other hyperscalers to adopt a similar multi-cloud approach where we built and we built OCI regions inside of the coexisting with their existing cloud infrastructure. We think the world - the era of walled gardens is coming to an end where it used to be okay, I'm going to move all my stuff to AWS, trying to move all my stuff to Azure. What customers really want is the ability to use multiple clouds and for those multiple clouds to talk to one another. And I think - I mean in the era of the Internet and now cloud computing, it's really called Cloud Computing. It's not called a bunch of separate clouds. So we expect that multi-cloud to become the norm and Oracle to be available everywhere. And we - and that's what you said, we think that will preserve our franchise and database where we've been the number-one database in the IT ecosystem for a very long-time. We think that's going to preserve that franchise and expand it because the Autonomous Database is a unique piece of technology and there is nothing like it in the world, and maybe the most interesting thing, no one else is working on anything like that. No one else even trying to duplicate the Autonomous Database. So, we think it will be - it will become a very successful product in every cloud. Well, I think Japan is maybe the most interesting market where we had early success with NRI. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. No - what NRI has is just is an Oracle - a couple of Oracle Cloud regions which they resell in the financial services community inside of Japan. And one of their applications is a major stock exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange. So, think about how many clouds run stock exchanges, that would be ours. It's got to be highly secure, it can never go down, it's going to have extremely high transaction rates, we can do that. And the success of NRI is caused other - the other computer companies in Japan to become very, very interested and also reselling our cloud with - and we also have the ability that they can add on some of their own technology to our cloud so, our cloud is open so you can plug-in other things to the cloud. So, imagine a big computer company in Japan adopting the Oracle Cloud, reselling Autonomous Database, reselling all of our technologies because all we --we only make one kind of cloud, they're all the same and they have all of the services. But then that company can add their own services to there for their customers. We think all of the cloud companies in Japan are going to adopt OCI. Plus a lot of big companies, the big car companies in Japan. We want around their own, the phone companies in Japan will want their own, the technology companies in Japan will want their own Oracle regions. And because they are sovereign because they are highly secure and because they are highly cost-effective, so we think this allows us to enter a variety of new markets. Pretty much every government is going to want a sovereign cloud and a dedicated region for that government for not only to - so we see a number of countries. It's funny, we talked about winning business with companies. For the first time, we're beginning to win business country - per countries for sovereign cloud where the national government and the state governments are moving to that Oracle OCI region. And of course, it's got to be at least two of them for redundancy and disaster recovery. So, we have a number of countries where we're negotiating sovereign regions with the national government. We see that time and time again, major companies, governments, computer suppliers reselling our Alloy Cloud. The demand for our cloud regions is extraordinarily high. I believe we will end up - well, this is a funny prediction, but okay, we'll end up with more data centers and cloud regions than all the other hyperscalers combined. That's what I believe. Yes. And let me just add one last thing. Microsoft does not compete for this business. AWS does not compete for this business. Google does not compete for this business. We're the only ones in this business. All right. It is really, really - it is very interesting. And we've gone into the National Government and State Government applications in a very, very big way to give you an idea a little glimpse of what we're doing. Yes, because we can't deliver these cloud regions to medium-sized countries. So, for example, Serbia is standardizing on - or these Oracle Cloud regions for their National Government. We're automating their healthcare and people know that we're in the healthcare business. What they might not know is in cooperation with Starlink we're able to deliver an Internet service to - for the entire country. The rural part of the country, by the way, we can deliver the Internet and we have delivered the Internet. Let's say Kenya or Rwanda very inexpensively using Starlink and our sovereign cloud regions to backhaul the Internet traffic. So, you can bring every school in Serbia online the Internet connectivity even if they're rural doesn't matter. Every school, every hospital as is true of Rwanda, that's true of Kenya. We can do it very, very cost-effectively and one of the applications we have for agriculture, we actually do a national map of the country where we can show you each of the farms in the country, what they're growing - this farm is growing coffee, this farm is growing maze, this farm - what's part of the fields are getting enough nitrogen, which part of the fields are getting enough water? What corrective actions you need to take to increase your agricultural output? We're doing that again in concert with Elon Musk and SpaceX to do this kind of mapping to provide this AI-assisted and then these maps are AI-assisted help them plan their agricultural output and predict their agricultural output, predict markets, the logistics of the agricultural output during all of those things as next-generation national application. And it is one of the most exciting things we're doing, of course, we do procurement and accounting and human resources and recruiting for the government, we do all of those applications. But in some of the newer applications, regarding food security. Making sure all the schools are online. Rural growth schools are online. That rural hospitals are online. It's automating those rural hospitals. It's automating their vaccination program, their healthcare program across the board. These next-generation applications are very attractive. I'll tell you one other crazy thing that we do. It's another generative AI application. If you want to join the EU, it took Serbia eight years to harmonize their laws to be able to join the EU. Albania is facing the same thing. But with generative AI, we can read the entire corpus of the Albanian laws and actually harmonize their laws with the EU and probably more like 18-months to two years rather than the eight years it took Serbia. So, there are all sorts of interesting new AI applications out there that people you've probably never heard of before or at least I hadn't heard of before, until this last 12 months. Now that we've worked on and we're now in the process of delivering."

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, cloud services and license support, is now 74% of the revenue, and it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen, and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now, more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things. Creating the second generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission critical systems. Third, we recognize that customers need deployment flexibility rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated cloud to customer, dedicated region, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out. Now, to the Q2 results. With total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and the EPS at the high end of guidance. Now, as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and we're up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55%, with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40%, and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen 2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4% including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%. This is because of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter-end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%. And free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to seek cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, nine national security regions, and two EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have seven Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many clouded customer installations. The sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantages for us in the marketplace. Finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal \u201826 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to this sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud Infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion dollar Cloud Infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for Cloud Infrastructure services and new Oracle cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by Generative AI customers, but also by nation states buying sovereign Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies, buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle cloud data centers, and perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers, co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle cloud data centers, co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle cloud database. We're able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated, with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services, and applications. Oracle cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, healthcare, and commercial workloads to the Oracle cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies, have also contracted with us to build Oracle cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate, and a huge US defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Larry. Emma, if we could please poll the audience for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. It's great to be speaking with you this afternoon. Do you mind going through your thoughts on the OCI trajectory from here and how you feel backlog will play out into revenue? And perhaps you can comment also, is the acceleration potential that you guided for due to getting more GPUs and more AI backlog moving into revenue? Thanks a lot.\nSafra Catz: Larry, you want me to take it or you?\nLarry Ellison: No, either one, Safra, you tell me.\nSafra Catz: How about I get started? So, where do we expect OCI to go from here? Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers handed over and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. So the reality is, as we roll out and we've got just so many moving parts as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online. And as you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use. And of course, also as more GPUs become available, and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand. Larry, I don't know if you want to say anything else?\nLarry Ellison: Yeah, well again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign two additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used and that's accurate. There's no reason why -- OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger and actually the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online. We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize it's not just GenAI demand. There is huge pent-up cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds, where people -- governments haven't been able to move their workloads. A lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, five, six, seven large companies in Japan that will be building at least two data centers, Oracle data centers each. So again, the demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast. And I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years.\nSafra Catz: Yes, we're not demand limited in any way right now.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Safra and Larry. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Thanks for the question. Thanks Larry for the -- and Safra, for those comments on the future OCI growth. So since Ben asked about the growth, and maybe I'll take a step back on the other part of all this, and that's the profit side. Per Larry's comments, you're building out a lot of capacity and Safra's comments agree with that, with the CapEx growth. But Clay's also spoken about the time it takes to build out those AI super clusters and I know that's not the only AI workloads you're doing, but that sounds like some pretty exciting stuff. And it takes time before you get revenue. I realize you're also seeing ramp up of those what I'll call core OCI deals like Uber, and you actually get revenue from them over time. But how should we think about cloud gross margins over time in this context with both those things? There's a lot happening here.\nSafra Catz: Yes, and I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I give you more detail, is I show you a number that is a mix of cloud and support. And obviously, support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works, and because we are at such a large scale. But the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable, and our IaaS, our OCI business, is improving profitability as it grows. And so the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up. So yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up. Because once the day -- the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space, but we grow in pieces. Unlike some of the others that they have to do a full out build out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue, that's not how we work. We -- and more and more of our -- so we start small and build up and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that?\nLarry Ellison: Yeah I do. I think one thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. So to give you an idea, Oracle Cloud -- to run Oracle Cloud we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the autonomous database. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated. Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system is fully autonomous. There's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software, but not running the software, it doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it costs us to run 10 in terms of DBAs or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux. So we have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things, we can bring them up relatively quickly and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated, there are far fewer errors and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving.\nJohn DiFucci: If I might, and Safra, go back to something you said, is it fair to assume that OCI gross margins have consistently grown over time, quarter to quarter?\nSafra Catz: Yes.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay, and then, and then, and then\u2026\nLarry Ellison: Grown a lot.\nJohn DiFucci: Grown a lot, okay. And then finally, the -- what Larry just said about the database, Safra, I've heard you say at times, we're at the beginning of the beginning of the transition of the database to cloud. So I know you have database in cloud today but that migration of the on-prem that's still to come pretty much.\nSafra Catz: Yeah, it is really still to come. It is -- we're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. So it's starting to come, but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse, and customers have to get comfortable with it. And also, multi-cloud has to really roll out, and that's going to be another piece of it. So customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI, they can go in their cloud to customer. They can go in OCI at Azure is one possibility. So there's just -- it is the absolute beginning. Because remember, the Oracle database is not a toy. It's a mission critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. And so this is coming and it's just the beginning. So you see what's going on with OCI, no one believed us this was possible, now here we're at, and then right behind it is going to come the database, and that's going to be something.\nJohn DiFucci: And per Larry's comments, and I'll stop talking, but for Larry's comments, the database gross margins, given the autonomous nature of it, we should expect that to be different than the OCI core Infrastructure as a Service gross margin?\nSafra Catz: Yes, absolutely. Database\u2026\nLarry Ellison: I don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is, one, autonomous, there's no labor associated with it, but it's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores, there's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. So if you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate. I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database and that's seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you very much. Sorry for the several part question, but thank you.\nSafra Catz: Our pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you very much for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I want to change gears a little bit and turn to Cerner, which people don't really focus on that much. Cerner license revenue has been down, likely in preparation for customer shifting to SaaS, but Oracle does not yet have a full multi-tenant scalable Cerner SaaS solution. So what I'd like to ask is couple parts. How should we think about the timing of, one, the availability of -- yep.\nLarry Ellison: That's not correct. So Cerner has several pieces.\nMark Moerdler: Okay.\nLarry Ellison: And I believe about half the customers will be moved, half of the Millennium customers. You can think that Cerner is just automating hospitals like Epic. And that's a product called Millennium. And about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI. But we've also developed something that began at Cerner. And we have finished now, completely rewritten it. Well, we're in the process. We will finish next calendar year. But it is largely rewritten and available right now, something called our Health and Data Intelligence platform and it was known as Cerner HealtheIntent. And that's for public health. That's for population scale, public health management. Again, it's sold to US states. It's sold to Australian states. It's sold to European countries. It's for managing population health. Remember during COVID when we didn't know, New York thought they were living out of hospital rooms, but they really weren't, but no one knew, because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There was no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully staffed and it is available right now. So some of the pieces, some of the Cerner pieces are coming online, other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI. And they're all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis.\nMark Moerdler: So that's very helpful. So that starts to answer the question I was asking was how should we think about the timing of the transition, Millennium you're saying is going to be an OCI. Is that going to be a fully SaaS version? When will the rest of the solutions be fully SaaS? And how should we think about the revenue lift as the license and maintenance moves to the cloud -- to SaaS?\nLarry Ellison: So it will be fully an OCI and SaaS, but it will not be the new, we are rewriting, we are replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift and shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time, and different pieces will be available starting next year. And so, Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of Millennium as Millennium moves to OCI. And again, half the customers will be in OCI by February. So we're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. But we're also adding much of new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce, really what we think of is our health division in Oracle has products for the entire healthcare ecosystems. Payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies, and public health departments in national governments and state governments. So we have products for the entire healthcare ecosystem, which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. So we are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. So we expect Cerner to be a growth story. I guess that's what I'm getting at.\nMark Moerdler: Right, that's where I'm going with the question.\nSafra Catz: Yeah, so let me just tell you, I think for the year, for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of negative 1 to 2 points. But that will be it. It'll end this fiscal year. And from then on, it will be a growth story. So it will no longer be a drag on Oracle growth. Okay?\nMark Moerdler: Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It was very helpful.\nSafra Catz: Great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question, Larry and Safra. Many mission critical workloads still run on Oracle database, and you have a sticky [Indiscernible] team. And we expect Oracle will start migrating those database workloads to OCI, which will bring 3x revenue uplift, which you call even the third leg of cloud growth. You also have now OCI inside Azure data center. So my question is, how does this being multi-cloud change your outlook for Oracle database? And what are you hearing from your database customer in terms of their comfort and preparedness to move their Oracle database to the cloud, either OCI or Azure?\nSafra Catz: Larry, why don't you start with this?\nLarry Ellison: Safra, can you go first?\nSafra Catz: No, yes, I do. You go.\nLarry Ellison: Okay, thanks. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, mini computers, [broadly] (ph) and HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer. Now, in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same flex -- our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle. They want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft Cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud. They'd want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them, it's very important to have it in Japan, for example. It's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research, who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going that same direction. So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu, or they bought it from Hitachi, or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own, have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that's something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's data. They want a public cloud, they want a full OCI, they want every part of OCI. But they don't want anyone else in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can.\nKen Bond: Next question, please.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you, Larry.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line\u2026\nLarry Ellison: Let me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle, any way you want to get Oracle, you'll be able to get it. It'll be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on demand -- on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 Exadata racks. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you can put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks, Larry, for the color.\nLarry Ellison: And that's Microsoft alone, okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask around some of the GenAI functionality inside of the applications portfolio, specifically Fusion and NetSuite. Any update or uptick that you're seeing or can share around some of your partnerships around Cohere? Maybe any early feedback from the field that informs incremental value capture, whether or not it's starting to resonate either in the form of increased migration activity, increased market share gains, or increased monetization opportunities around the application portfolio?\nLarry Ellison: Yeah, well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new tele -- again, I mentioned it, and then it's Cerner that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did in what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunication module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time we've done it, we now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe that the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So, it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it. And of course, we're using it in all in an -- everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those, you've read about all of those, we've actually got those implemented and are delivering those to customers. But even in the most challenging areas, in drug design, we're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people and well, another area in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise, and then they get the news weeks sooner, from just the immediate AI processing of the biopsy image, they find out weeks sooner whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free. And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imaging. So, no, we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex healthcare and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise, but still very important in making your employees in your company more efficient and more competitive.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And then from a monetization standpoint, do you -- is this monetizing in a copilot way similar to Microsoft, or how do you envision ultimately seeing some of the incremental value capture inside of the model?\nLarry Ellison: Well, we think inside of our -- remember we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in healthcare. We run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run ambulatory clinics. We run -- we have diagnostic databases for -- image processing databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance. Right now, without once again, I can't spend too much time on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified and the patients aren't notified, reminding, we're doing all of that. We're doing a bunch of things with and that's the high end, that's the high value end of AI when you're preventing someone from being re-hospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSafra Catz: Now we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it, not only as part of our application, but also as part of our infrastructure. Because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers when they use our product to basically use their private data in some of these models for them to learn, but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications, and this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot of\u2026\nLarry Ellison: Safra is making a very good point in that we have our own applications in healthcare, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imaging, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that, but they're using our AI to develop their healthcare application. So, we monetize through imaging, enabling them to build their AI application. And we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the two.\nSafra Catz: Okay.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nSafra Catz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. Larry, it's taken Oracle several years to reach 66 cloud data centers. And you're now talking about plans to build 100 new ones, which frankly seems very ambitious. What is it that you're seeing that maybe we don't see? And then related, perhaps, Safra, if you could speak to the capital requirements and time frame for that, especially in light of CapEx this quarter, that was a bit less than we had expected? Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Well, okay, how about Microsoft puts an order -- in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're saying. When one company, as you say, we have 60, by the way, that's a little bit misplaced. That's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions and we sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always -- they don't, data center and regions don't necessarily translate one to one. But the -- when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of the Azure cloud. So those are the kinds of things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand and then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers from Microsoft. The combination of the two adds up to 100.\nSafra Catz: Yeah, and also one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many clouded customers, which started small, and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a clouded customer, which is smaller, and they decide, no, no, no, now I want a dedicated region of my own. I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own. Also really, it is absolutely true, we did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate, whether to build something small which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me. So as I think I've hinted and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we had made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger, instead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and try to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs.\nLarry Ellison: Let me give you one example of that, what Safra is describing, is we got enough Nvidia GPUs for Elon Musk's company xAI to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy did they want a lot more. Boy did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few, but they wanted more and we are in the process of getting them more. So, the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more. There's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter, and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks very much.\nKen Bond: Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, cloud services and license support, is now 74% of the revenue, and it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen, and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now, more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things. Creating the second generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission critical systems. Third, we recognize that customers need deployment flexibility rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated cloud to customer, dedicated region, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out. Now, to the Q2 results. With total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and the EPS at the high end of guidance. Now, as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and we're up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55%, with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40%, and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen 2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4% including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%. This is because of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter-end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%. And free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to seek cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, nine national security regions, and two EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have seven Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many clouded customer installations. The sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantages for us in the marketplace. Finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal \u201826 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry, you want me to take it or you? How about I get started? So, where do we expect OCI to go from here? Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers handed over and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. So the reality is, as we roll out and we've got just so many moving parts as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online. And as you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use. And of course, also as more GPUs become available, and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand. Larry, I don't know if you want to say anything else? Yes, we're not demand limited in any way right now. Yes, and I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I give you more detail, is I show you a number that is a mix of cloud and support. And obviously, support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works, and because we are at such a large scale. But the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable, and our IaaS, our OCI business, is improving profitability as it grows. And so the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up. So yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up. Because once the day -- the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space, but we grow in pieces. Unlike some of the others that they have to do a full out build out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue, that's not how we work. We -- and more and more of our -- so we start small and build up and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that? Yes. Yeah, it is really still to come. It is -- we're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. So it's starting to come, but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse, and customers have to get comfortable with it. And also, multi-cloud has to really roll out, and that's going to be another piece of it. So customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI, they can go in their cloud to customer. They can go in OCI at Azure is one possibility. So there's just -- it is the absolute beginning. Because remember, the Oracle database is not a toy. It's a mission critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. And so this is coming and it's just the beginning. So you see what's going on with OCI, no one believed us this was possible, now here we're at, and then right behind it is going to come the database, and that's going to be something. Yes, absolutely. Database... Our pleasure. Yeah, so let me just tell you, I think for the year, for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of negative 1 to 2 points. But that will be it. It'll end this fiscal year. And from then on, it will be a growth story. So it will no longer be a drag on Oracle growth. Okay? Great. Larry, why don't you start with this? No, yes, I do. You go. Now we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it, not only as part of our application, but also as part of our infrastructure. Because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers when they use our product to basically use their private data in some of these models for them to learn, but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications, and this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot of... Okay. Thank you. Yeah, and also one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many clouded customers, which started small, and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a clouded customer, which is smaller, and they decide, no, no, no, now I want a dedicated region of my own. I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own. Also really, it is absolutely true, we did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate, whether to build something small which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me. So as I think I've hinted and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we had made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger, instead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and try to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs."

            "content": "Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to this sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud Infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion dollar Cloud Infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for Cloud Infrastructure services and new Oracle cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by Generative AI customers, but also by nation states buying sovereign Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies, buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle cloud data centers, and perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers, co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle cloud data centers, co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle cloud database. We're able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated, with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services, and applications. Oracle cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, healthcare, and commercial workloads to the Oracle cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies, have also contracted with us to build Oracle cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate, and a huge US defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken. No, either one, Safra, you tell me. Yeah, well again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign two additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used and that's accurate. There's no reason why -- OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger and actually the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online. We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize it's not just GenAI demand. There is huge pent-up cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds, where people -- governments haven't been able to move their workloads. A lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, five, six, seven large companies in Japan that will be building at least two data centers, Oracle data centers each. So again, the demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast. And I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years. Yeah I do. I think one thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. So to give you an idea, Oracle Cloud -- to run Oracle Cloud we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the autonomous database. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated. Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system is fully autonomous. There's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software, but not running the software, it doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it costs us to run 10 in terms of DBAs or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux. So we have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things, we can bring them up relatively quickly and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated, there are far fewer errors and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving. Grown a lot. I don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is, one, autonomous, there's no labor associated with it, but it's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores, there's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. So if you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate. I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database and that's seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins. That's not correct. So Cerner has several pieces. And I believe about half the customers will be moved, half of the Millennium customers. You can think that Cerner is just automating hospitals like Epic. And that's a product called Millennium. And about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI. But we've also developed something that began at Cerner. And we have finished now, completely rewritten it. Well, we're in the process. We will finish next calendar year. But it is largely rewritten and available right now, something called our Health and Data Intelligence platform and it was known as Cerner HealtheIntent. And that's for public health. That's for population scale, public health management. Again, it's sold to US states. It's sold to Australian states. It's sold to European countries. It's for managing population health. Remember during COVID when we didn't know, New York thought they were living out of hospital rooms, but they really weren't, but no one knew, because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There was no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully staffed and it is available right now. So some of the pieces, some of the Cerner pieces are coming online, other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI. And they're all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis. So it will be fully an OCI and SaaS, but it will not be the new, we are rewriting, we are replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift and shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time, and different pieces will be available starting next year. And so, Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of Millennium as Millennium moves to OCI. And again, half the customers will be in OCI by February. So we're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. But we're also adding much of new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce, really what we think of is our health division in Oracle has products for the entire healthcare ecosystems. Payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies, and public health departments in national governments and state governments. So we have products for the entire healthcare ecosystem, which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. So we are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. So we expect Cerner to be a growth story. I guess that's what I'm getting at. Safra, can you go first? Okay, thanks. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, mini computers, [broadly] (ph) and HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer. Now, in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same flex -- our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle. They want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft Cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud. They'd want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them, it's very important to have it in Japan, for example. It's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research, who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going that same direction. So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu, or they bought it from Hitachi, or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own, have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that's something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's data. They want a public cloud, they want a full OCI, they want every part of OCI. But they don't want anyone else in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can. Let me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle, any way you want to get Oracle, you'll be able to get it. It'll be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on demand -- on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 Exadata racks. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you can put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware. And that's Microsoft alone, okay. Yeah, well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new tele -- again, I mentioned it, and then it's Cerner that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did in what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunication module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time we've done it, we now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe that the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So, it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it. And of course, we're using it in all in an -- everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those, you've read about all of those, we've actually got those implemented and are delivering those to customers. But even in the most challenging areas, in drug design, we're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people and well, another area in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise, and then they get the news weeks sooner, from just the immediate AI processing of the biopsy image, they find out weeks sooner whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free. And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imaging. So, no, we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex healthcare and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise, but still very important in making your employees in your company more efficient and more competitive. Well, we think inside of our -- remember we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in healthcare. We run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run ambulatory clinics. We run -- we have diagnostic databases for -- image processing databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance. Right now, without once again, I can't spend too much time on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified and the patients aren't notified, reminding, we're doing all of that. We're doing a bunch of things with and that's the high end, that's the high value end of AI when you're preventing someone from being re-hospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money. Safra is making a very good point in that we have our own applications in healthcare, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imaging, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that, but they're using our AI to develop their healthcare application. So, we monetize through imaging, enabling them to build their AI application. And we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the two. Well, okay, how about Microsoft puts an order -- in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're saying. When one company, as you say, we have 60, by the way, that's a little bit misplaced. That's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions and we sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always -- they don't, data center and regions don't necessarily translate one to one. But the -- when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of the Azure cloud. So those are the kinds of things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand and then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers from Microsoft. The combination of the two adds up to 100. Let me give you one example of that, what Safra is describing, is we got enough Nvidia GPUs for Elon Musk's company xAI to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy did they want a lot more. Boy did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few, but they wanted more and we are in the process of getting them more. So, the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more. There's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter, and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter."

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 22 years ago today was a traumatic day for our country. Like many of you, it feels like yesterday when the country lost nearly 3,000 souls. And we at Oracle, we lost 11 employees. I remember exactly where I was when the tragedy unfolded, and it is still so hard speaking about it even all these years later. Today, we honor and remember each one of the victims and heroes and we hope that their memories are a blessing to all of us. Now before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought it would help to start with some of the things that are going on at Oracle that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of weeks. Next week, we have Oracle CloudWorld, which will showcase the latest innovations, including AI on OCI, the progress of Oracle Autonomous Database, our multi-cloud strategy, the use of Oracle Analytics throughout our portfolio to drive better decision-making and the use of generative AI to differentiate Fusion, NetSuite and our industry application. Now, CloudWorld is our marquee event each year where current and prospective customers take time out of their busy calendars to join us in person and share their experiences. We know that there are no better spokespeople for our products and services than our existing customers. Our innovation results directly from our development teams interacting with customers to anticipate and build the next generation of products and services. Some of the customers you will hear from next week include NVIDIA, Uber, Ascension Health, Cohere and many, many, many, many more. You'll also hear from our expanding set of strategic partners that are driving the Oracle ecosystem and this includes Amdocs, VMware, Microsoft. Overall, it's remarkable the interest we are getting from the ISV community to work with Oracle. There are a lot of discussions going on and you will see more announcements shortly. From a financial standpoint, we see this customer and partner ecosystem as a leading indicator of our income statement. I've been talking with you about our revenue acceleration for some time now. In Q1, our remaining performance obligations or RPO, climbed to nearly $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner, up 11%. We have now signed several deals for OCI greater than $1 billion in total value. In the first week of Q2, we booked an additional $1.5 billion in business, which isn't even included in the Q1 numbers. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. My point here is that customer momentum is continuing to build. This momentum is turning into bookings and that gives me the confidence that our annual revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward. Now to the Q1 results, which I remind you, I am announcing on day 11, only because day eight when we were ready was a Friday and I know none of you like that. So this quarter we saw a modest currency tailwind, but as always, I'll discuss our financials using constant currency growth rates. Clearly, Q1 was another great quarter with total revenue at the midpoint of guidance and earnings per share $0.02 above the high-end of guidance and our cloud growth was 29%. Total cloud revenue, SaaS and IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4 billion, up 29%. Now including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 29% also at $4.6 billion, and with our IaaS revenue at $1.5 billion, up 64%, and SaaS revenue of $3.1 billion, up 17%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.5 billion, up 12%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.5 billion, up 11%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $6.9 billion, and they grew 20%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.1 billion, up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 64%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 72% with an annualized revenue of $5.6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 91%. Exadata Cloud Services revenue was up 46% and Autonomous Database was up 42%. Database subscription services, which includes license support, were up 6% highlighted by cloud database services which were up 44%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud of database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $0.8 billion, down 11% following an amazing Q1 last year of 19% growth, which made it a tough compare this year. So in all, total revenue for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 8% including Cerner, up 9% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%, with IaaS gross margins improving substantially from last year. And while we\u2019ve continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our IaaS margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses very carefully to ensure our gross margin percentages expand as we scale up. To this point, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 41%, up from 39% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19 in US dollars, up 16% in USD, up 14% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.86 in USD. At quarter end, we had nearly $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.1 billion, up 5%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was up 9% to $7 billion, while free cash flow was up 21% to $5.7 billion and I expect that we will see a very good result in our free cash flow for the rest of the year. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.7 billion, up 68% and free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 76%. Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion over the last four quarters and we are clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion in Q1 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers\u2019 growing needs. Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect that fiscal year 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year's CapEx. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud business. We now have 64 cloud regions live with 44 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure. We also have nine dedicated regions live and 11 more planned, nine security regions and 12 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And of course, we have many, many clouded customer implementations. The cost advantages, sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to make us so compelling in the marketplace to customers. As we've said many, many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter we repurchased 1.3 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now before I dive into Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see longer-term. Per my earlier remarks, we have a great line of sight into the trajectory of the business, given the bookings momentum. We are extremely confident about our revenue acceleration for the year, even though in any quarter there may be small fluctuations. Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is building data centers as quickly as possible. In addition, we are in an accelerated transition of Cerner to the cloud. This transition is resulting in some near-term headwinds to the Cerner growth rate as customers move from license purchases, which are recognized upfront to cloud subscriptions, which are recognized ratably. Again, excluding Cerner, I remain committed to accelerating our total revenue growth rate this fiscal year as well as maintaining our current high cloud growth rate for the year. And as you will hear at our financial analyst meeting next week, we remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.03 positive effect on EPS in Q2. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Here we go, total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 5% to 7% in USD at today's rates. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and expected to grow 8% to 10% in USD. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner, again, I give you these numbers, so you can see the mainline business, is expected to grow from 27% to 29% in constant currency and is expected to grow 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% to 9%, and be between $1.27 and $1.31 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 11% and be between $1.30 and $1.34 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.\nLarry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. So, is generative AI is the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe, and we are about to find out. Self-driving cars, computer-designed antiviral drugs, voice user interfaces. Generative AI is changing the automobile industry, the pharmaceutical industry, how people communicate with their computers. Generative AI is changing everything. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation 2 cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we had booked at the end of the last Q4. I'm also very pleased to announce that Exai has signed the contract to do training in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason, Oracle's RDMA interconnected NVIDIA superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and much less than half the cost of other clouds but growth in our AI cloud infrastructure business is not the only exciting news we have to report at Oracle. Our cloud applications business is doing quite well and it's about to get even better. In the current quarter we expect our Cerner Health business to be awarded two large new contracts with a total value of over $1 billion. And I\u2019m now able to announce that all nine utility companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are in the process of replacing all their existing ERP systems, and standardizing on Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications. Let me conclude with a few words about our database business and our upcoming announcement with Microsoft later this week. We will be substantially expanding our existing multi-cloud partnership with Microsoft by making it easier for Microsoft Azure customers to buy and use the latest Oracle cloud database technology in combination with Microsoft Azure cloud services. Satya and I will discuss the details of our expanding partnership at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond on the 14th. Please tune in, and thank you. Back to you, Safra.\nSafra Catz: Thanks, Larry. And maybe, Ken, we could start taking questions at this point.\nKen Bond: Absolutely. Before we do that, Lisa, just one quick clarification, that we currently have two EU sovereign regions live with more to come. Lisa, please poll the audience for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks very much, and congrats on the strong start to the year. Larry, I think it's fair to say that you understand the laws of data gravity better than anyone and you have monetized this fundamental concept as well as anyone over the years. And I recently heard someone say, we are moving from a world of data gravity to one of AI gravity, and I'm not sure exactly what that means, or they even knew what that meant, but with AI and other use cases attracting more and more data to central clouds, with many vendors preaching data sharing instead of what used to be making multiple copies of things and keeping them synchronized, does AI plus cloud in any way break what we've always understood about data gravity? And what does that mean for Oracle?\nLarry Ellison: Well, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI -- generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that -- this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train -- OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say, and we are partners. Imaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own -- another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle's new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases. So we think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deepwater of the information age. Nothing has changed about that. The demands on data are getting stronger and more important.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much for your perspective, Larry.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much. So Larry, companies are starting to understand that OCI has a very fundamentally different architecture than anything else out there in the market because of the non-blocking, low-latency network design. I'm wondering, if you think it's possible to actually pull further ahead through some of your other initiatives. For instance, the Azure Interconnect, it sounds like you're going to expand that. Having more regions, running a stronger database, providing greater isolation, just wondering if you think there is a possibility of extending the lead?\nLarry Ellison: Well, again, our -- we have -- we are on our second generation of data center, and our second generation of cloud. Now a lot of people notice that we were a little bit late to the party, but that's because we moved from a generation which we were not very happy with to a second generation, which we think solved a lot of problems the other cloud companies have not yet solved. So the non-blocking ultrafast RDMA network is not only useful for AI -- training AI models, it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database. It's useful for, in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers, our data centers are 100% automated. They configure themselves. They run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor. Now that saves us a huge amount of money, a lot of labor cost is saved. But the biggest advantage is, if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors. You don't have mistakes. You can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center. That's another huge advantage. Our data centers are -- because they're all identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same and they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones, but they are identical, they all have the same hardware pieces and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation and that automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many, many more data centers than any other cloud provider. But we also put those data centers at customers. Nomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle Cloud capacity in Japan has two dedicated regions and are building two more. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. And, again, it's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included with our data center. So we have cost advantages, we have performance advantages, we have security advantages. And that's why we are growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Larry, you mentioned Berkshire, and them moving over to Fusion. I just wanted to talk in -- more bigger picture on the back-office systems, like, in the olden days, back-office, you wouldn't touch, in kind of tougher times because they are big complex project. But you guys are still kind of growing this nicely with over 20%. Like what are you seeing there? And do you see a change in pipelines, change in customer interest of doing something there? Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Yeah, well the back-office in the cloud is very different than the back-office on-premise. And we have a big advantage that we are by far and away the biggest. I don't know, 95% of the cloud ERP market in terms of actual live customers using it. And we have an important partnership with JPMorgan Chase and we'll be announcing some more partnerships in the financial community at the upcoming CloudWorld, where we automate a lot of e-commerce, B2B e-commerce right in the cloud. So what is B2B big e-commerce between two Oracle Cloud customers, two Oracle ERP cloud customers? It's one Oracle procurement system talking to another Oracle order management system and financing the transaction through their bank. We automate that entirely in the cloud. If your bank is JPMorgan Chase, they originate the loan right along with your purchase. It\u2019s e-commerce for B2B, with banking and shipping and insurance, all included and rolled together. No one -- we've done a great job as an industry, automating e-commerce for B2C. I mean, Amazon, Walmart, others have done a brilliant job in that. We've been doing that for a long time. We have not got the equivalent in B2B commerce because B2B transactions are much more complex. In the cloud, you can get all the parties together, the shippers, the insurance company, the manufacturers, the purchasers and we can automate that entirely within the Oracle Cloud. One ERP system talking to another, talking to their bank, talking to their insurance, doing a loan origination, getting it shipped and insured. So we make doing business much easier for our customers when they move to a modern cloud ERP system versus the on-premise ERP system that came before.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you so much for taking my question. The top-of-mind questions I'm getting are related to AI in general as you'd expect and were specifically as it relates to Oracle, what the impact of AI will be on OCI Gen 2. Two related parts to the question. The first is the profitability of AI supercomputers and whether if some clients try to tell me, it's low-calorie, empty-calorie revenue or can you maintain margins as this business grows? And the second part is about the Oracle ecosystem, and is it strong enough that its workloads transition from model training to inferencing and grounding, could AI compute create a revenue air pocket or [is the ecosystem] (ph) strong enough so you don't have that. Thank you.\nLarry Ellison: Well, if you're -- you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're in -- obviously in the healthcare field, in the legal field, new cases are being judged, new researches being published all the time and for your AI models to be relevant they have to be up-to-date. So it's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. So you're training and your inferencing sit right next to each other. As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else that's on the -- not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, then we are going to be half the cost or better. So we think we are going to be very, very competitive across the board whether it's training or an inferencing. So we don't -- so we are pretty confident that we've got a cost-performance advantages. Again, if you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour. So the performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us. We don't see that going away anytime soon, and it applies to inferencing as well as well as training. Now as far as GPUs, are GPUs a low-margin business? Not for a 100% automated cloud with very, very low cost. We think, in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable by the way, for us, but are often lower -- our prices are lower than the cost of other hyperscalers doing the training.\nMark Moerdler: Thank you. That's very helpful.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill in on Cerner, basically, the one-year anniversary of that acquisition. And maybe from Larry, get an update on where we are with modernizing that solution and modernizing that product? And basically then whether Cerner has kind of lived up to your expectations thus far? And then maybe for Safra. If we could dig into the expense synergy side of the equation, you guys have done a great job increasing margins on a year-on-year basis in this quarter, how much is left to go within Cerner and getting that margin profile to match the broader Oracle margin profile?\nLarry Ellison: Okay. I'll talk about the progress on taking the existing Millennium\u2019s Cerner software and moving it to new Millennium. We basically rewriting that software piece at a time by the way. It's not going to be a big rip and replace it all. There's a two-phase process with Cerner. The first thing is to get the lift and shift and get the existing system hardened, which we've done and moving the customers to the cloud, which we are in the process of moving everybody to the cloud. That will give them better performance, better security and new features will then start showing up with the system. And so there's a two-phase shift to the cloud, we are well on our way. The next is replace feature after feature after feature of the older Cerner system with a new Cerner system, new Millennium, which we are not coding in Java, like we usually do. The new Cerner system is being generated, as you know, generative AI generates code. We have an application generator called APEX. And we are not writing code for the new Cerner. We are generating that code in APEX, and it's going extremely well. Again, one of the great things about code generators is they don't make mistakes. Well, either they make the same mistake over and over again or once you fix the mistake, you fix it everywhere. So the code gen -- we are using a code generator, and to write the new features in Cerner and it's coming along very, very nicely. Also on the business side of things, we -- again, we think that Cerner business is going to get stronger and stronger again, Safra made the point. The old Cerner business you'd sell licenses. You sell a big contract and you get a big chunk of revenue in that quarter. Our new business model, as you know is cloud, so we get a big Cerner award and we get that money now over time rather than all upfront. So that's, if you will, a bit of a revenue headwind, but the Cerner business is doing extraordinarily well.\nSafra Catz: And on the expense side, we still have a ways to go, but I think it will become more obvious to you next quarter the changes we've made, as they play out through the income statement more clearly. And so you'll have a better comparison, Q2 to Q2, which will be a full non-deal quarter for you to look at. But you know us, we are always looking to save as much as we can, and to spend as little while still really transforming Cerner into a modern system in its entirety.\nLarry Ellison: Let me let me just reinforce what Safra just said. We love to save money. One of the things we did with our data centers is we automated them. We -- what we saved labor costs and we saved -- we have better security and better reliability because we eliminated human error. With Cerner, the rewrite of Cerner, it's not armies of programmers that are going be rewriting this. We are generating the new Millennium software using APEX. And that's also going to save us a lot of human labor and generate higher quality code and higher quality user interfaces and better security all at once.\nKeith Weiss: Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We will take our last question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. My question is for Safra, I think. Safra, if the organic constant currency cloud growth was in line with what you did last year and what you want to do for this year at 29%, while license, though it was a difficult comp it was a bit weaker, at least than the street was expecting. And I also -- we also realize that cloud revenue for the same amount of business booked will be a lot less than the equivalent license revenue in the quarter. But does this mean we are seeing a move with stronger momentum to the cloud this quarter than we have seen? And I guess just to clarify, given your guidance for the second quarter, you said you're maintaining your longer-term. Safra, I just wanted to clarify. Are you maintaining your constant currency organic cloud guidance for the year?\nSafra Catz: Yes, okay. Let me start with yes. And as I want to remind you of course, I want to remind you 29% of bigger numbers is more. Okay. So, you know, last year we were smaller, and this year we continue to plan on doing the 29% may be better, all of it is dependent on us getting our data centers filled up and built out as fast as possible. The level of demand we have is stunning. Stunning is the only word I can use, and I don't want to get over overly exuberant simply because we do have to continue to build out our systems, et cetera. And so yes, a very strong momentum to the cloud, and again with the focus we told you. We are bringing our customers to the cloud and that's going to have us focusing on growing that and stronger momentum there.\nJohn DiFucci: Okay, great. Very clear. Yes and yes. Got it. Thanks.\nKen Bond: All right. Thank you, John, and thank you, Lisa. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Safra Catz",
            "content": "Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 22 years ago today was a traumatic day for our country. Like many of you, it feels like yesterday when the country lost nearly 3,000 souls. And we at Oracle, we lost 11 employees. I remember exactly where I was when the tragedy unfolded, and it is still so hard speaking about it even all these years later. Today, we honor and remember each one of the victims and heroes and we hope that their memories are a blessing to all of us. Now before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought it would help to start with some of the things that are going on at Oracle that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of weeks. Next week, we have Oracle CloudWorld, which will showcase the latest innovations, including AI on OCI, the progress of Oracle Autonomous Database, our multi-cloud strategy, the use of Oracle Analytics throughout our portfolio to drive better decision-making and the use of generative AI to differentiate Fusion, NetSuite and our industry application. Now, CloudWorld is our marquee event each year where current and prospective customers take time out of their busy calendars to join us in person and share their experiences. We know that there are no better spokespeople for our products and services than our existing customers. Our innovation results directly from our development teams interacting with customers to anticipate and build the next generation of products and services. Some of the customers you will hear from next week include NVIDIA, Uber, Ascension Health, Cohere and many, many, many, many more. You'll also hear from our expanding set of strategic partners that are driving the Oracle ecosystem and this includes Amdocs, VMware, Microsoft. Overall, it's remarkable the interest we are getting from the ISV community to work with Oracle. There are a lot of discussions going on and you will see more announcements shortly. From a financial standpoint, we see this customer and partner ecosystem as a leading indicator of our income statement. I've been talking with you about our revenue acceleration for some time now. In Q1, our remaining performance obligations or RPO, climbed to nearly $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner, up 11%. We have now signed several deals for OCI greater than $1 billion in total value. In the first week of Q2, we booked an additional $1.5 billion in business, which isn't even included in the Q1 numbers. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. My point here is that customer momentum is continuing to build. This momentum is turning into bookings and that gives me the confidence that our annual revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward. Now to the Q1 results, which I remind you, I am announcing on day 11, only because day eight when we were ready was a Friday and I know none of you like that. So this quarter we saw a modest currency tailwind, but as always, I'll discuss our financials using constant currency growth rates. Clearly, Q1 was another great quarter with total revenue at the midpoint of guidance and earnings per share $0.02 above the high-end of guidance and our cloud growth was 29%. Total cloud revenue, SaaS and IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4 billion, up 29%. Now including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 29% also at $4.6 billion, and with our IaaS revenue at $1.5 billion, up 64%, and SaaS revenue of $3.1 billion, up 17%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.5 billion, up 12%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.5 billion, up 11%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $6.9 billion, and they grew 20%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.1 billion, up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 64%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 72% with an annualized revenue of $5.6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 91%. Exadata Cloud Services revenue was up 46% and Autonomous Database was up 42%. Database subscription services, which includes license support, were up 6% highlighted by cloud database services which were up 44%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud of database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $0.8 billion, down 11% following an amazing Q1 last year of 19% growth, which made it a tough compare this year. So in all, total revenue for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 8% including Cerner, up 9% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%, with IaaS gross margins improving substantially from last year. And while we've continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our IaaS margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses very carefully to ensure our gross margin percentages expand as we scale up. To this point, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 41%, up from 39% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19 in US dollars, up 16% in USD, up 14% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.86 in USD. At quarter end, we had nearly $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.1 billion, up 5%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was up 9% to $7 billion, while free cash flow was up 21% to $5.7 billion and I expect that we will see a very good result in our free cash flow for the rest of the year. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.7 billion, up 68% and free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 76%. Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion over the last four quarters and we are clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion in Q1 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect that fiscal year 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year's CapEx. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud business. We now have 64 cloud regions live with 44 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure. We also have nine dedicated regions live and 11 more planned, nine security regions and 12 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And of course, we have many, many clouded customer implementations. The cost advantages, sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to make us so compelling in the marketplace to customers. As we've said many, many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter we repurchased 1.3 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now before I dive into Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see longer-term. Per my earlier remarks, we have a great line of sight into the trajectory of the business, given the bookings momentum. We are extremely confident about our revenue acceleration for the year, even though in any quarter there may be small fluctuations. Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is building data centers as quickly as possible. In addition, we are in an accelerated transition of Cerner to the cloud. This transition is resulting in some near-term headwinds to the Cerner growth rate as customers move from license purchases, which are recognized upfront to cloud subscriptions, which are recognized ratably. Again, excluding Cerner, I remain committed to accelerating our total revenue growth rate this fiscal year as well as maintaining our current high cloud growth rate for the year. And as you will hear at our financial analyst meeting next week, we remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.03 positive effect on EPS in Q2. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Here we go, total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 5% to 7% in USD at today's rates. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and expected to grow 8% to 10% in USD. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner, again, I give you these numbers, so you can see the mainline business, is expected to grow from 27% to 29% in constant currency and is expected to grow 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% to 9%, and be between $1.27 and $1.31 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 11% and be between $1.30 and $1.34 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Thanks, Larry. And maybe, Ken, we could start taking questions at this point. And on the expense side, we still have a ways to go, but I think it will become more obvious to you next quarter the changes we've made, as they play out through the income statement more clearly. And so you'll have a better comparison, Q2 to Q2, which will be a full non-deal quarter for you to look at. But you know us, we are always looking to save as much as we can, and to spend as little while still really transforming Cerner into a modern system in its entirety. Yes, okay. Let me start with yes. And as I want to remind you of course, I want to remind you 29% of bigger numbers is more. Okay. So, you know, last year we were smaller, and this year we continue to plan on doing the 29% may be better, all of it is dependent on us getting our data centers filled up and built out as fast as possible. The level of demand we have is stunning. Stunning is the only word I can use, and I don't want to get over overly exuberant simply because we do have to continue to build out our systems, et cetera. And so yes, a very strong momentum to the cloud, and again with the focus we told you. We are bringing our customers to the cloud and that's going to have us focusing on growing that and stronger momentum there."

            "content": "Thank you, Safra. So, is generative AI is the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe, and we are about to find out. Self-driving cars, computer-designed antiviral drugs, voice user interfaces. Generative AI is changing the automobile industry, the pharmaceutical industry, how people communicate with their computers. Generative AI is changing everything. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation 2 cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we had booked at the end of the last Q4. I'm also very pleased to announce that Exai has signed the contract to do training in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason, Oracle's RDMA interconnected NVIDIA superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and much less than half the cost of other clouds but growth in our AI cloud infrastructure business is not the only exciting news we have to report at Oracle. Our cloud applications business is doing quite well and it's about to get even better. In the current quarter we expect our Cerner Health business to be awarded two large new contracts with a total value of over $1 billion. And I'm now able to announce that all nine utility companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are in the process of replacing all their existing ERP systems, and standardizing on Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications. Let me conclude with a few words about our database business and our upcoming announcement with Microsoft later this week. We will be substantially expanding our existing multi-cloud partnership with Microsoft by making it easier for Microsoft Azure customers to buy and use the latest Oracle cloud database technology in combination with Microsoft Azure cloud services. Satya and I will discuss the details of our expanding partnership at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond on the 14th. Please tune in, and thank you. Back to you, Safra. Well, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI -- generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that -- this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train -- OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say, and we are partners. Imaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own -- another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle's new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases. So we think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deepwater of the information age. Nothing has changed about that. The demands on data are getting stronger and more important. Well, again, our -- we have -- we are on our second generation of data center, and our second generation of cloud. Now a lot of people notice that we were a little bit late to the party, but that's because we moved from a generation which we were not very happy with to a second generation, which we think solved a lot of problems the other cloud companies have not yet solved. So the non-blocking ultrafast RDMA network is not only useful for AI -- training AI models, it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database. It's useful for, in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers, our data centers are 100% automated. They configure themselves. They run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor. Now that saves us a huge amount of money, a lot of labor cost is saved. But the biggest advantage is, if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors. You don't have mistakes. You can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center. That's another huge advantage. Our data centers are -- because they're all identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same and they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones, but they are identical, they all have the same hardware pieces and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation and that automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many, many more data centers than any other cloud provider. But we also put those data centers at customers. Nomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle Cloud capacity in Japan has two dedicated regions and are building two more. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. And, again, it's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included with our data center. So we have cost advantages, we have performance advantages, we have security advantages. And that's why we are growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers. Yeah, well the back-office in the cloud is very different than the back-office on-premise. And we have a big advantage that we are by far and away the biggest. I don't know, 95% of the cloud ERP market in terms of actual live customers using it. And we have an important partnership with JPMorgan Chase and we'll be announcing some more partnerships in the financial community at the upcoming CloudWorld, where we automate a lot of e-commerce, B2B e-commerce right in the cloud. So what is B2B big e-commerce between two Oracle Cloud customers, two Oracle ERP cloud customers? It's one Oracle procurement system talking to another Oracle order management system and financing the transaction through their bank. We automate that entirely in the cloud. If your bank is JPMorgan Chase, they originate the loan right along with your purchase. It's e-commerce for B2B, with banking and shipping and insurance, all included and rolled together. No one -- we've done a great job as an industry, automating e-commerce for B2C. I mean, Amazon, Walmart, others have done a brilliant job in that. We've been doing that for a long time. We have not got the equivalent in B2B commerce because B2B transactions are much more complex. In the cloud, you can get all the parties together, the shippers, the insurance company, the manufacturers, the purchasers and we can automate that entirely within the Oracle Cloud. One ERP system talking to another, talking to their bank, talking to their insurance, doing a loan origination, getting it shipped and insured. So we make doing business much easier for our customers when they move to a modern cloud ERP system versus the on-premise ERP system that came before. Well, if you're -- you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're in -- obviously in the healthcare field, in the legal field, new cases are being judged, new researches being published all the time and for your AI models to be relevant they have to be up-to-date. So it's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. So you're training and your inferencing sit right next to each other. As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else that's on the -- not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, then we are going to be half the cost or better. So we think we are going to be very, very competitive across the board whether it's training or an inferencing. So we don't -- so we are pretty confident that we've got a cost-performance advantages. Again, if you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour. So the performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us. We don't see that going away anytime soon, and it applies to inferencing as well as well as training. Now as far as GPUs, are GPUs a low-margin business? Not for a 100% automated cloud with very, very low cost. We think, in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable by the way, for us, but are often lower -- our prices are lower than the cost of other hyperscalers doing the training. Okay. I'll talk about the progress on taking the existing Millennium's Cerner software and moving it to new Millennium. We basically rewriting that software piece at a time by the way. It's not going to be a big rip and replace it all. There's a two-phase process with Cerner. The first thing is to get the lift and shift and get the existing system hardened, which we've done and moving the customers to the cloud, which we are in the process of moving everybody to the cloud. That will give them better performance, better security and new features will then start showing up with the system. And so there's a two-phase shift to the cloud, we are well on our way. The next is replace feature after feature after feature of the older Cerner system with a new Cerner system, new Millennium, which we are not coding in Java, like we usually do. The new Cerner system is being generated, as you know, generative AI generates code. We have an application generator called APEX. And we are not writing code for the new Cerner. We are generating that code in APEX, and it's going extremely well. Again, one of the great things about code generators is they don't make mistakes. Well, either they make the same mistake over and over again or once you fix the mistake, you fix it everywhere. So the code gen -- we are using a code generator, and to write the new features in Cerner and it's coming along very, very nicely. Also on the business side of things, we -- again, we think that Cerner business is going to get stronger and stronger again, Safra made the point. The old Cerner business you'd sell licenses. You sell a big contract and you get a big chunk of revenue in that quarter. Our new business model, as you know is cloud, so we get a big Cerner award and we get that money now over time rather than all upfront. So that's, if you will, a bit of a revenue headwind, but the Cerner business is doing extraordinarily well. Let me let me just reinforce what Safra just said. We love to save money. One of the things we did with our data centers is we automated them. We -- what we saved labor costs and we saved -- we have better security and better reliability because we eliminated human error. With Cerner, the rewrite of Cerner, it's not armies of programmers that are going be rewriting this. We are generating the new Millennium software using APEX. And that's also going to save us a lot of human labor and generate higher quality code and higher quality user interfaces and better security all at once."
